The treasured Kurain Village heirloom whose name means \"7 Branched Sword\". It is said that this sacred sword represents life itself. Though the branches may appear to be infinite, the choices limitless... ...like our destinies, the sword comes to but one end. One merciless point. And when the silver cord, the fragile thread that binds us to this world, is severed... ...the illusion is revealed and the implacability of fate is finally laid bare...February 6, 9:48 AMWright & Co. Law OfficesMaya:\nHey, Nick.Phoenix:\nYeah? What is it?Maya:\nYou know how I've got spiritual powers, unlike you?Phoenix:\nUm, sure... You are a spirit medium, after all.Maya:\nBut just like you, if I don't keep my powers sharp, they get dull, right?Phoenix:\nUm... I guess so, yeah.Maya:\nGlad you agree! OK, Pearly! You're up!Phoenix:\n(Pearls...?)Pearl:\nSo! That's why we need to go on a special \"Spiritual Hot Spot Tour\", Mr. Nick!Phoenix:\n...Huh? I'm lost. What's this magazine you're shoving in my face?Pearl:\nIt's the New Year's issue of \"Oh! Cult!\", Winter Spiritual Locations Special!Phoenix:\n...Oh. (Pearls looks so happy.)Maya:\n\"Maximize your spiritual powers with just one night of intensive training!\" ...Oh! It sounds too good to be true!Phoenix:\nI'll say. It sounds more like a scam to me.Maya:\nIt's at a spiritual retreat called \"Hazakura Temple\". It's way up in the mountains, and I bet it's nice and cold. ...Just perfect for training!Phoenix:\n(Now I definitely don't want to go...)Maya:\nYou know, I think I've heard of this temple before. It's a famous channeling dojo. It's hard for even real spirit mediums like us to make reservations up there!Phoenix:\nReservations...? For a temple? Are you serious?Pearl:\nDon't worry! I've already made special reservations, just for us!Maya:\nYeah! And I signed up for the \"Special Course\"!Phoenix:\nTh-That's nice. And the timing couldn't be better. ...Since we don't have a case right now anyway.Maya:\nAlrighty then! It's settled! Well, come on! Don't just stand there! Start packing your stuff!Pearl:\nYes, Mr. Nick! You'd better start packing your stuff!Phoenix:\nHuh...? M-ME!? Why do I have to go!?Maya:\nWell, we have to be accompanied by someone over 20 years old.Phoenix:\nHey! I don't have anything to do with spirit power. The only thing I can channel is a TV. ... So, um, is there a heated pool at this \"Hazakura Temple\"?Pearl:\nNo, but you can stand under a freezing waterfall!Phoenix:\n... Sorry, but I think I'll pass. I hate cold places.Maya:\nWhaaat!? No way! How can you be so selfish!?Pearl:\nCome on, Mr. Nick! Look at this place! Doesn't it look beautiful!?Phoenix:\nNope. Not going. I'm gonna be nice and toasty at home....... .................What the...!?Pearl:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Nick?Phoenix:\nLet me see that magazine! Th-This nun...Maya:\nIs she a friend of yours or something, Nick?Phoenix:\n(Th-This girl... I-It's...!)Dahlia:\nMy name is Dahlia Hawthorne. I just want to say... It's an honor for me to be here in your noble presence.Dahlia:\nHonestly, how can any woman ever count on you for anything? ...You disgust me!Phoenix:\nBut... It can't be! (She was found guilty and should still be in prison...)Pearl:\n...Mr. Nick?Phoenix:\n... I'll go.Maya:\nHuh...?Phoenix:\nHazakura Temple... I said I'll go.Maya:\nYay! Isn't that great, Pearly!?Pearl:\nYes! Oh, thank you! Thank you, Mr. Nick! You'd do anything for Mystic Maya, right? Even walk over burning coals, right!?\"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue received from Pearls.Phoenix:\n(Dahlia Hawthorne... I knew there was no way she could possibly be at that temple... But, I just had to be see for myself... ...who this \"nun\" really was.)February 7, 3:24 PMHazakura TempleMain GateMaya:\nBrrrrr... It-It-It's so c-c-cold here, Nick!Phoenix:\nMaybe you should put on something warmer for a change!Maya:\nW-W-Well, it's supposed to be c-c-cold... It's t-t-training. ...Ah-Achoo!Phoenix:\n(Her teeth are chattering so loudly, it's all I can do to make out what she's saying...)Pearl:\nWow, Mystic Maya! So this is the famous Hazakura Temple!Maya:\nP-P-P-Pearly... I-I-I-I... Ah-Achoo!???:\nWell, well, well... How nice to see you here. Welcome to our temple!Maya:\nOh...! Th-Th-Thank you... Ah-Achoo!???:\nOh my, my, my... Thank you for coming all this way. Come now, come now. You must have been cold.Phoenix:\nWhat's with the past tense...? We're freezing into human popsicles as we spea--!???:\nHo ho ho. Well, we are high up in the mountains after all. In any case, we shouldn't speak here. ...Please follow me inside.Maya:\nTh-Thank you. I was starting to think I would pass--???:\nOh! Yes, yes! I almost forgot to introduce myself.Bikini:\nI'm the head nun here at the temple. My name is Bikini.Maya:\nB-B-B-Bikini...!?Bikini:\nThat's riiight! Actually, that's my \"temple\" name. What do you think? It's a tradition to have one, and I wanted something that has a nice image to it. So I thought, \"Why not choose a bikini?\" Besides, it makes me seem younger. Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho!Maya:\nIt certainly does! Oh, I signed up for your \"Special Course\"!Bikini:\nWell, my, my, my. Quite brave of you considering how cold it is! Young people can be so reckless with their health! Don't blame me if you become one with those you channel. Wa ha ha! Ho ho ho!Pearl:\nR-Reckless...?Maya:\n\"Wa ha ha\"...?Pearl:\nMaybe you should take it easy tonight, Mystic Maya... We can come back another day.Maya:\nBut you went through all that trouble to get reservations for m--Bikini:\nYes, yes, yes, that's right! You've come all this way, so please, enjoy yourselves! There's still time before supper, so why don't you have a look around?Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nWhat do you think, Nick? Pretty awesome gate, huh?\nPhoenix:\nIt sure is... It looks pretty well maintained, too. This thing kinda puts your hometown to shame, Maya.\nMaya:\nYeah... Well, a lot of things have happened in Kurain Village. We used to be a lot richer, back when people hired us to perform channelings.\nPhoenix:\nOh, I see... But now the place looks a bit run down...\nMaya:\nHmm... I guess I was just born in the wrong time.\n\n\n\n\nMain Hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nThat looks like the Main Hall where we'll be staying tonight. From here, it looks like one of those ice hotels you always hear about!\nPhoenix:\n...They gotta have a heater or something in there, don't you think? I don't wanna die.\nMaya:\nI'm not worried, I brought my hot-water bottle.\nPhoenix:\nDid you bring one for me?\nMaya:\nWhat are you talking about, Nick? Who carries around 2 hot-water bottles?\nPhoenix:\n(Brr! If the cold doesn't kill me, the ice queen over here will finish the job...)\n\n\n\n\nBell tower\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nOh, look! It's a cute little bell tower! I absolutely love the sound of a giant bell!\nPhoenix:\nOh? So, which do you like better? That or the sound of money?\nMaya:\n...! ...... Sorry, but I'll take money for the win, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What are you apologizing for?\n\n\n\n\nSnowmobile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nOh look, it's one of those snow motorcycle things!\nPhoenix:\nMost people call that a \"snowmobile\", you know.\nMaya:\n\"Snow motorcycle things\", \"Snowblowmeal\". Same thing. Hmm... Too bad we didn't invite Desirée. I bet she could race like the wind on this \"Slowmobile\"! Or maybe she'd give me ride on this \"Blowsnowbile\".\nPhoenix:\nArgh! I told you, it's \"snowmobile\"!Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanneling dojo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUmm... So what's a \"channeling dojo\" anyway?\nBikini:\nOh my, my, my... You don't even know that?\nMaya:\nForgive him, Sister, for he knows not what he is saying.\nBikini:\nWell, well, well. Just call me Bikini and forget that \"Sister\" part. A channeling dojo is basically a spiritual power training ground. We have special holy items prepared here to help people boost their spiritual power.\nPhoenix:\nH-Holy items...?\nBikini:\nIf you train an entire evening surrounded by these items... Aaah. It's quite mysterious. The spiritual power of these items seems to envelop you. Wa ha ha ha.\nPhoenix:\n(Wow, she must have just gotten off the trolley from the land of make-believe...)\nMaya:\nUm, so what exactly is the \"Special Course\"...?\nBikini:\nYou must be incredibly devoted to be interested in that at such a young age! It's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant a spell... ...30,000 times! All while being showered in freezing cold spirit water.\nMaya:\nEh...?\nBikini:\nIt's February now, right? You have to be careful this time of the year... If you don't watch it, you'll catch pneumonia or maybe even die of hypothermia... So be careful, you hear? Wa ha ha. Ho ho ho. Ha!\nMaya:\nHow am I supposed to \"be careful\"...?\nPearl:\nOh no... I knew I shouldn't have signed Mystic Maya up for this...\n\n\n\n\nThe other nun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUmm, Sister... About this picture...\nBikini:\nWell, well. Look at that. I must say I look rather divine here, don't you think?\nPhoenix:\nOh, um, yeah. Unforgettable in every way.\nBikini:\nYou mean it? Oh, I knew it! Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho ho! The makeup was pretty tough, but Iris helped me out.\nMaya:\n\"Iris\"...?\nBikini:\nThe cute little girl in the photo. She looks just like me, doesn't she? We're just a small temple here, so she and I run the entire place.\nMaya:\nReally? That kinda sounds like fu--\nPhoenix:\nSorry to cut in, but...! This \"Iris\"... Where is she right now?\nBikini:\nOh! Just listen to you! You haven't come all the way up here just to find a girlfriend, have you?\nPearl:\n... *glare*\nPhoenix:\nNo, no, no! Th-That's not what I had in mind at all...\nBikini:\nAnyway, Iris is in the Inner Temple preparing for this evening.\nMaya:\nInner Temple...?\nBikini:\nYes, yes, that's right. Iris will be back this evening. Why don't you go have a look at the Main Hall for now? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha.\nPhoenix:\n(So she's in the Inner Temple, huh...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm, do you think you could take a look at this?\nBikini:\nI may not look like it, but I can tell you I'm very much in demand. And to be quite honest, I'm finding this a little difficult to say...\nPearl:\n...What IS she trying to say, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI think she's trying to say that she's busy.\nMaya:\nBut seriously Nick, what's the deal? Nothing has even happened yet and you're already shoving evidence into people's faces. You need to forget about work and relax a little.\nPearl:\nTry to have some fun, OK Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, you're right... (Sure. Pin the hypothermia on the lawyer is great fun!)February 7Hazakura TempleMain HallMaya:\nBrr... It's fr-freezing in here, too! Achoo!Pearl:\nHee hee. It reminds me of the Meditation Room in Fey Manor!Phoenix:\n...Pearls, you've been in an unusually good mood since we got here.Pearl:\nWell, kids are made of energy, you know!Phoenix:\nAs for you, Maya, you look like you're about to catch a bad cold.Maya:\nW-W-Well, I'm not exactly a little kid anymore, I guess. Ah-Achoo!Phoenix:\n(Nngh... Is she going to make it...?)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSliding doors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI bet the writing on these sliding doors are instructions for spirit channeling... Kinda like how we scribbled math formulas on the bathroom walls to remember them. Except we couldn't go to the bathroom during tests... And I can't read these walls.\n\n\n\n\nObjects on floor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere are straw zabuton cushions arranged around a hibachi brazier... I haven't seen a layout like this since I saw this really old Japanese movie on TV. ...If it wasn't for this hibachi, they'd probably freeze to death.\n\n\n\n\nAltar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's an altar. It looks a bit old, but someone does a good job taking care of it. Speaking of altars, I remember seeing one like this in Kurain Village last year. I guess they really do have something to do with spiritual power after all.\n\n\n\n\nMagatama on altar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere's a laughably large Magatama on the altar. If I can see Psyche-Locks with the tiny Magatama I've got... ...I can only imagine what kind of power this bad boy has under his hood!\n\n\n\n\nLeft corner near altar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's a stack of straw zabuton cushions. Maya told me this type of zabuton is called \"enza\"... I suppose if I'd never come here, I'd have missed out on all these new things.February 7Suspension BridgeMaya:\nWow! Look at this broken down old bridge, Nick!Phoenix:\nY-Yeah, and look at that big canyon below us.Maya:\nHey! There's a river down there! It looks like it's flowing real fast! ...What's wrong, Nick? You look like you've seen a ghost!Phoenix:\nI-I'm just not very good with heights...Maya:\nOh... Hey! I've got it! Maybe you should face your fear and try hurling yourself off the edge? You know! One... Two... Three... Jump! It might be just what you need to get over your fear of heights!Phoenix:\n...Yeah, death is a real good way to overcome phobias alright. Anyway, it sure looks like a rickety bridge.Maya:\nCan't argue there. That's probably why it's called, \"Dusty Bridge\".Phoenix:\nRead it again, Maya. It says, \"Dusky Bridge\".Maya:\nWell, it's practically the same thing.Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCliff on opposite side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like it's about 20 yards to that cliff over there.\nMaya:\nI guess that's where I'll be training tonight. Do you want to train with me, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nAnd do the Special Course? I think not.\nMaya:\nBut it'd be so great if you had spiritual powers, too! (Really? \"I see dead people\" sounds more like a cause for alarm to me...)\n\n\n\n\nWooden sign on left side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere's a narrow path going off in a different direction than that of the Main Hall.\nMaya:\nThe sign here is so old, the text seems to have vanished.\nPhoenix:\nThe path leads to a wooden staircase that goes down to the bottom of the canyon.\nMaya:\nOK, I'll write, \"wooden staircase\" on it then.\nPhoenix:\n...Do you really think that is necessary? You'd have to be blind not to see the stairs.\nMaya:\nWell, it can't hurt. Just pass me a pencil, OK?\nPhoenix:\nGraffiti is a crime, Maya.\n\n\n\n\nBridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! Why don't we hop across the bridge. It'll be fun!\nPhoenix:\nI'm not so sure... It looks like a bunny hopping across the bridge would destroy it.\nMaya:\nOK, Nick. Then let's try to find a cute little white bunny and test your theory.\nPhoenix:\n(That right there sums up the fundamental difference between sane and insane.)\n\n\n\n\nBoulder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSome letters are engraved into a roughly cut boulder.\nMaya:\n\"D-U-S-T-Y Bridge\", huh?\nPhoenix:\nIt says, \"Dusky\"! \"Dusky Bridge\"! OK?\nMaya:\nC'mon, Nick! Take a look at that bridge and tell me it's not supposed to be \"Dusty\"! This sign is obviously wrong, and I'm gonna fix it! Now give me a pencil, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nDo I look like a pencil holder to you?\n\n\n\n\nPublic phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nI can't believe there's a public phone here. Who would ever use it?\nPhoenix:\nThe people who live here, I guess. I doubt they have any real phones there.\nMaya:\nYeah, but it took like 20 minutes to walk here from the Main Hall! ... It would've been smarter of them to build the Main Hall here, don't you think?\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe you should work on channeling someone who makes logical sense, Maya.After clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate:February 7Hazakura TempleMain HallMaya:\nTh-Th-The Main Hall... I th-think it's even c-c-c-colder in here! Achoo!Pearl:\nAh! Mr. Nick! Do you smell that? It smells like meat and gravy!Maya:\nYeah, you're right! I guess it's pot roast for tonight! Yum!Phoenix:\n...Weird. I thought they would serve something a little more... well, traditional.Maya:\nWhat are you talking about, Nick!? You think monks and nuns just sit around eating rice gruel all the time!?Pearl:\nMystic Maya is right! Ooh! I hope there's mashed potatoes, too! I love mashed potatoes!???:\nHa ha ha... What a cute little acolyte! Greetings to all of you.Phoenix:\nOh... Um, hello. (Wow, this lady makes Maya look like a 6.8/10 on the weirdness scale.)Maya:\nYour outfit... Did you come here for the Special Course, too...????:\nHa, ha, ha... Unfortunately, no. Actually, I'm...Pearl:\nAaaaaaaaaah! Y-You're...! Y-You're...! You're Ms. Elise Deauxnim!Elise:\nYes, that's right... You know of me?Pearl:\nM-M-My name... My name is Pearl Fey! I-I'm your biggest fan!Maya:\nWho is she, Nick?Phoenix:\nHmm... I see it now... Zvarri! A fortune-teller...?Pearl:\nI-I've got all your books, Ms. Deauxnim!Elise:\nHa, ha, ha... What a sweet thing to say. And please, call me Elise.Phoenix:\nUm, \"books\"...?Pearl:\nMr. Nick, don't you know anything!? Don't you even know who this is?Phoenix:\nWell, um... ...An author, maybe?Elise:\nYes, and an illustrator. ...Of picture books.Maya:\nPicture books, huh? Oh, now I get it...Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElise Deauxnim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... I'm sorry I didn't know who you are. I don't get a lot of chances to really enjoy picture books.\nElise:\nIt's alright. I take no offense to that. My books are nothing but simple stories for children.\nPearl:\nAnd really beautiful pictures too, Ms. Elise! Your books always make me feel as if my heart has been purified.\nElise:\nHa ha ha... It makes me feel very happy to hear you say that.\nPhoenix:\n(I do have to admit... She certainly seems like a kind, sensitive lady.)\nPearl:\nMs. Elise won an award last year for her book, \"The Magic Bottle\"!\nElise:\nYes... A friend of mine secretly submitted a story I had written to a publisher. They liked it so much that they asked if it was alright to make it into a book.\nPhoenix:\nWow... It must have been a really great story.\nMaya:\n...Maybe I should try to write a children's book, too. If I do, you can secretly send it to a publisher for me, Nick.\nElise:\nRecently, I've accepted a sort of... apprentice you might say.\nPhoenix:\nAn apprentice?\nElise:\nHe calls himself Laurice... Laurice Deauxnim. I believe he's off doing some landscape sketches now... On Laurice's behalf as well, I'd like to thank you for your support.\nPearl:\nOf course, Ms. Elise! Anything for you!\nElise:\nHa ha ha...\n\n\n\n\nWhy come here?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPearl:\nUm... Why did you come to Hazakura Temple, Ms. Elise? Are you here... to do some spiritual training?\nElise:\nHa ha ha... No, that's not it. I'm actually here to gather materials for a new book I'm working on.\nPearl:\nWow! I-I can't wait to read it!\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls is completely taken with her...)\nElise:\nI wanted to do a book with a more Japanese feel to it this time.\nPhoenix:\n...So is that why you're dressed like you are?\nElise:\nThe children have a certain image of me in their minds. I don't want to disappoint them...\nPhoenix:\n(What can I say... She's really a sweet lady...)\nPearl:\nWow, Ms. Elise, you're dressed up like a mountain nun!\nElise:\nYes. The good people here were kind enough to let me borrow this... I'm wearing training clothes underneath my robe, as well.\nMaya:\n...I want a staff like that.\nElise:\nYou like the crystal sphere? It's real amethyst, you know.\nMaya:\nMaybe we'll find one like that up here on this mountain. Good luck, Nick! I know you'll find me one!Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMs. Deauxnim? What do you think about this?\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Do you think Ms. Elise is a suspect?\nPhoenix:\nHuh...?\nPearl:\nYou may be Mystic Maya's special someone, but I won't let you do this to Ms. Elise!\nPhoenix:\n(A suspect? Why would I suspect her of anything? It's not like anything's happened.)\nMaya:\nIsn't it cute, Nick? Pearly's getting all overprotective of her new friend.After clearing all Talk options:Elise:\nWell, you'll have to excuse me now... I have to go help with the dinner preparations.Pearl:\nWow! You mean you're cooking dinner tonight?Elise:\nThat's right. Would you like to help too, Pearl?Pearl:\nYes, yes! I want to help with whatever I can!Phoenix:\n(Pearls looks like she just won the lottery...)Maya:\nOh, I'll help too, then...Elise:\n...No, it's fine. Please don't worry about it. Feel free to relax and explore the area with your friend.Maya:\nHuh!? But...Elise:\n...Oh, yes! Please take this. I think it will be of help to you. It's a map of the area. We wouldn't want you to get lost now, would we?Phoenix:\n(The \"Inner Temple\"... There it is, on the other side of the bridge...) Well, if you insist, I guess we'll take this chance to go check out the other temple.Hazakura Temple Map added to the Court Record.Pearl:\nOK! I'll see you two later then! Remember! You're not allowed to fight!Maya:\nCome on, Nick! Let's go! At least we'll stay warm if we keep moving!February 7Hazakura TempleMain GateMaya:\nHuh? Where did Sister Bikini go?Phoenix:\nI guess she went to the Inner Temple... To go help that other nun out.Maya:\nOh, right... I think her name is... Iris?Phoenix:\nY-Yeah... That was it. (I want to find out who Iris really is, but I'm scared of what I'll find...)Maya:\n...?February 7Inner Temple GateMaya:\nWhoa, that bridge was shaking like jello in an earthquake.Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nAnd at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I bet. (Changed from [And at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I'd bet.] in the original release)Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nNot to mention the last part only had like one board left on it!Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nWhat's wrong with you? Your face is all green.Phoenix:\nC-Can you not pick on me for a second? I'm still trying to get over the shock that we made it safely across that death trap.Maya:\nYeah, I guess I'm a bit surprised, too... Yikes! That \"temple\" is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse at any time... (Changed from [Yikes! That 'temple' is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse anytime...] in the original release)Phoenix:\nI guess people don't use it too often. Is this really where you're going to train tonight?Maya:\nThat has to be it. It's kinda creepy around here... Like a ghost might jump out at you or something!Phoenix:\n(A spirit medium afraid of ghosts...? Isn't it ironic, don't you think?)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI don't care how much you pay me, I don't want to cross that bridge again.\nMaya:\nNo worries, Nick. No one is offering you any money.\nPhoenix:\nThat's because no reasonable person would call that pile of popsicle sticks a bridge! The latter half of it was nothing more than a few planks of wood and some string!\nMaya:\nHey, if we want to get back, we've got no choice but to cross it again, you know.\nPhoenix:\n... Maybe I'll just stay... I've always dreamed of living in a little shack in the woods.\nMaya:\n...Wow, you really are scared, aren't you?\n\n\n\n\nSuspension wire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nIt looks like this bridge is suspended by 4 of these wires.\nPhoenix:\n...They're reeeally thin. Shouldn't they be just a little thicker...?\nMaya:\nOh, stop it! You're such a worrywart, Nick! If the bridge were really going to collapse... ...I'm pretty sure the boards would break before these wires ever did!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nWhat's wrong? You're turning into an over-ripe avocado again.\n\n\n\n\nBuddha statues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nOh, wow! Look at these neat Buddha statues. Maybe I'll take one home with me.\nPhoenix:\nMaya!\nMaya:\nBut there are so many. They wouldn't notice if I took just one.\nPhoenix:\nAre you kidding? Of course they'll notice! What are you gonna do with one of those anyway?\nMaya:\nPut it in the office of course! We can trade that wooden statue in the office reception area for one of these!\nPhoenix:\n(You know, come to think of it, where did that wooden statue come from anyway...?)\n\n\n\n\nIncinerator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nHey! There's a giant robot buried in the snow!\nPhoenix:\n... Well, there's something buried in the snow, but... I think it's an incinerator.\nMaya:\nOh... Hee hee. But you've gotta admit it looks a lot like a robot.\nPhoenix:\nUm, sure... Anyway, I don't think it gets used much. It's looking pretty rusty.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Do you think this Giant Robo-cinerator can walk?\nPhoenix:\nI told you! It's not a robot! ...And it's not especially big either.\nMaya:\nBah, you have no imagination. I thought it'd be real neat if you had to beat it to advance.\nPhoenix:\n(A fight between a lawyer and an overgrown furnace? Who'd ever pay to see that!?)\n\n\n\n\nYellow gate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nHey! A half-opened gate! That's practically a welcome mat!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, except the sign on here says, \"No Entry\".\nMaya:\nUmm, Nick. Rules are made to be broken, you know.\nPhoenix:\n...You expect a lawyer to go along with that?\nMaya:\nOh, come on! You're such an old lady sometimes! Let's just go!\nPhoenix:\nDon't blame it on me when Sister Bikini puts a curse on you.\nMaya:\n... Now you've got me scared. Um, let's just forget about it, OK?\n\n\n\n\nWooden log on left\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nLooks like there's something written on it.\nPhoenix:\nI can't read it, but if I had to take a good guess, I'd say it says, \"Inner Temple\".\nMaya:\nWhat's the point of a sign if you can't read it? Must be tough for the mailman when he's delivering here.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess the sign is a good indication of how long this place has been here...)\n\n\n\n\nGate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nSo that's the Inner Temple up ahead, huh?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks kinda run-down.\nMaya:\nWell, it wouldn't be very temple-like if it was all bright and shiny.\nPhoenix:\nSo you're training here tonight, huh?\nMaya:\nYup! Then everyone'll see my spiritual powers!\n...Uuurrrgh...ggnngh...ggh...\nPhoenix:\nSounds like your stomach wants to show off its digestive powers instead...\nMaya:\nI wonder if that roast is ready yet?February 7Inner TempleTraining HallPhoenix:\nMan, look at this place... It's just a tiny, freezing-cold room. So this is where you'll both be training, huh...Maya:\nHuh? What do you mean, \"both\"? I'm the only one.Phoenix:\nReally? But I thought...Maya:\nPearly's just a little kid. She couldn't handle this kind of intense training.Phoenix:\n(So says the girl who I can barely hear over her teeth chattering...) (Changed from [So says the girl who I can barely hear over her bones chattering...] in the original release)Maya:\nAnyway... The real training room must be behind that door over there. Hmm... Yup, definitely getting the feeling it's back there. (Changed from [Yeah, I get the feeling it's back there, definitely.] in the original release)Phoenix:\n(Even I can sense that there's something supernatural about the cavern behind that door...) (Changed from [If only because the cavern behind that door is giving off a real supernatural feel...] in the original release)???:\nUm... Excuse me, but... Who are you...? ...Ah! ...Phoenix:\nY-You're...Maya:\nHi there! We're just looking around since we're going to be staying here tonight...???:\n...Maya:\n...? Is something wrong????:\nUh, er, no! It-It's nothing...Maya:\nI wonder why she spaced out like that. Don't you, Nick?Phoenix:\nUh... D-Did you say something, M-Maya?Maya:\n... Not you too, Nick...Iris:\nI... M-My name is Iris. I'm one of the nuns here at this temple.Maya:\nI'm Maya Fey. It's a pleasure to meet you!Iris:\nThe pleasure is mine... ... Oh, er, please excuse me! I have some... um, chores to attend to.Maya:\nShe sure is beautiful... and a bit spacey, I guess... I guess she's just not used to talking with urban sophisticates like us.Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nNick?Phoenix:\n(That girl... It-It can't be, but...)Maya:\n...?Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDresser drawers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nLook at this antique dresser. I wonder if there's anything valuable inside. Let's have a look... Hmph... Nothing! Just a bunch of clothes. Hey, Nick.\nPhoenix:\n... Huh! Oh, sorry. I was just... thinking.\nMaya:\nOh? About Iris, I bet! Looks like you've been bitten by the love bug, Nick!\n\n\n\n\nMattresses\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere are a bunch of musty looking blankets and bedding sets piled up here. I wonder why they're even here in the first place? \nMaya:\nIt's because all spiritual training is done under the supervision of a nun. I wonder if Sister Bikini is planning to sleep in here while I train? \nPhoenix:\n(But if they sleep, what's the point of having them here in the first place...?)\n\n\n\n\nSacred cavern entrance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nThe actual training area must be on the other side of this door. I wonder what it's like. Phooey... It's locked. Come on, Nick! You know you want to open it for me!\nPhoenix:\n...I can't.\nMaya:\n... You've been in kind of a bad mood lately, haven't you, Nick? ...Zvarri! I know what it is! I-R-I-S.\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nHa ha ha ha ha! ♪Iris and Nick, sitting in a tree! K-I-S-S-I-N-G!♪\n\n\n\n\nHanging scroll\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(A hanging scroll... It doesn't look that old either...)\nMaya:\nAAAAAAH!\nPhoenix:\nAAAAAAAAACK! Wh-What is it!? Why did you scream like that!?\nMaya:\nTh-This scroll...! It-It's my mother...\nPhoenix:\nWh... Whaaaaaaaat!?\nMaya:\n...It's Misty Fey. The Master of the Kurain School of Channeling...\nPhoenix:\nAre... Are you sure?\nMaya:\nYes... The crest at the top of the scroll... That's the special mark of the Master of our tradition.\nPhoenix:\n(So that's what the mark means...)\nMaya:\n...\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it?\nMaya:\nN-Nothing... It's just that... I last saw her over 15 years ago... If it wasn't for that crest... I wouldn't have even known it was her. My own mother... And I can't even recognize her face.\nPhoenix:\nMaya...\nHanging Scroll added to the Court Record.\n\n\n\n\nHanging scroll (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's a hanging wall scroll showing Maya's mother, Misty Fey. It's not that old. That crest at the top is the official mark of the Master. I wonder if this temple has some sort of connection to \nthe Fey family...\nMaya:\nI think it does, actually. Supposedly, it was founded by a branch family member of the Kurain School.\nPhoenix:\n(I'll have to ask Bikini in more detail when I get the chance... About Maya... And the Fey family in general.)After examining hanging scroll in Inner Temple - Training Hall:February 7Dusky BridgeMaya:\nWhew, we managed to make it across Dusty Bridge.Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nNick, you look green. Are you feeling alright?Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nHey! What's wrong with you? Ever since we met Sister Iris at the Training Hall, you've been really quiet.Phoenix:\nHuh!? Oh, um. Sorry...???:\nHey, you! ...Wait up!Maya:\n...? You think he's yelling at us?Phoenix:\nHe must be. There's no one else around...???:\nWould you mind moving? You're standing right in my way. ... Ah!Maya:\nHey! I know you! You're...???:\nWhoa! Sorry! Gotta run! ...See ya!Phoenix:\nH-Hey! Wait a minute!???:\nOh, uh, nice to meet you. ...I'm Laurice Deauxnim.Phoenix:\nLiar! You're Larry! Your clothes may change, but you're still the Butz.Butz:\nShaddup! I'm... I'm... Lauriiiiice! And I'm just here to do a sketch of Dusky Bridge!Maya:\nSo... it really is our Larry. ...Not that I get why he's pretending to be someone else.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaurice Deauxnim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo what are you doing with the last name, \"Deauxnim\"?\nButz:\nWell I... I just... I wanted to start over again! With a clean slate!\nMaya:\nA clean slate...?\nButz:\nYou remember don't you? Last time?\nPhoenix:\n(The Mask☆DeMasque case...)\nButz:\nAfter that, I started to realize I didn't like this guy known as Larry Butz! And that's when I came across it... The book of destiny!\nMaya:\nThe \"book of destiny\"...? Do you mean...?\nButz:\n\"The Magic Bottle\"! By Ms. Elise Deauxnim! It's so beautiful... So moving... So... So gentle. My heart felt cleansed! I-I was saved!\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe I should buy a copy of \"The Magic Bottle\"...)\nMaya:\nWow, Larry would make a great book salesman! I really want to get that book now, too!\n\n\n\n\nElise Deauxnim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nShe's the most wonderful person I've ever met! I'd follow her anywhere!\nMaya:\nWell, she certainly is a very elegant lady.\nButz:\nYou see? You see? Here's a photo I took of her in secret!\nMaya:\nWow! That's a beautiful photo!\nButz:\nYou want a copy, don't you? It's OK... I just happened to have made extra prints!\nPhoto of Elise added to the Court Record.\n\n\n\n\nElise Deauxnim (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nShe's the most wonderful person I've ever met!

That's a beautiful photo!\n\n\n\n\nPicture books\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nStill, it's kinda hard to imagine you as a picture book illustrator... So tell the truth. You must have some kind of ulterior motive, right?\nButz:\nWh-What're you talking about!? I don't... I don't trust anyone anymore... Especially not women!\nMaya:\n...Talk about a bad case of denial.\nPhoenix:\nAnyway... Can you even draw well enough to make a picture book?\nButz:\nArt isn't only about technical skill, you know. It's also about having a pure heart!\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's why I'm asking. Can you draw well enough to make a whole book?\nButz:\n...! Hmm... Now that you mention it... I wonder.\nMaya:\nIt looks like you still have some doubt in your heart.\nButz:\nIt's true, I do... But when I first saw her, I felt it! Something inside me ended, and something else began.\nMaya:\nOh Larry, it sounds like you've fallen in love with Ms. Elise Deauxnim!\nButz:\nNo! Y-You're wrong! It's not her... It's the other girl!\nPhoenix:\n\"Other girl\"...? Uh oh... (I got a bad feeling about this...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nWow! You're even cuter than the last time I saw you.\nMaya:\nOh, really!?\nButz:\nYeah, you look like a totally different person! Don't you think so, Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe it's 'cause we're always together, but she looks pretty much the same to me.)\n\n\n\n\nMia Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nHey, I remember her! That's Maya's big sister!\nMaya:\nWow! You really do remember!\nButz:\nYeah, who could forget! A couple of gorgeous sisters! Hubba hubba!\nMaya:\nYou hear that, Nick! Gorgeous!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh yeah... That's right. When I defended Larry... Mia was still alive...)\n\n\n\n\nPearl Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nI haven't seen her in a while, so I bet she's gotten a lot bigger.\nPhoenix:\nWell, it's only been 5 months since we celebrated Ron's non-guilty verdict.\nButz:\nMaybe so, but kids these days grow up so fast.\nPhoenix:\n...She hasn't changed a bit as far as I can tell.\nButz:\nCome on, Nick... I really doubt that. You just don't know 'cause you don't pay enough attention, that's all.\nPhoenix:\n(Sometimes I really worry about what goes on inside this guy's head...)\n\n\n\n\nBikini profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nShe seems really motherly, doesn't she?\nButz:\nWhat do you mean \"seems\" motherly?

She's like a mother to me.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, you can tell from the kindness reflected in her eyes.\nButz:\nWhen I first looked into her eyes, I just couldn't help it. I started blabbing about all the bad things I had done in my life. She just laughed that gentle laugh of hers and listened!\nPhoenix:\n(Are you sure she wasn't just laughing at you...?)\n\n\n\n\nIris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nWhoo yeah! Her! My little Iris!\nMaya:\nShe's really pretty.\nButz:\nThis girl... She's perfect! She's exactly my type! I wonder if she would model for me. I want to draw a portrait of her.\nMaya:\nYeah, you always liked those model types, didn't you Larry? ...Hey, wait a sec! Didn't you say you were swearing off women...?\nButz:\nHuh!? Yeah, that's right. Of course I have! I have... basically. But...\nMaya:\n\"But\"...?\nButz:\nBut... Iris is different. I feel like... I feel like I still have one chance left at the dream...\nPhoenix:\n(This guy will never change.)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nHey, I know I may not look like it, but I'm an artist.

Pearly!Pearl:\nDinner preparations are complete! Please come quickly to the Main Hall!Maya:\nAlright! I can't wait to dig in, Pearly!Pearl:\nI'm going to go to the Inner Temple and call Sister Iris! I also want to have a look at where Mystic Maya is going to be training...February 7, 7:46 PMHazakura TempleMain HallMaya:\nBoy am I stuffed...Phoenix:\nAre you sure it's alright to eat that much before your training?Maya:\nWell, this kind of training is a battle of endurance.Pearl:\nMystic Maya... Please don't do anything that might put your health at risk.Maya:\nHa ha ha. No pain, no gain, I guess.Pearl:\nNngh... I'm still worried about you...Bikini:\nWell, well, well. Let's not dilly-dally shilly-shally. You must get ready for tonight.Elise:\nGood luck. ...Maya.Maya:\nAlright! Here I go! I'll see you all tomorrow, I guess!Bikini:\nIris, please ring the bell at 10:00 for lights out, alright?Iris:\nYes, Sister Bikini.Bikini:\nAnd then, after you ring the bell, I want you to come join us at the Training Hall.Iris:\nI understand, Sister Bikini.Phoenix:\n(Maya and Bikini really seem excited about this training thing tonight...)Elise:\n...Well, Pearl? What are you going to do tonight?Pearl:\nWell, umm...Elise:\nIf you'd like, you can come to my room. Perhaps we can read some books together.Pearl:\nR-Really!? I'd love to! I, umm... I'm not very good at reading.Elise:\nHa ha ha. Well then, would you like to practice reading with me?Pearl:\nAh! I'd love to!Phoenix:\n(Pearls is absolutely smitten with Ms. Deauxnim...) So Larry, what are you going to do?Butz:\nHuh... Me? Um, well... I'm just gonna hang out in my room. I can't stand the cold at all.Phoenix:\n(I totally hear you there.)Pearl:\nUm, Ms. Elise? So, for example, how do you read this?Elise:\nIt says, \"gravely\"... That's kind of a tough word.Pearl:\nOh! OK! And what about this word?Elise:\nThat's another tough one. It says, \"roast\".Phoenix:\n(What kind of a book is she reading anyway...?)Pearl:\nWell, I'm going to go wash the dishes and help clean up. I'll go visit you when I'm done, Ms. Elise!Phoenix:\n(Well, not much to do except head to my room and huddle under the covers, I guess...)February 7, 9:12 PMHazakura TempleMain HallPhoenix:\n(Ugh... It's a whole different type of cold up here in the mountains! Argh... Why couldn't the nearest bathroom be just a little closer to my room...?)???:\n...Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nYaaaaaaah! Oh! Ah, Ms. Deauxnim! Are you going to use the bathroom, too?Elise:\nUm, no. But... Have you seen Pearl?Phoenix:\nNo... Not since after dinner. I thought she said she was going to go to your room...Elise:\nI know... But she never showed up. I-I'm going to go look for her. ...Excuse me.Phoenix:\n(Ms. Elise Deauxnim... A woman as mysterious in origin as her last name... But... The really mysterious one is...)Iris:\nOh...Phoenix:\nAh...! S-Sister Iris...!Iris:\nG... G-Good evening...Phoenix:\n(The real mysterious one is this girl...!)Iris:\nUm, are you on your way to the bathroom too, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n(...I can't let this chance pass me by! I should try to talk with her... And maybe get some answers.)Move\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n...It's freezing cold out there. And dark, too.

You're Sister Iris, right?\nIris:\n...Yes.\nPhoenix:\nS-So... um, when did you come to Hazakura Temple?\nIris:\n... I don't remember. Ever since I was a small child, the temple has been my home.\nPhoenix:\nSo you've never left?\nIris:\nWell, I don't have any family left to take care of me... Sister Bikini... I've come to think of her as my real mother, as it were.\nPhoenix:\nAh, I see... But you... Didn't you go to college? ...And maybe enroll with the Ivy University Literature Department?\nIris:\nNo, I never had an interest in going to a big university like that... My training is all the education I need.\nPhoenix:\nI... I see...\nIris:\nBut... Once in a while, when I get the chance, I make a trip to the nearby town. I can use a computer and a cell phone, too.\nPhoenix:\n... (That's not exactly something worth bragging about... But I don't see any Psyche-Locks... ...so I guess that means she's not lying...)\nIris:\nP-Please don't stare at me like that...\n\n\n\n\nHazakura Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of a place is this anyway? I heard it's for training to increase your spiritual power or something like that.\nIris:\nIt must seem awfully crazy to normal people like you.\nPhoenix:\nWell, I have to admit it is a whole different world up here...\nIris:\nI'm glad to hear you say that.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nIris:\nTalking with dead people... Who does it help anyway? ...I hate it.\nPhoenix:\nR-Really?

I have to go and ring the bell for lights out...Phoenix:\n(I guess it's almost 10:00 now, huh?)Iris:\n... Um... Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n...Yes?Iris:\nIf it's alright with you... I would like you to have this.Phoenix:\nBut this is your hood...Iris:\nIt has the power to protect you from evil spirits.Phoenix:\n(Come to think of it, Sister Bikini was wearing one of these, too...)Iris:\nI pray for your safety on this dark, cold night.Iris's Hood received from Iris.Iris:\nI'm sorry, but I must bid you goodnight.Phoenix:\nWait a minute, Sister Iris...Iris:\nY-Yes...?Phoenix:\nJust now, you called me by my name... You said, \"Mr. Wright\". How did you know my name? I never introduced myself to you.Iris:\nTh-That's...Phoenix:\n...Sister Iris. Please, tell me the truth. You and I...

Maya... and Iris's Bikini... ...Huh? Say something, Edgey!Edgeworth:\n...Before I came here, I stopped in at the hospital where Wright is. I believe I have a better understanding of the situation than you, at this point. The murder victim was the picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. She was found by Wright and the head nun. The suspect is the temple's younger nun. Then later, while Wright was crossing the bridge, it broke and he fell into the river. The hospital says that he'll need at least 2 days of bed rest.Butz:\nY-Yes! Th-That's right! You got it! B-But they arrested her... My sweet little Iris!Edgeworth:\n(And here I was, convinced HE was the one the police had arrested...) However... I still don't understand what these two items are for.Butz:\nWhat are you talking about?Edgeworth:\nThey're things Wright gave to me when I was leaving his room. (This is the first... He said some nonsense about being able to see into people's hearts with this... And the other... He couldn't possibly be asking what I think he is... could he?)Butz:\nI'm begging you! Iris's trial starts tomorrow! With Nick out of the picture, you're all I've got left! You're the only one that can represent her!Edgeworth:\n... What did you just say?Butz:\nYou know! REPRESENT! DEFEND! What were you expecting!? Why do you think I called you anyway!?Edgeworth:\n...I'm a prosecutor, Larry. A prosecutor. Do YOU understand what I'm saying? A prosecutor is a lawyer who...Butz:\nDon't talk to me like a kid! I graduated from junior high, you know! Don't worry about it! I promise I won't tell!Edgeworth:\nBut I...Butz:\nI mean, I heard a paper badge had no problem fooling an entire court before!Edgeworth:\n(...How could this country's judicial system have fallen into such decay!?)Butz:\nPlease, Edgey! At least listen to her... Listen to Iris's side of the story!Edgeworth:\n(So Wright wasn't joking when he gave me this badge after all...)Iris:\nThank you for coming. ...My name is Iris.Edgeworth:\n...Edgeworth.

Mr. Laurice said that he... That he might even die...Edgeworth:\n... Fortunately, he will be fine. (Larry, you moron! How could you say something like that!?) He was badly bruised when he hit the water, but otherwise he is unharmed.Iris:\n... Thank goodness...Edgeworth:\nBut, he's caught some kind of nasty cold.Iris:\nA cold...?Edgeworth:\nHe's running a high fever and is drifting in and out of consciousness.Iris:\n...Edgeworth:\n(I must be imagining things.

What's that?\nIris:\nIt's a place where those who wish to boost their spiritual power come to train. You need to undergo some very difficult training to release your inner spiritual power.\nEdgeworth:\nSpiritual power...? Did you go to that temple for that reason as well?\nIris:\nNo... I don't have any spiritual powers. I don't need them.\nEdgeworth:\nIn that case, what are you doing at that temple then?\nIris:\n... I... I've committed some sins. Sins that I need to pay for. That's why I'm there, and why I continue to train... To purify my soul.\n\n\n\n\nThe night of the crime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI want to ask you about last night... The night of the crime.\nIris:\nAlright... I helped to clean up after dinner, and then went back to my room at about 8:00. Later, I left my room to ring the lights out bell at 10:00.\nEdgeworth:\nBell...?\nIris:\n...We ring it at the same time each night.\nEdgeworth:\nI see... And then?\nIris:\nA-And then...\nEdgeworth:\n...?\nIris:\nI was told to go to the Training Hall, but... I went back to my room... and stayed there...\nEdgeworth:\nWhy didn't you go to the Training Hall like you were asked to?\nIris:\n...I-I was frightened.\nEdgeworth:\n(\"Frightened\"...?)\nIris:\nSo I just stayed in my room and meditated... until the murder happened.\nEdgeworth:\n(There's more to her story.  I just know there is. Maybe  I should dig a little deeper.)\n\n\n\n\nFrightened? (appears after \"The night of the crime\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou were asked to go to the Training Hall on the night of the murder?\nIris:\nYes...\nEdgeworth:\nHowever... You didn't go. Because you say you were frightened. What exactly were you so frightened of?\nIris:\n...!\n\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Wh-What in the world!?)\nIris:\nUm... Is there something wrong?\nEdgeworth:\n...I'm sorry. It's nothing. (It looks like she's not aware of them herself... These must be what Wright was talking about... The \"Psycholocks\"! I believe he said that I need to present this \"Magatama\" item to do something...)\nIris:\n...?\n\n\n\n\nFrightened? (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nI... I don't like to walk alone at night. And, last night was...\nEdgeworth:\nWhat about last night?\n\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n\nIris:\nEr, oh... nothing. It's rather silly...\nEdgeworth:\nSo there was something special about last night, hmm?\nIris:\nNngh...\nEdgeworth:\n(It looks like I have no choice but to break these locks...)\n\n\n\n\nAny idea? (before clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night?\nIris:\n...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed.\nEdgeworth:\nSpiritual power...?\nIris:\nYes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example...\nEdgeworth:\n...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science. I don't believe in \"spiritual power\".\nIris:\nYes... I understand. Most people don't.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd I am certain that the thing that killed the victim was a human. So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim?\nIris:\n... No. I'm not the one who took her life.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... (That was foolish of me... It's not as if I can know for certain if she is telling me the truth...)\n\n\n\n\nAny idea? (after clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night?\nIris:\n...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed.\nEdgeworth:\nSpiritual power...?\nIris:\nYes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example...\nEdgeworth:\n...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science.

So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim?\nIris:\n... No. I'm not the one who took her life.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... (Those Psycholock things aren't appearing... I suppose that means I can believe that she's not lying.) ...Heh.\nIris:\nWhat's wrong?\nEdgeworth:\n(I can't believe what I'm thinking... And here I just finished saying that I don't believe in spiritual power...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nIs that an attorney's badge?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, this belongs to Wright.\nIris:\nReally?\nEdgeworth:\nI'm actually a prosecutor.\nIris:\nOh...! Then why do you have a defense attorney's badge pinned on your lapel...?\nEdgeworth:\nWell, you see... I, um... I borrowed it.\n\n\n\n\nHanging Scroll\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWho is the woman on this hanging scroll?\nIris:\nWell, I don't know the details, but... I've heard she's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique.\nEdgeworth:\nM-Master?\nIris:\nYes. Mystic Misty. She was a great spirit medium. ...That's what I've heard. I also heard that she went missing over 15 years ago.\nEdgeworth:\n... Spirit mediums... There's no such thing anyway...\nIris:\nMr. Edgeworth...?\nEdgeworth:\nI know all about them... They're nothing but frauds!\nIris:\n...?\nEdgeworth:\n(She doesn't know anything about it, of course... But there was a time, 17 years ago, when I met the \"Master\" myself...)\n\n\n\n\nIris's Hood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nThat's called a \"Demon-Warding Hood\". ...I gave that to Mr. Wright last night.\nEdgeworth:\nHe was wearing this when I saw him at the hospital today.\nIris:\nIt's an important item for protecting acolytes from evil spirits.\nEdgeworth:\nIf it's so important, then why did you give it to him?\nIris:\nLast night... I felt... something... I felt that something terrible was about to happen... I... I didn't want Mr. Wright to fall into its grip.\nEdgeworth:\n(Well he wound up falling into something much deeper and colder... I probably shouldn't say that out loud, though. Thank god for inner monologue.)\n\n\n\n\n\"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\n...I was against the idea of our temple appearing in that magazine. I was afraid that... this type of a tragedy might occur.\nEdgeworth:\nIn that case, why did you allow them to run an article about you?\nIris:\nIt was Sister Bikini... She's actually rather fond of attention... Surprisingly so.\nEdgeworth:\n(She certainly does look rather happy in this photo...)\n\n\n\n\nPhoto of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nThat's Mystic Elise Deauxnim. She's a picture book author, or so I've heard.\nEdgeworth:\nDoes she come to Hazakura Temple often...?\nIris:\nNo... This was her first time. It's just that...\nEdgeworth:\n...?\nIris:\nShe was a very important visitor.\nEdgeworth:\nIs that so?\nIris:\nYes, Sister Bikini told me, \"Be certain not to offend her.\"\nEdgeworth:\n(The victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim... The prosecutor's office still doesn't have much information about her it seems...)\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix Wright profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nMr. Wright... How bad is his cold?\nEdgeworth:\nWell his fever is very high. As a result, he's rather confused. He's worried about Maya, who is still trapped in the Inner Temple... ...And he's quite worried about you as well, it seems.\nIris:\n...Really?\nEdgeworth:\nYes... Naturally, once he recovers, I'll pass the baton back to him.\nIris:\nNo... Don't... I'm sure that Mr. Wright wouldn't want that... He wouldn't want to defend me.\n\n\n\n\nLarry Butz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nOh... That's Mr. Laurice.\nEdgeworth:\n...I'm sorry? Who did you say it was?\nIris:\nLaurice Deauxnim. He is Mystic Elise's apprentice, I think.\nEdgeworth:\n(Alright... Now who exactly is this guy...?)\nIris:\nHe's a very sincere, hard-working person.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nIris:\nUm... Did I say something wrong, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nE-Excuse me. I was temporarily at a loss for words. (Take a trip... Come home... Be thrust suddenly into bizarro world...)\n\n\n\n\nIris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nYou want to know about me? There's not much to tell, I'm afraid.\nEdgeworth:\nJust let me get one thing straight. You were raised at Hazakura Temple, correct? And yet, somehow, you seem to know Wright.\nIris:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nSo you two must have crossed paths somewhere.\nIris:\n...No, Mr. Edgeworth. Whomever it was... ...it couldn't have been me.\nEdgeworth:\n(What is that supposed to mean?)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nI'm sorry... I don't leave the temple grounds very often... So I don't know very much about the outside world.After clearing all Talk options:Edgeworth:\nHmm... It appears that's about all that you can tell me.Iris:\nThank you very much for listening to my story.Edgeworth:\n...I visited Wright at the hospital before coming here. He asked me to take care of you...Iris:\n...M-Me?Edgeworth:\nYes, at the trial tomorrow... He asked me to defend you.Iris:\n... If Mr. Wright has that much faith in you, Mr. Edgeworth... ...Then I will gladly entrust my fate in your capable hands.Edgeworth:\nBut before that, I have one question.Iris:\nYes?Edgeworth:\nDo you know Wright?Iris:\nEr... Wh-Why would you ask that?Edgeworth:\nWhenever you came up in our conversation, he would begin to act a little... strange.Iris:\n... Mr. Edgeworth... What is Mr. Wright to you? (Changed from [Mr. Edgeworth... Are you his friend?] in the original release)Edgeworth:\n...He is a very dear and indispensable friend. (Changed from [Friend? Well... In a sense, yes.] in the original release)Iris:\n... It was 5 years ago... That's when I... That's when I... deceived him.Edgeworth:\nYou \"deceived\" him...?Iris:\nI heard that he was... in a lot of pain after what happened. I know what a weak person I am. That's why... That's why I thought it was best if he never saw me again. I wanted him to just forget about me, without learning the truth.Edgeworth:\n... Well, if you ask me, Wright is still suffering... And until he learns the truth, I don't think he will ever be able to truly recover. ...Iris. It's not too late. You should go to him. ...Tell him the truth.Iris:\n...Edgeworth:\nI'll defend you, but only if you agree to that one condition.Iris:\n... Alright, Mr. Edgeworth... I promise.Edgeworth:\n...Very well. I'll do everything in my power to get you an acquittal. (That's enough information gathering for now. I should head to the crime scene...)February 8Dusky BridgeEdgeworth:\n(It sure is cold alright... So this is it... Dusky Bridge...)???:\nOh, wow! It's you, Mr. Edgeworth! (Changed from [Ahem! M-Mr. Edgeworth!] in the original release)Edgeworth:\nNngh... Detective Gumshoe. (Changed from [Urk... Detective Gumshoe.] in the original release)Gumshoe:\nLong time no see! It's been about a year? ...Or has it been longer?Edgeworth:\nIt doesn't matter, Detective. What does matter is why you're shuffling around up here.Gumshoe:\nOh, ouch! ...And there's that sharp left jab! (Changed from [Oh, ouch! ...And there was a sharp left jab!] in the original release) Well, I'm happy to see you anyway, Mr. Edgeworth!Edgeworth:\nLet me guess... You were transferred by HR to the local precinct? (Changed from [Let me guess... You were transferred into another section at work.] in the original release) A wise decision. The vast amount of nothing up here should be quite easy to guard. (Changed from [A good choice. The vast amount of nothing up here must be quite easy to guard.] in the original release)Gumshoe:\nI heard you were back in the country and arranged to come all the way out here! Everybody was real nice. They even let me take charge of the investigation, sir.Edgeworth:\n(...Gumshoe indeed! Like gum on your shoe, he's impossible to get rid of!)Gumshoe:\nI'm supposed to report on the details of the crime scene, sir! Anyway! Here I am! Detective Dick Gumshoe! Reporting for duty!Edgeworth:\n...Great. Um, thank you, Detective.Gumshoe:\nI thought Prosecutor Godot was gonna get here before me. That guy's a real mystery, I tell you!Edgeworth:\n(...Prosecutor Godot?)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCliff on other side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt looks like a pretty good distance to that far cliff.\nGumshoe:\nYeah... It's gotta be around 100 yards or so.\nEdgeworth:\n... Detective... That's not even CLOSE to a hundred yards.\nGumshoe:\nWell... I gotta admit I'm not very good at judging distances.\nEdgeworth:\n(It's about 20 yards or so. And impossible to cross without a bridge, it seems...)\n\n\n\n\nWooden sign on left side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThere's a little shack down that way called, \"Heavenly Hall\".\nEdgeworth:\nA shack...?\nGumshoe:\nIt's like a run-down doghouse for losers that can't bear the freezing drafts of wind... Kinda reminds me of my apartment, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nThe name \"Heavenly Hall\" makes it sound like a palace...\nGumshoe:\nGiving a hovel a great name is a crime itself! I'd call it false advertising! By the way, the name of my apartment complex is \"Compton Castles\"...\nEdgeworth:\n...That's not such a great name, if you ask me.\nGumshoe:\nWell, it's not such a great apartment either, sir.\n\n\n\n\nBridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo this is the bridge Wright tried to cross?\nGumshoe:\nPretty reckless, if you ask me.\nEdgeworth:\nI'm amazed he survived the fall from up here...\nGumshoe:\nYeah, he's one lucky guy, sir. Now I see how he manages to win his cases in court. Blind luck.\nEdgeworth:\n(I think dumb luck suits Wright just a bit better.)\n\n\n\n\nBoulder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSome letters are wildly engraved into a roughly cut boulder. \"Dusky Bridge\"... It certainly is an appropriate name.\nGumshoe:\nYou need to get some glasses, Mr. Edgeworth! That sign says, \"Dusty Bridge\". I can see how you read it wrong, though, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nYou're the one who needs glasses, Detective. Try reading it one more time.\nGumshoe:\n... Ah! You're right! It's \"Dusky Bridge\" after all! ... I guess whoever wrote this made a mistake!\n\n\n\n\nPublic phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nHey! It's a public phone! You don't see a lot of these anymore!\nEdgeworth:\n...That's true.\nGumshoe:\nSince we've got one here, why don't we take a photo as a memento!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, um, sure. Why not?\nGumshoe:\nOh, darn it! I don't have a camera with me! ...I'm gonna go buy a disposable camera! I'll be right back, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n(What's so special about public phones, and why is he so fascinated by them...?)Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened (before visitng Main Hall)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case...\nGumshoe:\nIt's simple!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, simple is as simple does, as they say.\nGumshoe:\nOh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing!\nEdgeworth:\nA witness...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that Bikini lady.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Bikini lady\"? Here? On this freezing cold mountain?\nGumshoe:\n...Well, you should talk to her yourself if you want the details, sir.\nEdgeworth:\n(I may have to talk to this \"bikini lady\"... I mean, \"decisive witness\" myself...)\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened (after visitng Main Hall)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case...\nGumshoe:\nIt's simple!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, simple is as simple does, as they say.\nGumshoe:\nOh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing!\nEdgeworth:\nA witness...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that Bikini lady.\n\n\n\n\nDusky Bridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo this is the bridge that Wright fell through?\nGumshoe:\nYup! I can't imagine being that reckless myself... \"Look before you cross,\" is how it goes, right? Or was that \"leap\"...?\nEdgeworth:\nAnd? Is there something on the other side?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, some old building they call the Inner Temple... But we can't get over there without a bridge, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat...?\nGumshoe:\nNobody lives there, so it's usually not a problem... But someone was at the Inner Temple doing some training and now they're stuck there.\nEdgeworth:\nYes, I heard that from Wright. It's Maya Fey.\nGumshoe:\nOh no... Her again...? Anyway, the air's really turbulent right now so we can't do an aerial extraction. No one's gonna be able to reach the Inner Temple until tomorrow, sir.\nEdgeworth:\n(Will she be alright in this cold...?) So how did this bridge burn down anyway?\nGumshoe:\nWe're almost 100% sure it was lightning.\nEdgeworth:\n...Lightning?\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor Godot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo who is this Prosecutor Godot? I've never heard of him.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, he's a new guy... Showed up after you left the country! He's a complete rookie, but nobody can say a bad word about the guy.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat kind of a man is he?\nGumshoe:\nHe just became a prosecutor recently, but he's good, sir. Real good.\nEdgeworth:\n(If he's so good, how is it that I've never heard of him...?) Is he the lead prosecutor on this case?\nGumshoe:\nYou bet he is! After all, \"you know who\" is right in the middle of it.\nEdgeworth:\n\"You know who\"?\nGumshoe:\nPhoenix Wright, of course! For some reason, Godot has really got it in for Mr. Wright!\nEdgeworth:\nOh?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, he seems to have some kind of a grudge.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd what would be the cause of this grudge...?\nGumshoe:\nI dunno... Maybe he made fun of his mask or something.\nEdgeworth:\n(None of this is making any sense. I'd better look into this Godot myself.)\n\n\n\n\nLightning (appears after \"Dusky Bridge\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning?\nGumshoe:\nYup. Last night it snowed for the first time in 3 days. It's a little unusual for lightning to occur during a snow fall like that... But according to the weather data, lightning definitely struck.\nWeather Data added to the Court Record.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm, I see... This is a very detailed weather report... Almost too detailed... It even has the exact time that the lightning struck the bridge...\nGumshoe:\nOh, that? We got that information from the witness's testimony.\nEdgeworth:\nSomeone actually saw the lightning hit the bridge? Who is this witness?\nGumshoe:\n... Sorry. I'll go ask one of the local cops later, sir.\n\n\n\n\nLightning (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning?\nGumshoe:\nYup.

What's that thing doing on your lapel, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n...Is it really that odd?\nGumshoe:\nYou bet it is, sir! A prosecutor wearing a defense attorney's badge? That's like a detective with a license to kill!\nEdgeworth:\n(Does this little thing hold that ominous of a meaning...?)\n\n\n\n\nMagatama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHave you ever seen this thing before...?\nGumshoe:\nHey, thanks a lot. I was getting kind of hungry! ...*chomp!*\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What are you doing, Detective!?\nGumshoe:\nAck! ...I thought it was some kind of candy that would fill me up, sir. Lately I've been feeling so hungry all the time...\nEdgeworth:\n(Nngh... Maybe his salary has been cut just a little too much...?)\n\n\n\n\nPhoto of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThere's a lot we don't know about this victim... We don't know her real name, her background... We don't know anything really.\nEdgeworth:\nThat's rather odd... If she was trying to hide her identity, why would she become an author?\nGumshoe:\nI'll bet it was just one of those things. You know... She probably never expected to get so popular.\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix Wright profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nWhenever something happens, this guy always shows up like he hasn't got a care. In fact, you know what...? Every time he shows up, I always wonder the same thing. \"Maybe somehow he's actually the cause of all these incidents!\"\nEdgeworth:\n(I wonder if Gumshoe has realized it yet... But you could say the exact the same thing about him!)\n\n\n\n\nDick Gumshoe profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYour face is more drawn out than the last time I saw you over a year ago.\nGumshoe:\nR-Really? I thought so!\nEdgeworth:\nNo, wait... It's not so much \"drawn out\", as \"weary and tired\", or maybe just plain old \"thin\".\nGumshoe:\nI thought that too, sir. My salary's been kinda on the low end... So yeah, my food options have been kinda non-existent. Off-brand chicken soup, off-brand spaghetti, off-brand bread... That sort of stuff.\nEdgeworth:\nI thought you were really into instant noodles last year...?\nGumshoe:\n...I got really sick of the stuff after a while, sir.\n\n\n\n\nLarry Butz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nHe's supposed to be Ms. Elise Deauxnim's apprentice or something.\nEdgeworth:\n...I see.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, he drew a nice portrait of me.\nEdgeworth:\n...That's nice.\nGumshoe:\nBut he made me pay him 50 cents for it.\nEdgeworth:\n...I'm sorry about that.\nGumshoe:\n... You don't seem very interested in him, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\n...I really don't want to talk about him. That's why.\n\n\n\n\nIris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI feel like I've seen this girl somewhere before! She wasn't from a prior case, was she?\nGumshoe:\nNope, can't be. We did a database search with her fingerprints and came up with nothing.\nEdgeworth:\nI see... (I just can't shake this nagging feeling...)\nGumshoe:\nWell, everyone knows that you are quite popular with the ladies, sir... Maybe she's an old girlfriend that you sent to Dumpsville when you were younger.\nEdgeworth:\nD-Detective! Where did you hear such nonsense from!?\nGumshoe:\nI didn't hear it from anyone. It's just sorta how I imagine you to be... sir.\nEdgeworth:\n(...D-Do I really inspire this sort of frothing desire from the female masses?)\n\n\n\n\nGodot profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI usually hear about promising young prosecutor candidates while they're still in school. But I've never seen or heard of this person.\nGumshoe:\nI gotta admit... He's puzzling alright. He just appeared one day, big mug of steaming coffee in his hand...\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... He sounds like an interesting man...\nGumshoe:\nYeah... The whole prosecutor's office is really into double espresso macchiatos lately.\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nLook, I'm just your everyday, simple detective. Don't ask me such tough questions, OK?\nEdgeworth:\n...That's not something to be proud of, Detective!February 8Detention CenterVisitor's RoomEdgeworth:\n(It looks like Iris is being interrogated right now.) ...This place certainly brings back memories.Gumshoe:\nOh yeah. Come to think of it, you got thrown in here once too, didn't you, sir? But you know what? I've never been in jail a single time!Edgeworth:\n(I should think it's hard to land in jail when you're so harmless...) Yes, well... If you're in jail, you don't have to pay for your own meals, you know.Gumshoe:\n...*gasp!* ...Edgeworth:\nDon't get any funny ideas, Detective...!Gumshoe:\n...Too late, I already did.Edgeworth:\n(In any case... I guess I'll have to come back here later...)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurveillance camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThat camera is meant to monitor everything that happens in here. And right now, it's pointed straight at the guard.\n\n\n\n\nGuard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe guard is staring at me with a puzzled expression on his face. Me... and the badge on my lapel. ...I get the feeling he recognizes me.February 8Hazakura TempleMain GateButz:\nYo! Edgey! What took you so long!? I'm so cold, my brain's turned to sherbet.Edgeworth:\n...I knew it was a mistake to race back to this country.Butz:\nWh-What do you mean...?Edgeworth:\nWright is going to be fine, and the case itself isn't anything unusual... And I find myself taking a request to defend a woman accused of murder!Gumshoe:\n...H-Hey! Wait a sec! Hold it! Objection! What's going on here, Mr. Edgeworth!?Edgeworth:\nUm, it's hard to explain, but one thing led to another and...Butz:\nWhat kind of lame excuse is that!? And you call yourself a defense attorney!?Gumshoe:\nProsecutor Edgeworth is a prosecutor, and that's why he's Prosecutor Edgeworth! \"Prosecutor Edgeworth, Defense Attorney\" just sounds plain old weird, pal! ...Right, Prosecutor Edgeworth!?Edgeworth:\n(...I'm not sure what role I'm supposed to be playing anymore.)Butz:\nHmph!

I just know it, OK!? So trust me on this one!Edgeworth:\nEver the romantic, aren't you, Larry? Nevertheless, I'll do whatever I can to prove her innocence.

You got a real flair for words, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nI have always appreciated this kind of old, timeless elegance.\nGumshoe:\nThat's exactly how I feel, too! Take this coat for example! Like a fine wine, it gets better with age!\nEdgeworth:\nEven fine wine turns to vinegar and begins to stink at some point. ...I suggest you wash that atrocious rag you call a coat, Detective.\n\n\n\n\nMain Hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThat must be the Main Hall back there.\nGumshoe:\nA brilliant deduction, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n............ Are you trying to flatter me, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nUmm... A brilliant use of suspense to build the tension, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n(According to Wright, the head nun has some important information. I can't miss the opportunity to speak with her...)\n\n\n\n\nBell tower\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI can see a small bell tower from here.\nGumshoe:\nHey, that just reminded me! There's something I've always wondered about...\nEdgeworth:\n(Something tells me he's going to tell me what's on his mind, whether I like it or not...)\nGumshoe:\nWe call a person who tells a lie a \"liar\", right? So why don't we call a person who rings a bell a \"beller\"? Or \"truer\" for a guy who tells the truth! Oh man, I'm not gonna get any sleep tonight!\nEdgeworth:\n(I had no idea he was such a deep thinker...)\n\n\n\n\nSnowmobile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI suppose this type of thing is necessary up here in the mountains.\nGumshoe:\nSay, this just gave me a great idea!\nEdgeworth:\n(Something tells me he's going to tell me what's on his mind, whether I like it or not...)\nGumshoe:\nI've got an idea for a brand new invention! It might even make me rich!\nEdgeworth:\nAn invention...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah! A car that can travel on snow! I'll call it a \"Snow Car\"!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nGumshoe:\nSo what do you think, sir? Would you go for a ride on something like that?\nEdgeworth:\n...Only after you take the first 1000 test rides.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nMan, I'm telling you. Iris is so cute! Right, Edgey? You think so too, don't you?\nEdgeworth:\n...\nButz:\nWhat's wrong? Why are you so quiet?\nEdgeworth:\nTo put it simply...Your comment has me highly concerned. Could it be that the reason you think she's innocent...\nButz:\nCome on! A girl that cute can't possibly be a murderer!\nEdgeworth:\n... ...I was right after all. I should never have come back.\nButz:\nNo, no! Don't worry! I see things for how they really are this time! Honest!\nEdgeworth:\n(If I had a penny for every time he's said that...)\nButz:\nIt's just that... Well, Iris is a delicate flower. You can't force things too much. Know what I mean?\nEdgeworth:\nHuh...? I have no idea what you're talking about, Larry.\nButz:\nOh. ...Ah! Err. Forget it.

I'm just a 25 year old jobless bum trying to be an apprentice artist!\nEdgeworth:\n(If that's what you think, then get a job already!)\nButz:\nD-Don't look at me like that! I thought we were pals!\n\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n\nEdgeworth:\nIf we're friends then I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't hide the truth from me!\nButz:\nHmph, well... Sure... It's like, you know!

After all, I saved his life.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is that supposed to mean?\nButz:\nIf I hadn't called for help so quickly, he would have died. It's no surprise though. I used to be a security guard. It was all instinct, baby!\nEdgeworth:\n(He has a point... He called me pretty quickly, too... I think Larry's pretty good at motivating people. I just wish he would try motivating himself once in a while!)\n\n\n\n\nLarry Butz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nHuh? Me?

You were a guy once! Lots of girls are like Iris. You know I'm right!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, you most certainly seem to have convinced yourself!\nButz:\nMan, I love shy girls like her!

A handsome boy such as yourself is always welcome! *sigh* If circumstances weren't so tragic, I might just...Edgeworth:\n(Please don't call me \"boy\".) I'm sorry to trouble you... But I'm looking for a woman in a bikini.Bikini:\nWell, you have found her. Now, what can I do for you?Edgeworth:\n... I'm sorry, but I don't see any bikinis...Bikini:\nHa ha ha! If you ask nicely, I might give you a peek, big boy. Wa ha ha ho ho ho!Gumshoe:\nUmm... Mr. Edgeworth? This is the head nun, Sister Bikini... She's the witness.Edgeworth:\n... Why didn't you tell me that earlier!? This is exactly why your salary keeps on getting cut!Gumshoe:\nNngh... My stomach is already growling in protest...Bikini:\nSo... Um... What's the latest about my beloved Iris!?Edgeworth:\nWell, first... I want to hear what you know.Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWalls or sliding doors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere's flowing script written everywhere on the walls.\nGumshoe:\nMan, I'd bet you'd have awful nightmares if you tried to sleep in here.\nBikini:\nThis is our Main Hall, so it's protected by a variety of magic spells and charms... They're all designed to prevent evil forces from entering.\nGumshoe:\nSo if I slept here the uggie-woogie-boogieman wouldn't hunt me down for eternity? Alright!\nEdgeworth:\n(Does this guy think about anything other than eating and sleeping...?)\n\n\n\n\nObjects on floor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nOh! It's a warmed cat box! But where are all the cats?\nEdgeworth:\n...It's called a \"hibachi\". It's for heating the room.\nGumshoe:\nOh! Look at all these ancient straw frisbees!\nEdgeworth:\nThose are a type of \"zabuton\" cushions called \"enza\"!\nGumshoe:\n... Why are you giving me such a hard time? Huh, Mr. Edgeworth? Why?\nEdgeworth:\nBecause learning something new might actually be a good thing for you, Detective!\n\n\n\n\nAltar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt's an altar with a giant Magatama enshrined on it.\nGumshoe:\nThere are lots of candles lined up on it, too. You know... I haven't had a birthday party for myself in a while...\nEdgeworth:\nMaybe you should blow out those candles over there to make up for that.\nGumshoe:\nMr. Edgeworth? Would you mind singing \"Happy Birthday\" to me?\nBikini:\nS-Stop that! Cut that out! Please don't blow out the altar candles!\n\n\n\n\nMagatama on altar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...That thing sure casts a strong presence over the whole room.\nBikini:\nThis is the \"Lesser Magatama\". It's a precious heirloom containing a great many souls.\nGumshoe:\nHuh...!? This is \"lesser\"!? What is the \"greater\" one like?\nBikini:\nThe \"Greater Magatama\" is displayed in the Main Room of Fey Manor. It was supposed to be shown at the Treasures of Kurain exhibit... But, it was so large that they couldn't bring it through the doors.\n\n\n\n\nLeft corner near altar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(There are more enza cushions in the corner of the room.) ...What's that white piece of paper sticking out from under that stack...?\nGumshoe:\nHmm... Beats me.\nEdgeworth:\nWould you mind checking that for me, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir! Here you are, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nIt looks like an old manila envelope...\nGumshoe:\nEeeeeeeeeeaaaah!!\nEdgeworth:\n...What is it, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nTh-This... This could be it! An ultra important clue! A super-special clue!\nEdgeworth:\n...I suppose I should read it myself then.\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like a letter addressed to Sister Iris. \"tonight at 10 at Heavenly Hall. ... ...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed.\"\nEdgeworth:\nTh-This sounds like a blackmail letter...!\nNote to Iris added to the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\nNice going there, Mr. Edgeworth! Why can't I ever find clues like that!? You're an ultra-important prosecutor!! A super-duper prosecutor!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, I suppose it takes a super-duper kind of dumb to miss a clue like this.\n\n\n\n\nLeft corner near altar (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(There are more enza cushions in the corner of the room.)\nGumshoe:\nNice going there, Mr. Edgeworth!

After dinner, the two of us went to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple.\nEdgeworth:\n(She must be talking about Maya...) Approximately what time was that...?\nBikini:\nI suppose it was about 9:00 when we left here. Training lasts all night long. It's extremely exhausting. The channeling dojo's Head Nun must be in attendance at all times to keep watch.\nGumshoe:\nWow, you're right! That does sound exhausting!\nEdgeworth:\nDetective, this is no time for flattery.\nGumshoe:\nSorry.\nEdgeworth:\nSome time around 11:00, you witnessed the incident in the courtyard. But your duty was in the Inner Temple. Why did you come back here?\nBikini:\nHmm... The way you're staring at me, I'm starting to get goosebumps! Ha ha ha ho ho!\nEdgeworth:\n(Nngh... I'm starting to get goosebumps myself, but for a decidedly different reason.)\nGumshoe:\nHo ho, you get the chills pretty easy, don't you Mr. Edgeworth?\n\n\n\n\nWhat you saw\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAlright then... I'd like you to tell me exactly what you saw in the courtyard.\nBikini:\nIt must have been past 11:00. Ah! No! I can't say it! It-It's too much for my poor heart!\nGumshoe:\nHey! Calm down, lady! L-Let go of my tie!\nBikini:\n...I saw two people! One of them was lying on the ground... Th-The other one was stabbing her from the back... with a sword!\nEdgeworth:\nDid you see this criminal with your own eyes?\nBikini:\nI didn't want to believe what I was seeing...! ...But it was Iris!\nEdgeworth:\nYou must have been quite shocked.\nGumshoe:\nOf course she was! Try putting yourself in her shoes! It'd be like if you were stabbing Mr. Wright smack in the middle of a courtroom! And I happened to witness it from the witness stand! ...I'd be pretty shocked too.\nBikini:\nI know it sounds insane... But that's what I saw. And when I finally realized what I was seeing, I screamed, and then... I passed out.\nEdgeworth:\n(...Unfortunately for us, her testimony seems to be pretty solid.)\nBikini:\nHowever... The idea of Iris doing such a foul act seems... unnatural.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Unnatural\"...?\nBikini:\nThe girl I know simply isn't capable of this sort of foulness...\nEdgeworth:\n(...I wonder what she means by that?)\n\n\n\n\nWhy return? (appears after \"The night of the crime\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAs the head nun, it's your duty to stay with the acolyte at all times, correct?\nBikini:\nYes, that's correct. I know I may look strong, but the truth is... I've got a bad lower back.\nEdgeworth:\nA bad lower back...?\nBikini:\nYes, it's especially bad in the winter. So bad that I can't even lift a bucket. Do you remember how cold it was last night? My bad back felt as stiff as frozen glass. I just wanted to take a nice hot bath to ease my aching back... That's why I returned to the Main Hall.\nEdgeworth:\nSo you left the disciple all alone?\nBikini:\nDon't be ridiculous! I would never do that! That's why I ordered Iris to the Inner Temple after she had rung the bell for lights out.\nEdgeworth:\n(Yes, but she never went to the Inner Temple, did she? So did this head nun actually see Iris there? (Changed from [Did this head nun even see Iris?] in the original release) I think I'd better try to get some more details...)\n\n\n\n\nThe acolyte (appears after \"What you saw\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo who is this acolyte that was to train at the Inner Temple...?\nBikini:\nHer name is Maya Fey... I treated her very badly, I'm ashamed to say. And after she went through the trouble of signing up for the Special Course...\nGumshoe:\n\"Special Course\"?\nBikini:\nIt's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant 30,000 times...\nEdgeworth:\nYou don't mean to tell me she's still doing that over at the Inner Temple, do you?\nBikini:\nNo, no, no. Of course not! You don't have to worry about that one little bit. Last night, we still hadn't started the training session itself.\nEdgeworth:\nWell, um... That's good to hear.\nBikini:\n...Oh! Dear, dear! There's one thing I forgot to tell you.\nGumshoe:\n...Uh-oh, I don't think I like the sound of this.\nBikini:\nDo you know that small girl? I believe she is Mystic Maya's little sister.\nEdgeworth:\n(Maya has a little sister...?)\nGumshoe:\nOh, you mean little Pearl! That's Maya Fey's cousin.\nEdgeworth:\nLittle... Pearl...?\nBikini:\nI thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after we'd finished with dinner cleanup... (Changed from [I thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after cleaning up dinner...] in the original release) But I haven't seen her at all since late last night! She's nowhere to be found!\nEdgeworth:\nY-You mean she...!? She was with the victim!?\nBikini:\nIt's all the fault of my stupid, creaky old back!\nEdgeworth:\n(A little girl who was with the victim on the night of the murder... is gone!)\nGumshoe:\nAs they say... \"The plot thickens!\"Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagatama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nTh-That's...! That's one of the Fey clan's very own Magatamas! That's a priceless treasure you've got there!\nGumshoe:\nW...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me!\nBikini:\nYes... You don't look it, but now I can see you're a real fan of the occult!\nEdgeworth:\nExcuse me?\nBikini:\nOh, of course this piece couldn't possibly be real, but to have such a nice replica... Clearly, you are a big fan of the Kurain Tradition!\nGumshoe:\nW...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me!\nEdgeworth:\n(I should have known better than to show this thing around...)\n\n\n\n\nHanging Scroll\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nHuh... Ahh! Well, well, well... Look what you've found! That's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, Mystic Misty Fey!\nEdgeworth:\n\"Fey\"...\nBikini:\nIt's been nearly 20 years since Mystic Misty's disappearance. Apparently, she intended to pass on the Master title to her daughter.\nEdgeworth:\nWho is this daughter?\nBikini:\nWell, I myself am part of a branch family of the Fey clan. But even I am not privy to information concerning the main family...\n\n\n\n\nIris's Hood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nWell, well, well! That's a Demon-Warding Hood! Acolytes are highly susceptible to possession by evil spirits, you know. That's why we always wear these for protection.\nEdgeworth:\nOh, I see...\nBikini:\nWhat are you waiting for? You won't get any protection just by holding it, you know! Put it on already!\nEdgeworth:\nNo! I can't...! I was just...!\nBikini:\n... Ha ha ha ho ho ho!\nGumshoe:\nHo ho ho! It's like it was made just for you, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean by that, Detective!?\nBikini:\nIt looks absolutely marvelous!

Cult!\" New Year's Issue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAbout this picture...\nBikini:\nWell look at that! I look pretty s-to-the-exy, don't you think!?\nGumshoe:\nUm, ah... Y-Yeah. Absolutely.\nBikini:\nUp until recently, we've avoided exposure in such magazines. But this time we had our reasons...\nEdgeworth:\nIs that so? For exampl--?\nBikini:\nHa ha ha ha ha!!! Well, why deny the world the sight of such a lovely face!?\n\n\n\n\nPhoto of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\n...Ohhhh! H-How could such a... terrible thing have happened...? It's all... It's all... It's all my fault!\nGumshoe:\nWell come on, lady... I don't think you need to take all the blame yourself.\nBikini:\nQuiet! What do you know anyway!?\nGumshoe:\n...Ouch. You're scary!\nBikini:\nWith that stupid 5 o'clock shadow and that stupid old coat of yours... It's too bad that you weren't the one that disappeared!\nGumshoe:\n... ...Why does she have to take it all out on me?\nEdgeworth:\n(Her anger does seem a little... manufactured.)\n\n\n\n\nNote to Iris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nDo you know anything about this old, crumpled-up letter?\nBikini:\n... Is that addressed to Iris?\nGumshoe:\nYup, it clearly says \"To Iris\" on it.\nBikini:\nI can't believe it... That girl doesn't have any secrets from me...\nEdgeworth:\n(Ah... So Sister Bikini didn't know anything about it...)\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix Wright profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nThis man... His face betrays a life of suffering and great weariness of the world.\nEdgeworth:\n...Um, sure.\nBikini:\nBut even so... I can't believe this guy actually jumped into the river! Think of all the fun things he might have enjoyed if he had just lived... Relentless spiritual training alone is no way to lead a complete life, huh...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n(It sounds like she's got some major regrets she's dealing with... Hmm... Perhaps I should let Gumshoe explain Wright's situation to her for me...)\nGumshoe:\nH-Hey! Don't look at me like that! Do you own dirty work! ...Sir!\n\n\n\n\nLarry Butz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nThis is Mystic Elise's apprentice, is it not? I think he might have a bit of a crush on me... Sweet boy at any rate.\nGumshoe:\nHuh?\nBikini:\nOh, I don't blame him. Sister Bikini understands the temptations of young men.\nEdgeworth:\n...Sure.\nBikini:\nBut I'm afraid it wouldn't be proper to abuse my position. I am head nun, after all. But, in return, I did allow him to draw a portrait of me.\nEdgeworth:\n(I pray it was a pose that maintained your modesty. For everyone's sake...)\n\n\n\n\nIris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou said you went with Maya to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple last night. Did you happen to see Iris while you were there?\nBikini:\nOf course I saw her. I told her to meet us after ringing the 10:00 bell for lights out.\nGumshoe:\nSo you're saying Iris came to the Inner Temple then?\nBikini:\nOf course she did. Iris has always been a good, obedient girl. After that, I had Maya begin her training ceremony.\nEdgeworth:\n(But that doesn't fit with Iris's story at all... She said that she never went to the Inner Temple!)\nGumshoe:\nAs they say... \"The plot thickens!\"\n\n\n\n\nBikini profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nIt's all my fault... Me and my stupid back! Mystic Elise has been murdered, an important acolyte is trapped... ...and a little girl has been lost!\nGumshoe:\nYou know you really shouldn't be so negative. It creates bad karma...\nBikini:\n...Quite right. I need to do some more training myself, I think...\n\n\n\n\nMaya Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nShe's a very important visitor, you know! An honored acolyte!\nEdgeworth:\n\"Honored\"? How so?\nBikini:\nThe Fey name is synonymous with the Kurain Channeling Technique. Therefore, she must be a spirit medium of great power indeed.\nGumshoe:\nNow that you mention it, one year ago... ...there was a case that was about the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique!\nEdgeworth:\n...Detective. I detest talk of supernatural drivel. I suppose now you'll say she has midi-chlorians?\nGumshoe:\nHo ho ho. So it gives you the creeps, huh, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n(...That's got nothing to do with it.)\n\n\n\n\nPearl Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nOh, this poor girl... Where could she have gone...?\nGumshoe:\nWell, we checked out her home and she's not there.\nBikini:\nAnd she's nowhere in the vicinity of the temple either...\nEdgeworth:\n(Which means... ...there's only a few other possibilities as to where she could be.)\nGumshoe:\nAh! Do you think maybe she fell off the bridge and was carried downstream...!?\nEdgeworth:\n... Why do you have to be such a pessimist, Detective!?\nGumshoe:\nNngh... I was just trying to think like you, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\n(Ironic. I became a pessimist only after I had the pleasure of working with you!)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nUmm, about this here...\nBikini:\nHmm... Let me see... Well, as you may know... In order to see reality for what it truly is... ...we strive to break our attachments to much of the transient, material realm. I guess you could call me an \"immaterial girl\"!\nGumshoe:\nI guess she lives in an immaterial world, huh Mr. Edgeworth?Main Gate (before clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nI'm just no good with people like her.

Don't you think you're expecting a little too much of me? I'm just a 25 year old jobless bum trying to be an apprentice artist!

Are you really gonna defend that nun, Iris, at the trial tomorrow?Edgeworth:\nYes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitment. (Changed from [Yes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitments.] in the original release)Gumshoe:\nWell, in that case... I've gotta be careful... Gotta make sure I don't leak the prosecution's whole investigation...Edgeworth:\nDon't worry about it, Detective. Just keep your mouth closed and I think most of it will flow out on its own.Gumshoe:\n... You got it, sir! I'll make sure it flows out like water from a tap! (Changed from [Roger, sir!

You're right! But I'm pretty sure the Main Hall didn't have a 2nd floor.\nEdgeworth:\nHazakura Temple was built on a steep part of the mountain. The front and back of the Main Hall are on different levels.\nGumshoe:\nOh... That makes sense...

Let's see if we can summarize what we've learned so far.\nGumshoe:\nOK! Let's take a look at the map. ...According to the testimony of Sister Bikini, the head nun... ...right after they'd finished dinner, she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple. (Changed from [...she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple right after dinner was finished.] in the original release) At 10 PM, after ringing the bell for lights out, Iris went to the Inner Temple. When she got there, Bikini had her take over while she went back to Hazakura Temple. After taking a hot bath to soothe her back... ...Sister Bikini witnessed the murder in the courtyard! If you want more details, you should ask Bikini herself in the Main Hall.\nEdgeworth:\n(The Inner Temple, huh...? I'd like some more information about that place...)\n\n\n\n\nTomorrow's trial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe trial begins tomorrow, but who's the prosecutor?\nGumshoe:\nI'm pretty sure it's that Godot guy, but... ...nobody can get a hold of him, so they're looking for a replacement.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean...?\nGumshoe:\nIt's really weird. All of a sudden, no one can reach him! Hmm, I wonder if the rumors are true. Maybe since Mr. Wright caught a cold and won't be defending, he just lost interest.\nEdgeworth:\nI intend to appear in court in the role of defense lawyer. However... I would be quite unhappy if it came out that I'm actually a prosecutor.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, I can see why. But I'm not the one you have to worry about... I think the real problem is gonna be that judge...\nEdgeworth:\n...Yes, he certainly would remember my face, even after such a long absence. That's why I requested another judge preside over the case. We've only met each other once. There's a good chance he won't remember me at all.\nGumshoe:\nY-Yeah, but... what about the prosecutor? Everyone in the prosecutor's office must know you! Wouldn't it be a problem if someone there made a big stink, sir?\nEdgeworth:\nThere's no need to worry. I pulled a few strings and arranged for a prosecutor of my own choosing.\nGumshoe:\nWow, Mr. Edgeworth... I had no idea you had such a powerful string to pull!\n\n\n\n\nInner Temple (appears after \"What happened\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this Inner Temple that Maya was supposedly training at...?\nGumshoe:\nAccording to Bikini, it's an old building they use for training the acolytes. It's on the other side of Dusky Bridge.\nEdgeworth:\n(The bridge that burned down, huh...) Is there anything else on the other side of that bridge besides the Inner Temple?\nGumshoe:\nNope, not a thing.\nEdgeworth:\nNothing?\nGumshoe:\nThe other side is surrounded by cliffs on all sides... In a way, it's kinda like a little island out there.\nEdgeworth:\n(So the only thing there is the Inner Temple...)\nGumshoe:\nI hear it's not the kind of place a person could survive in.\nEdgeworth:\n(Please be alright, Maya...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictim's Staff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nOh, so I think I might have already told you about this, but... The truth is... When I was a little kid...\nEdgeworth:\nYou wanted to become a wizard, right?\nGumshoe:\nHey, that's amazing! How did you know that!? So? What do you think? I'd make a really great one, don't you think?\nEdgeworth:\nWe just had this conversation a little while ago, Detective!\n\n\n\n\nShichishito\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThis sword represents the multiple branches that life can take, all ending as one.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... I've never heard that one.\nGumshoe:\nYou know what I think about sometimes? What kind of life would I have had if I hadn't joined the Homicide Division.\nEdgeworth:\n...So you think about that kind of thing too, huh?\nGumshoe:\nOf course I do. I think about it a lot. Me as a traffic cop. Me as a detention officer. Me as the Blue Badger...\nEdgeworth:\n(...I guess he doesn't have any plans to leave the force.)\n\n\n\n\nBikini profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThis is the witness who saw the crime take place out there in the temple courtyard. I'm pretty sure it's gonna be her testimony that'll be key to this case, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nSo you mean she's going to be a witness in the trial tomorrow...?\nGumshoe:\nOf course! A nun is as trustworthy as you can get! We got this one in the bag! ... Oh. I-I mean, I've always been on your side, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! So yeah, this is a pretty tight spot we've gotten ourselves into, huh!?\nEdgeworth:\n(Now I understand why Wright is always breaking into a cold sweat...)\n\n\n\n\nMaya Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI wonder if Maya is alright? I could never show my face to Wright again if something were to happen to her.\nGumshoe:\nAww, it'll be OK. If that ever happens, you can just show him my face. How's that...?\nEdgeworth:\n...\nGumshoe:\nAck! Um, I didn't mean it like that, sir! It was just a silly little joke!\nEdgeworth:\nI wonder if there is another way to get across to the other side? The support wires for the bridge are still intact, correct?\nGumshoe:\nThat bridge is almost 20 yards long... I know I may look like it, Mr. Edgeworth, but I'm no super hero.\nEdgeworth:\n(In any case, I just hope Maya is alright...)\n\n\n\n\nPearl Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat about Pearl...? Has no one seen her at all since last night?\nGumshoe:\nSeems that way... Apparently, she hasn't gone back to Kurain Village either, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nBut it's true that she was with Elise Deauxnim at some point last night?\nGumshoe:\nNo doubt about it. Ah...! Y-You mean that maybe whoever killed Ms. Deauxnim also...!?\nEdgeworth:\nD-Don't jump to any crazy conclusions!\nGumshoe:\nOooooouuuch! ...You sure have one mean punch, Mr. Edgeworth! It's down-right fierce!After clearing all Talk options in Dusky Bridge, clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate, clearing all Talk options and examining left corner near altar in Hazakura Temple - Main Hall, and clearing all Talk options and examining staff and Ami Fey statue in Hazakura Temple - Courtyard:February 8Detention CenterVisitor's RoomIris:\nAh...

Where is it on this map...?\nIris:\n...It's around here. To get there, you must follow a small path down from Dusky Bridge... The reality is, to get to the Inner Temple, I had no choice but to cross that bridge. But the thought that such a terrible criminal could be lurking at Heavenly Hall... I...

She said that when Maya Fey began her training at the Inner Temple... ...you were there as well.\nIris:\nWhat...!?\nEdgeworth:\nWhen I spoke with you last, you claimed that you never went to the Inner Temple. And yet, Sister Bikini says she met with you at the Inner Temple that very night.\nIris:\nB-But I... I didn't go there! I didn't go to the Inner Temple last night.\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm...

That's why I'm committed to searching until I have those answers. Now then, is it really true that you didn't go to the Inner Temple last night...?\nIris:\nY-Yes, I swear... I already told you that.\nEdgeworth:\n...Yes. You said you didn't go because you were frightened.\nIris:\n...Th-That's right.\nEdgeworth:\nIf that's the case... ...then the obvious question is, \"What were you so afraid of?\"\nIris:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nIris...

(Changed from [I even chased one of them to Tibet... Next it's going to be prison, I guess.] in the original release) ...I'll steal that detective's wallet. That'll get me locked up for sure. ...Nah. I can't do that to someone who looks like he's down on his luck.Gumshoe:\n...He's just talking to himself.Edgeworth:\nShh! Be quiet and listen!Butz:\nI knew it... I shouldn't have done that! I blew it again...Edgeworth:\n(\"Done that\"? What did he do, I wonder...)Gumshoe:\nHey! You! About what you just said... I got an objection!Butz:\nWh-Wh-Wh-What the...!? Ed-Edgey! You dirty rat!Edgeworth:\n*glare* (Gumshoe... You oaf...!)Gumshoe:\nI-I'm sorry, sir! Before I knew it, I was shouting out, \"Objection!\". And in a loud, commanding voice, too! I even pointed with my pointer finger!Edgeworth:\n...You've watched too many trials.Gumshoe:\nI'm sorry!Edgeworth:\nOK, Larry, the jig is up. What have you got to say for yourself?Butz:\nUngh...Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEagle River\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThis is the Eagle River, sir. It runs pretty fast, so it doesn't ice over, even in the winter.\nEdgeworth:\nIf it had iced over, Wright would have been in some serious trouble.\nGumshoe:\nYou're right about that! He would've landed on the ice, and slid downstream to who knows where.\nEdgeworth:\n(...Not exactly what I meant, but alright...)\n\n\n\n\nDusky Bridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt's a little far, but I have a pretty clear view of Dusky Bridge from here.\nButz:\nAhh. I still can't believe it! ...Really.\nEdgeworth:\n...? What is it, Larry?\nButz:\nHuh! Err, uhh, nothing. It's nothing!\nGumshoe:\nSounds pretty suspicious to me!\nEdgeworth:\n(Something about that statement smells... And you know what they say...)\n\n\n\n\nStairway\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThese go all the way to Dusky Bridge. It's a pretty long, but easy, walk.\nGumshoe:\nI fell down 4 times on my way down here, sir!\nButz:\nOh, sorry about that, Detective. I ate four bananas and tossed their peels on the stairs on my way down here...\nGumshoe:\n... What!? So that's what I was slipping on!\nButz:\nBe careful on the way back. Those deadly banana peels are still out there.\nGumshoe:\nHmm... That's a real important piece of information right there, Mr. Edgeworth!\n\n\n\n\nString of flags\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this festive-looking ornament?\nButz:\nIt reminds me of art class in grade school. We used to have a lot of fun decorating the classroom with origami. Remember?\nEdgeworth:\nW-Well, I...\nButz:\nOh, yeah... You were never any good at it.\nGumshoe:\nReally?\nButz:\nYeah, this guy was so bad, he couldn't even fold a dollar, let alone a crane. Everyone tried to comfort him, but he would just sit there sobbing.\nGumshoe:\nReally? I never would have expected that.\nEdgeworth:\nBe quiet already! I'll never forget the shame of that day! You want a crane! I can now make a perfect quarter-inch crane without a single flaw!\nButz:\n... You know, Edgey... Nothing for nothing, but a quarter-inch crane without a single flaw is not easy.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's quite a feat, Prosecutor Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\n(Grr... This is exactly why I hate childhood friends...)\n\n\n\n\nShack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThat's a horrible graffiti problem you've got there, pal.\nButz:\nYou don't know anything, Detective. This is art! It's an expression of my bittersweet love for Iris.\nEdgeworth:\nLarry. Do you know what the difference between graffiti and true art is?\nButz:\n... It's how the artist himself defines it, right?\nEdgeworth:\n... (I should've seen that one coming.)\nGumshoe:\nWell, if that's the case, then all of my lunchboxes are masterpieces too, pal!\n\n\n\n\nRoof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe straw roof is totally covered with freshly fallen powdery snow.\nGumshoe:\nWow, makes a nice image, doesn't it? I always did like the rustic look.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Heavenly Hall\"... I suppose it's an appropriate name in some sense.\nButz:\nYou got that right. Look at that bridge up there. This place has to be heaven, because that thing is hell.\nEdgeworth:\n... You would do well to remember, Larry... ...that this is a sacred place to some people.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeavenly Hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this little shack anyway?\nButz:\nWell, I just discovered it myself yesterday.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd why were you down here in the first place?\nButz:\nErr, come on... I'm an artist... I was looking for a good place to sketch. This is a great little place! It's err... artistic. It's quiet, it's cold, it's got no power, and it looks like it's about to collapse.\nGumshoe:\n...Sounds a lot like my apartment there, pal.\nEdgeworth:\n(One thing's for sure... No one is likely to show up and disturb you here...)\nButz:\nSo can I get you something to drink? Some hot water, maybe?\nGumshoe:\n...He's getting all buddy-buddy on us, sir.\n\n\n\n\nIris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\n...Listen to me, Edgey. You've gotta do this... You've gotta save Iris!\nEdgeworth:\nWhy are you so sure she's innocent? Because she's cute?\nButz:\nWatch your mouth! Anyway, I've made up my mind about it! I'm going to marry that girl!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nGumshoe:\nUmm... Mr. Edgeworth is pretending he didn't hear you, so I'm gonna ask for him. Have you already asked this girl to marry you?\nButz:\nNo, no. Not yet. But I can tell how she feels by the look in her eyes! She's got this \"I really want this man to carry me over the threshold\" look! I'm sure Nick would be surprised! He'd never imagine that I could marry such a beautiful girl like that!\nEdgeworth:\nSomething tells me he would be shocked, indeed.\nButz:\nThat's why I didn't want her to do anything dangerous. I mean, what am I gonna do if she gets hurt?\nGumshoe:\n... What is this guy trying to say? He lost me about a mile back...\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... If we really want to know the answer to that... (...we're going to have to drag him onto the witness stand.)\n\n\n\n\nThe night of the crime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nCome to think of it, you still haven't answered my question. Where were you and what were you doing last night?\nButz:\nAww, man... Don't you have anything else to talk about? With that kind of attitude, you'll never be a ladies' man like me...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nButz:\nO-OK, OK! Chill out with those scary eyes! I got it! If you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Something incredible\"?\n\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n\nButz:\n...Yeah, yeah. But let's not talk about that now. Let's talk about the good old days. What do you say? Come on, I'll pour you a nice cup of hot water.\nEdgeworth:\n(Why hasn't he realized... ...that I absolutely despise talking about the \"good old days\", especially with him?)\n\n\n\n\nThe night of the crime (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat exactly did you see last night?\nButz:\nWell... It's kinda hard to say...\n\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n\nButz:\nIt's one of those things... Ya know what I mean...? It's like... It's not so much \"what\" I saw, as it's the situation in general... You see what I'm getting at? Whew, that's a relief. Thanks, buddy. Ha ha ha ha ha.\nEdgeworth:\n(I have the strangest urge to smash this guy against those big, nasty locks...)\n\n\n\n\nThe night of the crime (after breaking Psyche-Locks)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo you were here in Heavenly Hall last night, were you not, Larry? And you saw the lightning hit Dusky Bridge, didn't you?\nButz:\nS-Sorry, Edgey...\nGumshoe:\nSorry doesn't cut it, you scumbag! Threatening a young lady like that...\nButz:\n*gulp*... ... Wait, hold up.\nGumshoe:\n...What now, pal?\nButz:\nWhat are you talking about!? What \"threatening\" stuff!?\nGumshoe:\nI'll tell you what! You tried to scare Iris by threatening to expose her secret, pal!\nButz:\nWhat do you mean threaten!? When did I threaten her!?\nGumshoe:\n\"...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed...\" That sure sounds like a threat to me, pal! Blackmail, in fact!\nButz:\nGimme a break! It's a love letter! Haven't you ever been in love!?\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What did you just say!?\nButz:\nMy love for her burns so hotly, it could melt all the snow on this mountain!\nEdgeworth:\nO-Oh? Then what is this secret you mention!?\nButz:\nCome on, Edgey... Don't you get it? I'm talking about the secret love between her and me! Obviously she wouldn't want old lady Bikini to know about it, right...? About our... hot and sour... bittersweet love affair!\nEdgeworth:\n... Alright, then why did you send a love letter in a business-like manila envelope!?\nButz:\nGive me a break! It's not my fault I didn't have any other envelopes! Yeesh!\nGumshoe:\nThen why were you so quick to apologize, pal!?\nButz:\nIt's cuz Edgey gave me that scary look of his!\nEdgeworth:\n... ...\nButz:\nWhat's wrong, Edgey? Why are you so quiet all of a sudden?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's it? THAT'S what all those huge locks were about? (Changed from [That's it? That's all [sic] those huge locks were about?] in the original release) I-I don't understand why you were so defensive...\nButz:\nWell, I dunno either... I guess the thing is... ...you shouldn't expect too much from a guy like me. ...Hey, come on. Don't let it get you down!\nGumshoe:\n... B-But Mr. Edgeworth! This guy is still hiding something! I know it!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nDon't forget what this guy said just a minute ago!\n\n\nButz:\nIf you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible.\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm... He's right!) Larry!\nButz:\nWh-What!? Y-You're looking at me like a hungry dog that just found a bone!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat was this \"something incredible\" you saw last night...? ...You're going to tell me, Larry! One way or another!\n\n\n\n\nSomething incredible (appears after \"The night of the crime\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"I... I already told you, didn't I?\"Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagatama (after clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\n\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n-- The Night of the Crime --\nEdgeworth:\nAlright, now you're going to tell me what you really saw last night...\nButz:\nWhoa. You're really upset, aren't you, Edgey? OK, I'll talk!\nEdgeworth:\n...Huh? (That was a bit too easy...)\nButz:\nYeah, anyway! It was awesome! Never seen anything like it! At around 10 o'clock last night, it started thundering. I'd been sleeping... I'm not sure for how long. Suddenly... ZING! The world in front of me went white! Like I'd just been slapped in the face by my old girlfriend, Naomi!\nEdgeworth:\n...And then?\nButz:\nAnd then... It was on fire! The bridge was on fire!\nEdgeworth:\nDusky Bridge caught on fire!? Are you saying you saw it with your own eyes?\nButz:\nHey! Why are you giving me the evil eye!? I'm telling the truth!\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm... There are still three Psycholocks remaining... (Changed from [Hmm... There are still 3 Psycholocks remaining...] in the original release) That means he's still trying to hide something...) By the way, Larry... Where were you when you saw that happen?\nButz:\nWh-Wh-Wh-Where you say? Wh-Wh-What do you mean!?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean, \"What do I mean\"!? ...Just answer the question!\nButz:\nI-I was in my own room... by the Main Hall! Where else would I be!?\nEdgeworth:\nAs usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar. The problem, I suspect, lies there...\nButz:\nTh-Th-Th-Th-There? Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Whaddya mean th-th-there?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's impossible for you to have seen lightning strike Dusky Bridge from your room!\n\n\n\nPresent Hazakura Temple Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This is a map of the area.

Try drinking your hot water. If you don't drink it fast it's going to get cold.\nEdgeworth:\nOh, sorry... (It's cold alright... The water... And my evidence.)\nButz:\nWell? Have you calmed down yet?\nEdgeworth:\nUm, yes... I'm going to think it over again.\nButz:\nH-Hey, I'm telling you... there's nothing to think over! I was in my room doing \"she loves me, she loves me not\" with a bunch of flowers.\nLeads back to:\n\"As usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar.\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis is a map of the area. Take a look around the vicinity of Hazakura Temple.\nButz:\nWh-What am I looking for?\nEdgeworth:\nI think that should be fairly obvious. The Main Hall is surrounded by trees and it's impossible to see the bridge from here.\nButz:\nWhat...!? Why didn't you tell me that before!?\n\n1 LOCK BROKEN\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Well? How about it?\nButz:\nHow about what?\nEdgeworth:\nDo you feel like talking now?\nButz:\nAbout what?\nEdgeworth:\n... (It looks like it won't be that easy after all...) ...You leave me no choice. I'll have to move on to the next step. You weren't in your room at the temple. So then... Where were you?\nButz:\nY-Y-You don't know that I wasn't in my room!\nEdgeworth:\n(So where was Larry, and why was he there...? If I've read the situation up to this point correctly, the answer is fairly obvious.) ...Very well then. Let's test my theory. The place you witnessed lightning striking Dusky Bridge from was... here!\n\n\n\nPresent Heavenly Hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall!\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis is where you were! Well, what do you think, Larry!?\nButz:\nOh... Not much I guess.\nEdgeworth:\n... I'm sorry, but what kind of answer is that?\nButz:\nWell, you were just making small talk, right? Like \"How are you doing?\" or something.\nEdgeworth:\n...Larry. Look at the expression on my face. Do I look like I was just making small talk?\nButz:\nTo be honest? No... I guess not. Ha ha ha ha ha...\nEdgeworth:\n(It appears I didn't think it through carefully enough.)\nLeads back to:\n\"So where was Larry, and why was he there...?\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall!\nButz:\n...Wh-Why would I be hanging out in this old shack? It's freezing cold, there's no electricity, and it could fall apart at any minute...\nEdgeworth:\nLarry... How do you know that anyway? How do you know there's no electricity? After all, it's not that dark yet.\nButz:\nAh... Uh-oh!\nEdgeworth:\nIn other words, you have just provided evidence to prove my theory... My theory that you've at least once in your life visited Heavenly Hall after sunset!\n\n1 LOCK BROKEN\n\nButz:\nI have to admit I'm impressed, Edgey! You're in a totally different league from Nick.\nEdgeworth:\n...That's nice. Now tell me. What were you doing at this cold little shack last night?\nButz:\nThat's what you might call... A \"Fair de Core\".\nEdgeworth:\nI think you mean \"affaire de coeur\". Could it be you were... waiting for someone?\nButz:\nOoooh nooo! Y-You really are one scary guy, you know...\nEdgeworth:\nI believe that last night, you were waiting for this person to come meet you!\n\n\n\nPresent Iris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n \nEdgeworth:\n...Well, Larry!? Was it THIS person...?\nButz:\n...You know what? You should save your finger pointing for the courtroom.\nEdgeworth:\nTsk...!\nButz:\nIt's no wonder people call you a workaholic. You work too hard! You should be like me!\nEdgeworth:\n(Well, I'd rather \"work too hard\" than \"hardly work\" like a loafaholic like you...) In any case... I know you were waiting for someone!\nButz:\nYeah, but... It's like I said. It's an \"affaire de guerre\".\nEdgeworth:\nNo, Larry. You mean \"affaire de coeur\". At least I think you do.\nLeads back to:\n\"Could it be you were... waiting for someone?\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry.\nButz:\nI told you before... Don't call me \"Larry\"...\nEdgeworth:\nThe person you were waiting for was... Iris!\nButz:\nOhh... Suddenly I feel cold all over, Edgey.\nEdgeworth:\nNo doubt because of my chilly glare.\nButz:\nSo you think I got the hots for Sister Iris, huh...? D-Do you have some kind of evidence!? You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing?\nEdgeworth:\n(This is where I draw the line and end this ridiculous little game...)

I-Is it just me?\nEdgeworth:\nNow, I'm the one that suddenly feels cold...\nButz:\nMaybe it's because of my cold laugh?\nEdgeworth:\n(Grr... I hate making such stupid mistakes...)\nButz:\nDo you really have the evidence you say you do, Edgey?\nLeads back to:\n\"You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing?\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Here's your evidence. You called her to this spot with a pathetic blackmail letter!\nButz:\nOh! H-Hey! G-G-Give that back! You're embarrassing me! What are you doing with that anyway!?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's not important! ...I misjudged you, Larry.\nButz:\nWhat do you mean...?\nEdgeworth:\nTaking advantage of a woman's frailty like that! You should be ashamed of yourself!\nButz:\nOhhh... OHHHH!\nEdgeworth:\nFirst of all, what's this at the top of the letter? It says, \"Salutation here\"!\nButz:\nW-Well that's what it said in that book, \"Letter Writing for Dummies\"!\nEdgeworth:\nYou're not supposed to actually write that!

People acting bizarrely in my court! Uwa-hah!von Karma:\n...The stage is set. Now continue with the proceedings, Your Honor.Judge:\nVery well. Ms. von Karma, please give an outline of this case. With as little whipping as possible!von Karma:\nThe murder victim is the famed picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Her body was found in the Hazakura Temple courtyard. She had been stabbed through the torso by a ceremonial sword from a golden statue.Judge:\nThe sword in this picture... is the weapon in question, correct...? ...Very well. The court accepts this photo of the crime scene.Crime Photo added to the Court Record.von Karma:\nThere is no mistake. This was the doing of Sister Iris. After all... there is a witness to her crime.Judge:\n...Very well. Please bring this witness to the stand!Edgeworth:\n(And so it begins... My first and my last trial... as a defense attorney!)von Karma:\n...Witness. State your name and occupation. Please.Judge:\nH-Hold on here! I'm not sure about being not sure if I care for this at all! Witness! Please stand up nice and straight!Edgeworth:\nIf I recall correctly... ...there are a few milk crates in the Defendant's Lobby for our back pain-plagued witness. (Changed from [...there are a few milk crates in the defendant's lobby for witnesses with bad backs.] in the original release)Judge:\nBailiff! Fetch a crate for this poor lady, please!von Karma:\n...Once again. Your name and occupation, please.Bikini:\nLittle old me? Well, I'm the head nun of Hazakura Temple on Eagle Mountain. My name is Bikini. You got it? Bikini. Nice to meet everyone.Judge:\n... But you don't appear to be wearing a bikini right now... Uwah!von Karma:\n...The courtroom is the garden of holy judgment. Those with lechery in their hearts should leave this sanctuary at once!Judge:\nY-You want me to leave!?Bikini:\nNo need to get your bikinis in a twist! Let me tell you, I'm a sight to behold in summer! Wha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha!Edgeworth:\nIn any case... Witness. I hear that you saw the crime take place on the night in question.Bikini:\nThat's right! I can still hardly believe it myself, to be honest. There's no way dear little Iris could do anything like that...Judge:\nLet us hear what you have to say then. First, tell us aboot your own movements that night, eh!Witness Testimony-- The Night of the Murder --Bikini:\nThat night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But...\nWell, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently.\nSo, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.\nThere's no bath at the Inner Temple, you see, and I needed a long, hot soak.\nIt was after I had finished, just as I was heading back... that's when I saw it!Judge:\nHmm... So it was simply coincidence that you found yourself returning to Hazakura Temple?Bikini:\n...Yes, you could say that. If my back hadn't been in so much pain, I would have stayed at the Inner Temple.Edgeworth:\n(That sounds like a pretty important statement she just made...)von Karma:\nThere is only one problem with this testimony that I can see... And you're not about to fall at the first hurdle, now are you, Miles Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth. ...Please begin your cross-examination.Cross Examination",

Law OfficesMaya:\nHey, Nick.Phoenix:\nYeah? What is it?Maya:\nYou know how I've got spiritual powers, unlike you?Phoenix:\nUm, sure... You are a spirit medium, after all.Maya:\nBut just like you, if I don't keep my powers sharp, they get dull, right?Phoenix:\nUm... I guess so, yeah.Maya:\nGlad you agree! OK, Pearly! You're up!Phoenix:\n(Pearls...?)Pearl:\nSo! That's why we need to go on a special \"Spiritual Hot Spot Tour\", Mr. Nick!Phoenix:\n...Huh? I'm lost. What's this magazine you're shoving in my face?Pearl:\nIt's the New Year's issue of \"Oh! Cult!\", Winter Spiritual Locations Special!Phoenix:\n...Oh. (Pearls looks so happy.)Maya:\n\"Maximize your spiritual powers with just one night of intensive training!\" ...Oh! It sounds too good to be true!Phoenix:\nI'll say. It sounds more like a scam to me.Maya:\nIt's at a spiritual retreat called \"Hazakura Temple\". It's way up in the mountains, and I bet it's nice and cold. ...Just perfect for training!Phoenix:\n(Now I definitely don't want to go...)Maya:\nYou know, I think I've heard of this temple before. It's a famous channeling dojo. It's hard for even real spirit mediums like us to make reservations up there!Phoenix:\nReservations...? For a temple? Are you serious?Pearl:\nDon't worry! I've already made special reservations, just for us!Maya:\nYeah! And I signed up for the \"Special Course\"!Phoenix:\nTh-That's nice. And the timing couldn't be better. ...Since we don't have a case right now anyway.Maya:\nAlrighty then! It's settled! Well, come on! Don't just stand there! Start packing your stuff!Pearl:\nYes, Mr. Nick! You'd better start packing your stuff!Phoenix:\nHuh...? M-ME!? Why do I have to go!?Maya:\nWell, we have to be accompanied by someone over 20 years old.Phoenix:\nHey! I don't have anything to do with spirit power. The only thing I can channel is a TV. ... So, um, is there a heated pool at this \"Hazakura Temple\"?Pearl:\nNo, but you can stand under a freezing waterfall!Phoenix:\n... Sorry, but I think I'll pass. I hate cold places.Maya:\nWhaaat!? No way! How can you be so selfish!?Pearl:\nCome on, Mr. Nick! Look at this place! Doesn't it look beautiful!?Phoenix:\nNope. Not going. I'm gonna be nice and toasty at home....... .................What the...!?Pearl:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Nick?Phoenix:\nLet me see that magazine! Th-This nun...Maya:\nIs she a friend of yours or something, Nick?Phoenix:\n(Th-This girl... I-It's...!)Dahlia:\nMy name is Dahlia Hawthorne. I just want to say... It's an honor for me to be here in your noble presence.Dahlia:\nHonestly, how can any woman ever count on you for anything? ...You disgust me!Phoenix:\nBut... It can't be!

But, I just had to be see for myself... ...who this \"nun\" really was.)February 7, 3:24 PMHazakura TempleMain GateMaya:\nBrrrrr... It-It-It's so c-c-cold here, Nick!Phoenix:\nMaybe you should put on something warmer for a change!Maya:\nW-W-Well, it's supposed to be c-c-cold... It's t-t-training. ...Ah-Achoo!Phoenix:\n(Her teeth are chattering so loudly, it's all I can do to make out what she's saying...)Pearl:\nWow, Mystic Maya! So this is the famous Hazakura Temple!Maya:\nP-P-P-Pearly... I-I-I-I... Ah-Achoo!???:\nWell, well, well... How nice to see you here. Welcome to our temple!Maya:\nOh...! Th-Th-Thank you... Ah-Achoo!???:\nOh my, my, my... Thank you for coming all this way. Come now, come now. You must have been cold.Phoenix:\nWhat's with the past tense...? We're freezing into human popsicles as we spea--!???:\nHo ho ho. Well, we are high up in the mountains after all. In any case, we shouldn't speak here. ...Please follow me inside.Maya:\nTh-Thank you. I was starting to think I would pass--???:\nOh! Yes, yes! I almost forgot to introduce myself.Bikini:\nI'm the head nun here at the temple. My name is Bikini.Maya:\nB-B-B-Bikini...!?Bikini:\nThat's riiight! Actually, that's my \"temple\" name. What do you think? It's a tradition to have one, and I wanted something that has a nice image to it. So I thought, \"Why not choose a bikini?\" Besides, it makes me seem younger. Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho!Maya:\nIt certainly does! Oh, I signed up for your \"Special Course\"!Bikini:\nWell, my, my, my. Quite brave of you considering how cold it is! Young people can be so reckless with their health! Don't blame me if you become one with those you channel. Wa ha ha! Ho ho ho!Pearl:\nR-Reckless...?Maya:\n\"Wa ha ha\"...?Pearl:\nMaybe you should take it easy tonight, Mystic Maya... We can come back another day.Maya:\nBut you went through all that trouble to get reservations for m--Bikini:\nYes, yes, yes, that's right! You've come all this way, so please, enjoy yourselves! There's still time before supper, so why don't you have a look around?Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nWhat do you think, Nick? Pretty awesome gate, huh?\nPhoenix:\nIt sure is... It looks pretty well maintained, too. This thing kinda puts your hometown to shame, Maya.\nMaya:\nYeah... Well, a lot of things have happened in Kurain Village. We used to be a lot richer, back when people hired us to perform channelings.\nPhoenix:\nOh, I see... But now the place looks a bit run down...\nMaya:\nHmm... I guess I was just born in the wrong time.\n\n\n\n\nMain Hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nThat looks like the Main Hall where we'll be staying tonight. From here, it looks like one of those ice hotels you always hear about!\nPhoenix:\n...They gotta have a heater or something in there, don't you think? I don't wanna die.\nMaya:\nI'm not worried, I brought my hot-water bottle.\nPhoenix:\nDid you bring one for me?\nMaya:\nWhat are you talking about, Nick? Who carries around 2 hot-water bottles?\nPhoenix:\n(Brr! If the cold doesn't kill me, the ice queen over here will finish the job...)\n\n\n\n\nBell tower\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nOh, look! It's a cute little bell tower! I absolutely love the sound of a giant bell!\nPhoenix:\nOh? So, which do you like better? That or the sound of money?\nMaya:\n...! ...... Sorry, but I'll take money for the win, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What are you apologizing for?\n\n\n\n\nSnowmobile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nOh look, it's one of those snow motorcycle things!\nPhoenix:\nMost people call that a \"snowmobile\", you know.\nMaya:\n\"Snow motorcycle things\", \"Snowblowmeal\". Same thing. Hmm... Too bad we didn't invite Desirée. I bet she could race like the wind on this \"Slowmobile\"! Or maybe she'd give me ride on this \"Blowsnowbile\".\nPhoenix:\nArgh! I told you, it's \"snowmobile\"!Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanneling dojo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUmm... So what's a \"channeling dojo\" anyway?\nBikini:\nOh my, my, my... You don't even know that?\nMaya:\nForgive him, Sister, for he knows not what he is saying.\nBikini:\nWell, well, well. Just call me Bikini and forget that \"Sister\" part. A channeling dojo is basically a spiritual power training ground. We have special holy items prepared here to help people boost their spiritual power.\nPhoenix:\nH-Holy items...?\nBikini:\nIf you train an entire evening surrounded by these items... Aaah. It's quite mysterious. The spiritual power of these items seems to envelop you. Wa ha ha ha.\nPhoenix:\n(Wow, she must have just gotten off the trolley from the land of make-believe...)\nMaya:\nUm, so what exactly is the \"Special Course\"...?\nBikini:\nYou must be incredibly devoted to be interested in that at such a young age! It's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant a spell... ...30,000 times! All while being showered in freezing cold spirit water.\nMaya:\nEh...?\nBikini:\nIt's February now, right? You have to be careful this time of the year... If you don't watch it, you'll catch pneumonia or maybe even die of hypothermia... So be careful, you hear? Wa ha ha. Ho ho ho. Ha!\nMaya:\nHow am I supposed to \"be careful\"...?\nPearl:\nOh no... I knew I shouldn't have signed Mystic Maya up for this...\n\n\n\n\nThe other nun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUmm, Sister... About this picture...\nBikini:\nWell, well. Look at that. I must say I look rather divine here, don't you think?\nPhoenix:\nOh, um, yeah. Unforgettable in every way.\nBikini:\nYou mean it? Oh, I knew it! Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho ho! The makeup was pretty tough, but Iris helped me out.\nMaya:\n\"Iris\"...?\nBikini:\nThe cute little girl in the photo. She looks just like me, doesn't she? We're just a small temple here, so she and I run the entire place.\nMaya:\nReally? That kinda sounds like fu--\nPhoenix:\nSorry to cut in, but...! This \"Iris\"... Where is she right now?\nBikini:\nOh! Just listen to you! You haven't come all the way up here just to find a girlfriend, have you?\nPearl:\n... *glare*\nPhoenix:\nNo, no, no! Th-That's not what I had in mind at all...\nBikini:\nAnyway, Iris is in the Inner Temple preparing for this evening.\nMaya:\nInner Temple...?\nBikini:\nYes, yes, that's right. Iris will be back this evening. Why don't you go have a look at the Main Hall for now? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha.\nPhoenix:\n(So she's in the Inner Temple, huh...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm, do you think you could take a look at this?\nBikini:\nI may not look like it, but I can tell you I'm very much in demand. And to be quite honest, I'm finding this a little difficult to say...\nPearl:\n...What IS she trying to say, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI think she's trying to say that she's busy.\nMaya:\nBut seriously Nick, what's the deal? Nothing has even happened yet and you're already shoving evidence into people's faces. You need to forget about work and relax a little.\nPearl:\nTry to have some fun, OK Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, you're right... (Sure. Pin the hypothermia on the lawyer is great fun!)February 7Hazakura TempleMain HallMaya:\nBrr... It's fr-freezing in here, too! Achoo!Pearl:\nHee hee. It reminds me of the Meditation Room in Fey Manor!Phoenix:\n...Pearls, you've been in an unusually good mood since we got here.Pearl:\nWell, kids are made of energy, you know!Phoenix:\nAs for you, Maya, you look like you're about to catch a bad cold.Maya:\nW-W-Well, I'm not exactly a little kid anymore, I guess. Ah-Achoo!Phoenix:\n(Nngh... Is she going to make it...?)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSliding doors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI bet the writing on these sliding doors are instructions for spirit channeling... Kinda like how we scribbled math formulas on the bathroom walls to remember them. Except we couldn't go to the bathroom during tests... And I can't read these walls.\n\n\n\n\nObjects on floor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere are straw zabuton cushions arranged around a hibachi brazier... I haven't seen a layout like this since I saw this really old Japanese movie on TV. ...If it wasn't for this hibachi, they'd probably freeze to death.\n\n\n\n\nAltar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's an altar. It looks a bit old, but someone does a good job taking care of it. Speaking of altars, I remember seeing one like this in Kurain Village last year. I guess they really do have something to do with spiritual power after all.\n\n\n\n\nMagatama on altar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere's a laughably large Magatama on the altar. If I can see Psyche-Locks with the tiny Magatama I've got... ...I can only imagine what kind of power this bad boy has under his hood!\n\n\n\n\nLeft corner near altar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's a stack of straw zabuton cushions. Maya told me this type of zabuton is called \"enza\"... I suppose if I'd never come here, I'd have missed out on all these new things.February 7Suspension BridgeMaya:\nWow! Look at this broken down old bridge, Nick!Phoenix:\nY-Yeah, and look at that big canyon below us.Maya:\nHey! There's a river down there! It looks like it's flowing real fast! ...What's wrong, Nick? You look like you've seen a ghost!Phoenix:\nI-I'm just not very good with heights...Maya:\nOh... Hey! I've got it! Maybe you should face your fear and try hurling yourself off the edge? You know! One... Two... Three... Jump! It might be just what you need to get over your fear of heights!Phoenix:\n...Yeah, death is a real good way to overcome phobias alright. Anyway, it sure looks like a rickety bridge.Maya:\nCan't argue there. That's probably why it's called, \"Dusty Bridge\".Phoenix:\nRead it again, Maya. It says, \"Dusky Bridge\".Maya:\nWell, it's practically the same thing.Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCliff on opposite side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like it's about 20 yards to that cliff over there.\nMaya:\nI guess that's where I'll be training tonight. Do you want to train with me, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nAnd do the Special Course? I think not.\nMaya:\nBut it'd be so great if you had spiritual powers, too! (Really? \"I see dead people\" sounds more like a cause for alarm to me...)\n\n\n\n\nWooden sign on left side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere's a narrow path going off in a different direction than that of the Main Hall.\nMaya:\nThe sign here is so old, the text seems to have vanished.\nPhoenix:\nThe path leads to a wooden staircase that goes down to the bottom of the canyon.\nMaya:\nOK, I'll write, \"wooden staircase\" on it then.\nPhoenix:\n...Do you really think that is necessary? You'd have to be blind not to see the stairs.\nMaya:\nWell, it can't hurt. Just pass me a pencil, OK?\nPhoenix:\nGraffiti is a crime, Maya.\n\n\n\n\nBridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! Why don't we hop across the bridge. It'll be fun!\nPhoenix:\nI'm not so sure... It looks like a bunny hopping across the bridge would destroy it.\nMaya:\nOK, Nick. Then let's try to find a cute little white bunny and test your theory.\nPhoenix:\n(That right there sums up the fundamental difference between sane and insane.)\n\n\n\n\nBoulder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSome letters are engraved into a roughly cut boulder.\nMaya:\n\"D-U-S-T-Y Bridge\", huh?\nPhoenix:\nIt says, \"Dusky\"! \"Dusky Bridge\"! OK?\nMaya:\nC'mon, Nick! Take a look at that bridge and tell me it's not supposed to be \"Dusty\"! This sign is obviously wrong, and I'm gonna fix it! Now give me a pencil, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nDo I look like a pencil holder to you?\n\n\n\n\nPublic phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nI can't believe there's a public phone here. Who would ever use it?\nPhoenix:\nThe people who live here, I guess. I doubt they have any real phones there.\nMaya:\nYeah, but it took like 20 minutes to walk here from the Main Hall! ... It would've been smarter of them to build the Main Hall here, don't you think?\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe you should work on channeling someone who makes logical sense, Maya.After clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate:February 7Hazakura TempleMain HallMaya:\nTh-Th-The Main Hall... I th-think it's even c-c-c-colder in here! Achoo!Pearl:\nAh! Mr. Nick! Do you smell that? It smells like meat and gravy!Maya:\nYeah, you're right! I guess it's pot roast for tonight! Yum!Phoenix:\n...Weird. I thought they would serve something a little more... well, traditional.Maya:\nWhat are you talking about, Nick!? You think monks and nuns just sit around eating rice gruel all the time!?Pearl:\nMystic Maya is right! Ooh! I hope there's mashed potatoes, too! I love mashed potatoes!???:\nHa ha ha... What a cute little acolyte! Greetings to all of you.Phoenix:\nOh... Um, hello. (Wow, this lady makes Maya look like a 6.8/10 on the weirdness scale.)Maya:\nYour outfit...

You're Ms. Elise Deauxnim!Elise:\nYes, that's right... You know of me?Pearl:\nM-M-My name... My name is Pearl Fey! I-I'm your biggest fan!Maya:\nWho is she, Nick?Phoenix:\nHmm... I see it now... Zvarri! A fortune-teller...?Pearl:\nI-I've got all your books, Ms. Deauxnim!Elise:\nHa, ha, ha... What a sweet thing to say. And please, call me Elise.Phoenix:\nUm, \"books\"...?Pearl:\nMr. Nick, don't you know anything!? Don't you even know who this is?Phoenix:\nWell, um... ...An author, maybe?Elise:\nYes, and an illustrator. ...Of picture books.Maya:\nPicture books, huh? Oh, now I get it...Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElise Deauxnim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... I'm sorry I didn't know who you are. I don't get a lot of chances to really enjoy picture books.\nElise:\nIt's alright. I take no offense to that. My books are nothing but simple stories for children.\nPearl:\nAnd really beautiful pictures too, Ms. Elise! Your books always make me feel as if my heart has been purified.\nElise:\nHa ha ha... It makes me feel very happy to hear you say that.\nPhoenix:\n(I do have to admit... She certainly seems like a kind, sensitive lady.)\nPearl:\nMs. Elise won an award last year for her book, \"The Magic Bottle\"!\nElise:\nYes... A friend of mine secretly submitted a story I had written to a publisher. They liked it so much that they asked if it was alright to make it into a book.\nPhoenix:\nWow... It must have been a really great story.\nMaya:\n...Maybe I should try to write a children's book, too. If I do, you can secretly send it to a publisher for me, Nick.\nElise:\nRecently, I've accepted a sort of... apprentice you might say.\nPhoenix:\nAn apprentice?\nElise:\nHe calls himself Laurice... Laurice Deauxnim. I believe he's off doing some landscape sketches now... On Laurice's behalf as well, I'd like to thank you for your support.\nPearl:\nOf course, Ms. Elise! Anything for you!\nElise:\nHa ha ha...\n\n\n\n\nWhy come here?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPearl:\nUm... Why did you come to Hazakura Temple, Ms. Elise? Are you here... to do some spiritual training?\nElise:\nHa ha ha... No, that's not it. I'm actually here to gather materials for a new book I'm working on.\nPearl:\nWow! I-I can't wait to read it!\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls is completely taken with her...)\nElise:\nI wanted to do a book with a more Japanese feel to it this time.\nPhoenix:\n...So is that why you're dressed like you are?\nElise:\nThe children have a certain image of me in their minds. I don't want to disappoint them...\nPhoenix:\n(What can I say... She's really a sweet lady...)\nPearl:\nWow, Ms. Elise, you're dressed up like a mountain nun!\nElise:\nYes. The good people here were kind enough to let me borrow this... I'm wearing training clothes underneath my robe, as well.\nMaya:\n...I want a staff like that.\nElise:\nYou like the crystal sphere? It's real amethyst, you know.\nMaya:\nMaybe we'll find one like that up here on this mountain. Good luck, Nick! I know you'll find me one!Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMs. Deauxnim? What do you think about this?\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Do you think Ms. Elise is a suspect?\nPhoenix:\nHuh...?\nPearl:\nYou may be Mystic Maya's special someone, but I won't let you do this to Ms. Elise!\nPhoenix:\n(A suspect? Why would I suspect her of anything? It's not like anything's happened.)\nMaya:\nIsn't it cute, Nick? Pearly's getting all overprotective of her new friend.After clearing all Talk options:Elise:\nWell, you'll have to excuse me now... I have to go help with the dinner preparations.Pearl:\nWow! You mean you're cooking dinner tonight?Elise:\nThat's right. Would you like to help too, Pearl?Pearl:\nYes, yes! I want to help with whatever I can!Phoenix:\n(Pearls looks like she just won the lottery...)Maya:\nOh, I'll help too, then...Elise:\n...No, it's fine. Please don't worry about it. Feel free to relax and explore the area with your friend.Maya:\nHuh!? But...Elise:\n...Oh, yes! Please take this. I think it will be of help to you. It's a map of the area. We wouldn't want you to get lost now, would we?Phoenix:\n(The \"Inner Temple\"... There it is, on the other side of the bridge...) Well, if you insist, I guess we'll take this chance to go check out the other temple.Hazakura Temple Map added to the Court Record.Pearl:\nOK! I'll see you two later then! Remember! You're not allowed to fight!Maya:\nCome on, Nick! Let's go! At least we'll stay warm if we keep moving!February 7Hazakura TempleMain GateMaya:\nHuh? Where did Sister Bikini go?Phoenix:\nI guess she went to the Inner Temple... To go help that other nun out.Maya:\nOh, right... I think her name is... Iris?Phoenix:\nY-Yeah... That was it. (I want to find out who Iris really is, but I'm scared of what I'll find...)Maya:\n...?February 7Inner Temple GateMaya:\nWhoa, that bridge was shaking like jello in an earthquake.Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nAnd at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I bet. (Changed from [And at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I'd bet.] in the original release)Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nNot to mention the last part only had like one board left on it!Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nWhat's wrong with you? Your face is all green.Phoenix:\nC-Can you not pick on me for a second? I'm still trying to get over the shock that we made it safely across that death trap.Maya:\nYeah, I guess I'm a bit surprised, too... Yikes! That \"temple\" is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse at any time... (Changed from [Yikes! That 'temple' is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse anytime...] in the original release)Phoenix:\nI guess people don't use it too often. Is this really where you're going to train tonight?Maya:\nThat has to be it. It's kinda creepy around here... Like a ghost might jump out at you or something!Phoenix:\n(A spirit medium afraid of ghosts...? Isn't it ironic, don't you think?)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI don't care how much you pay me, I don't want to cross that bridge again.\nMaya:\nNo worries, Nick. No one is offering you any money.\nPhoenix:\nThat's because no reasonable person would call that pile of popsicle sticks a bridge! The latter half of it was nothing more than a few planks of wood and some string!\nMaya:\nHey, if we want to get back, we've got no choice but to cross it again, you know.\nPhoenix:\n... Maybe I'll just stay... I've always dreamed of living in a little shack in the woods.\nMaya:\n...Wow, you really are scared, aren't you?\n\n\n\n\nSuspension wire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nIt looks like this bridge is suspended by 4 of these wires.\nPhoenix:\n...They're reeeally thin. Shouldn't they be just a little thicker...?\nMaya:\nOh, stop it! You're such a worrywart, Nick! If the bridge were really going to collapse... ...I'm pretty sure the boards would break before these wires ever did!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nWhat's wrong? You're turning into an over-ripe avocado again.\n\n\n\n\nBuddha statues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nOh, wow! Look at these neat Buddha statues. Maybe I'll take one home with me.\nPhoenix:\nMaya!\nMaya:\nBut there are so many. They wouldn't notice if I took just one.\nPhoenix:\nAre you kidding? Of course they'll notice! What are you gonna do with one of those anyway?\nMaya:\nPut it in the office of course! We can trade that wooden statue in the office reception area for one of these!\nPhoenix:\n(You know, come to think of it, where did that wooden statue come from anyway...?)\n\n\n\n\nIncinerator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nHey! There's a giant robot buried in the snow!\nPhoenix:\n... Well, there's something buried in the snow, but... I think it's an incinerator.\nMaya:\nOh... Hee hee. But you've gotta admit it looks a lot like a robot.\nPhoenix:\nUm, sure... Anyway, I don't think it gets used much. It's looking pretty rusty.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Do you think this Giant Robo-cinerator can walk?\nPhoenix:\nI told you! It's not a robot! ...And it's not especially big either.\nMaya:\nBah, you have no imagination. I thought it'd be real neat if you had to beat it to advance.\nPhoenix:\n(A fight between a lawyer and an overgrown furnace? Who'd ever pay to see that!?)\n\n\n\n\nYellow gate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nHey! A half-opened gate! That's practically a welcome mat!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, except the sign on here says, \"No Entry\".\nMaya:\nUmm, Nick. Rules are made to be broken, you know.\nPhoenix:\n...You expect a lawyer to go along with that?\nMaya:\nOh, come on! You're such an old lady sometimes! Let's just go!\nPhoenix:\nDon't blame it on me when Sister Bikini puts a curse on you.\nMaya:\n... Now you've got me scared. Um, let's just forget about it, OK?\n\n\n\n\nWooden log on left\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nLooks like there's something written on it.\nPhoenix:\nI can't read it, but if I had to take a good guess, I'd say it says, \"Inner Temple\".\nMaya:\nWhat's the point of a sign if you can't read it? Must be tough for the mailman when he's delivering here.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess the sign is a good indication of how long this place has been here...)\n\n\n\n\nGate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nSo that's the Inner Temple up ahead, huh?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks kinda run-down.\nMaya:\nWell, it wouldn't be very temple-like if it was all bright and shiny.\nPhoenix:\nSo you're training here tonight, huh?\nMaya:\nYup! Then everyone'll see my spiritual powers!\n...Uuurrrgh...ggnngh...ggh...\nPhoenix:\nSounds like your stomach wants to show off its digestive powers instead...\nMaya:\nI wonder if that roast is ready yet?February 7Inner TempleTraining HallPhoenix:\nMan, look at this place... It's just a tiny, freezing-cold room. So this is where you'll both be training, huh...Maya:\nHuh? What do you mean, \"both\"? I'm the only one.Phoenix:\nReally? But I thought...Maya:\nPearly's just a little kid. She couldn't handle this kind of intense training.Phoenix:\n(So says the girl who I can barely hear over her teeth chattering...) (Changed from [So says the girl who I can barely hear over her bones chattering...] in the original release)Maya:\nAnyway... The real training room must be behind that door over there. Hmm... Yup, definitely getting the feeling it's back there. (Changed from [Yeah, I get the feeling it's back there, definitely.] in the original release)Phoenix:\n(Even I can sense that there's something supernatural about the cavern behind that door...)

Who are you...? ...Ah! ...Phoenix:\nY-You're...Maya:\nHi there! We're just looking around since we're going to be staying here tonight...???:\n...Maya:\n...? Is something wrong????:\nUh, er, no! It-It's nothing...Maya:\nI wonder why she spaced out like that. Don't you, Nick?Phoenix:\nUh... D-Did you say something, M-Maya?Maya:\n... Not you too, Nick...Iris:\nI... M-My name is Iris. I'm one of the nuns here at this temple.Maya:\nI'm Maya Fey. It's a pleasure to meet you!Iris:\nThe pleasure is mine... ... Oh, er, please excuse me! I have some... um, chores to attend to.Maya:\nShe sure is beautiful... and a bit spacey, I guess...

Hmph... Nothing! Just a bunch of clothes. Hey, Nick.\nPhoenix:\n... Huh! Oh, sorry. I was just... thinking.\nMaya:\nOh? About Iris, I bet! Looks like you've been bitten by the love bug, Nick!\n\n\n\n\nMattresses\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere are a bunch of musty looking blankets and bedding sets piled up here. I wonder why they're even here in the first place? \nMaya:\nIt's because all spiritual training is done under the supervision of a nun. I wonder if Sister Bikini is planning to sleep in here while I train? \nPhoenix:\n(But if they sleep, what's the point of having them here in the first place...?)\n\n\n\n\nSacred cavern entrance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nThe actual training area must be on the other side of this door. I wonder what it's like. Phooey... It's locked. Come on, Nick! You know you want to open it for me!\nPhoenix:\n...I can't.\nMaya:\n...

The Master of the Kurain School of Channeling...\nPhoenix:\nAre... Are you sure?\nMaya:\nYes... The crest at the top of the scroll... That's the special mark of the Master of our tradition.\nPhoenix:\n(So that's what the mark means...)\nMaya:\n...\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it?\nMaya:\nN-Nothing... It's just that...

Didn't you go to college? ...And maybe enroll with the Ivy University Literature Department?\nIris:\nNo, I never had an interest in going to a big university like that... My training is all the education I need.\nPhoenix:\nI... I see...\nIris:\nBut... Once in a while, when I get the chance, I make a trip to the nearby town. I can use a computer and a cell phone, too.\nPhoenix:\n... (That's not exactly something worth bragging about... But I don't see any Psyche-Locks... ...so I guess that means she's not lying...)\nIris:\nP-Please don't stare at me like that...\n\n\n\n\nHazakura Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of a place is this anyway? I heard it's for training to increase your spiritual power or something like that.\nIris:\nIt must seem awfully crazy to normal people like you.\nPhoenix:\nWell, I have to admit it is a whole different world up here...\nIris:\nI'm glad to hear you say that.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nIris:\nTalking with dead people... Who does it help anyway? ...I hate it.\nPhoenix:\nR-Really? (So then why stay in a place like this...?)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Instead of showing her things, I really need to just listen to her story! This girl... Just who is she?)After clearing all Talk options:Iris:\nAh...Phoenix:\nIs something wrong?Iris:\nI-I didn't realize it was so late. I have to go and ring the bell for lights out...Phoenix:\n(I guess it's almost 10:00 now, huh?)Iris:\n... Um... Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n...Yes?Iris:\nIf it's alright with you... I would like you to have this.Phoenix:\nBut this is your hood...Iris:\nIt has the power to protect you from evil spirits.Phoenix:\n(Come to think of it, Sister Bikini was wearing one of these, too...)Iris:\nI pray for your safety on this dark, cold night.Iris's Hood received from Iris.Iris:\nI'm sorry, but I must bid you goodnight.Phoenix:\nWait a minute, Sister Iris...Iris:\nY-Yes...?Phoenix:\nJust now, you called me by my name... You said, \"Mr. Wright\". How did you know my name? I never introduced myself to you.Iris:\nTh-That's...Phoenix:\n...Sister Iris. Please, tell me the truth. You and I... Have we ever met before?Iris:\n...5 PSYCHE-LOCKSPhoenix:\nI-Iris...Iris:\nO-Oh! It-It's almost 10:00... Perhaps we can speak again... tomorrow.*gong* *gong* *gong*Phoenix:\n(So my hunch was correct... She does know me...

On the ground...!) M-Ms. Deauxniiiiiim!...*squish*Phoenix:\n(...I just stepped on something soft.)Bikini:\nHey! Don't step on my tummy like that!Phoenix:\nWh-What are you doing lying there in the snow!?Bikini:\nI was passed out! What do you think!?Phoenix:\nSo that blood-curdling scream was you...?Bikini:\nF-Forget about that! H-Hurry up and call the police!Phoenix:\nIs there even a phone in the Main Hall?Bikini:\nNo, but we still get reception up here in the mountains! You must have a cell phone on you, right!?Phoenix:\nI, um... I didn't bring it with me--Bikini:\nOh, you're useless! I mean, even Iris has a cell phone... We've got no choice! You'll have to use the public phone by Dusky Bridge! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Run as fast as you can!Phoenix:\nY-Yes, ma'am...Bikini:\nIf you don't hurry, Iris will... Iris will...!February 7, 11:18 PMDusky BridgePhoenix:\n...*huff*...*huff*... (It's farther than I thought. The bridge is just up ahead. I have to go tell Maya what happened, too!) ............ ...Aaaaaaaaaah! Dusky Bridge...! It's burning down! (What the heck happened!?)Butz:\nWhat are you doing here?Phoenix:\nAaaaaaaaah!Butz:\nHuh? What is it? Is it me?Phoenix:\nD-Don't scare me like that, Larry! I almost had a heart attack!Butz:\nMy name isn't Larry! It's Laurice!Phoenix:\nLarry, hurry up and call the police! I'm going to the Inner Temple!Butz:\nD-Don't be stupid! The bridge is nothing but a burning wreck right now!Phoenix:\nListen to me! There's been a murder! Here! At Hazakura Temple!Butz:\nWha-Whaaaaat!?Phoenix:\nThe murderer might have fled across the bridge! I have to make sure Maya is safe!Butz:\nB-B-But...Phoenix:\nPlease! Call the police! I've got to go! ...Get outta my way, Larry!Butz:\nIt-It's too dangerous! Nick, w-wait!Phoenix:\n(I must have been crazy... I knew how dangerous it was, but I still went for it...)...*crack!*...Phoenix:\nAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!Butz:\nNiiiiiick----!Phoenix:\n(Weakened even more by the fire, the rickety old bridge's planks snapped and gave way. And as I was swallowed by the eternal darkness that surrounded me... ...a final, terrified scream rose up to pierce the frozen air of that harrowing night.)To be continued.Date: ???

It's an emergency!Edgeworth:\n...Huh? Larry...? Do you know what time it is?Butz:\nIt's not \"Larry\"! It's \"Laurice\"! Laurice Deauxnim!Edgeworth:\n(... This is nothing more than a terrible nightmare... I'll just roll over and...)Butz:\nW-Wait! Don't hang up! ...It's an emergency! It's Nick! H-He... He took a really nasty spill!Edgeworth:\nWell, it wouldn't be the first time, so...Butz:\nI'm not joking! His life is in danger!Edgeworth:\nWh-What...!? What happened!? Tell me!Butz:\nTalk about a guy with bad luck! He may already be dead! Anyway, you've got to come back! You're the only one that can help! My Iris... My beautiful Iris! She needs help...!Edgeworth:\nAlright. I don't know what's going on, but... I'll be there as soon as I can.Butz:\nI-I'm at the detention center! Please! Hurryyyyyy!Phone:\n...*beep*...Edgeworth:\n(It's been one year since I left that country... I thought I wouldn't have to see him again for a while... Sounds like it won't be a pretty reunion... As if I expected anything to change.)February 8, 2:19 PMDetention CenterVisitor's RoomButz:\nYou're late, Edgey! What took you so long!?Edgeworth:\nI don't want to hear it! I chartered a private jet to come as quickly as I could!Butz:\nWell, you should've chartered a faster one! Anyway, just listen! Something happened to Ms. Elise... and Nick is... Maya... and Iris's Bikini... ...Huh? Say something, Edgey!Edgeworth:\n...Before I came here, I stopped in at the hospital where Wright is. I believe I have a better understanding of the situation than you, at this point. The murder victim was the picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. She was found by Wright and the head nun. The suspect is the temple's younger nun. Then later, while Wright was crossing the bridge, it broke and he fell into the river. The hospital says that he'll need at least 2 days of bed rest.Butz:\nY-Yes! Th-That's right! You got it! B-But they arrested her... My sweet little Iris!Edgeworth:\n(And here I was, convinced HE was the one the police had arrested...) However... I still don't understand what these two items are for.Butz:\nWhat are you talking about?Edgeworth:\nThey're things Wright gave to me when I was leaving his room. (This is the first... He said some nonsense about being able to see into people's hearts with this... And the other... He couldn't possibly be asking what I think he is... could he?)Butz:\nI'm begging you! Iris's trial starts tomorrow! With Nick out of the picture, you're all I've got left! You're the only one that can represent her!Edgeworth:\n... What did you just say?Butz:\nYou know! REPRESENT! DEFEND! What were you expecting!? Why do you think I called you anyway!?Edgeworth:\n...I'm a prosecutor, Larry. A prosecutor. Do YOU understand what I'm saying? A prosecutor is a lawyer who...Butz:\nDon't talk to me like a kid! I graduated from junior high, you know! Don't worry about it! I promise I won't tell!Edgeworth:\nBut I...Butz:\nI mean, I heard a paper badge had no problem fooling an entire court before!Edgeworth:\n(...How could this country's judicial system have fallen into such decay!?)Butz:\nPlease, Edgey! At least listen to her... Listen to Iris's side of the story!Edgeworth:\n(So Wright wasn't joking when he gave me this badge after all...)Iris:\nThank you for coming. ...My name is Iris.Edgeworth:\n...Edgeworth. Miles Edgeworth. I don't know if I can be of any help, but... ...I will at least hear what you have to say. ...About the murder.Iris:\nUm...Edgeworth:\n...?Iris:\nM-Mr. Wright! H-H-How is he? Mr. Laurice said that he... That he might even die...Edgeworth:\n... Fortunately, he will be fine. (Larry, you moron! How could you say something like that!?) He was badly bruised when he hit the water, but otherwise he is unharmed.Iris:\n... Thank goodness...Edgeworth:\nBut, he's caught some kind of nasty cold.Iris:\nA cold...?Edgeworth:\nHe's running a high fever and is drifting in and out of consciousness.Iris:\n...Edgeworth:\n(I must be imagining things. This woman... I feel like I've met her before...)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurveillance camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe camera is glaring at me. \"If something glares at you, it's only polite to return the favor,\" is what I was taught. ...\nIris:\nUm... Is something bothering you?\nEdgeworth:\n...Hm? Oh, e-excuse me.\n\n\n\n\nGuard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe guard is glaring at me. \"If something glares at you, it's only polite to return the favor,\" is what I was taught. ...\nIris:\nUm... Are you alright, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n...Hm? Oh, e-excuse me.Move\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Going to a crime scene is akin to entering a jungle teeming with dangerous beasts. Before he goes there, a hunter needs to make sure he has plenty of ammunition. And in my case, that \nammunition is called, \"information\".Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nPardon me... Iris. I would like to ask you something, if you don't mind. I have the distinct feeling you and I have met before...\nIris:\nI-It must be your imagination, Mr. Edgeworth. After all... I hardly ever leave Hazakura Temple.\nEdgeworth:\nHazakura Temple? What's that?\nIris:\nIt's a place where those who wish to boost their spiritual power come to train. You need to undergo some very difficult training to release your inner spiritual power.\nEdgeworth:\nSpiritual power...? Did you go to that temple for that reason as well?\nIris:\nNo... I don't have any spiritual powers. I don't need them.\nEdgeworth:\nIn that case, what are you doing at that temple then?\nIris:\n... I... I've committed some sins. Sins that I need to pay for. That's why I'm there, and why I continue to train... To purify my soul.\n\n\n\n\nThe night of the crime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI want to ask you about last night... The night of the crime.\nIris:\nAlright... I helped to clean up after dinner, and then went back to my room at about 8:00. Later, I left my room to ring the lights out bell at 10:00.\nEdgeworth:\nBell...?\nIris:\n...We ring it at the same time each night.\nEdgeworth:\nI see... And then?\nIris:\nA-And then...\nEdgeworth:\n...?\nIris:\nI was told to go to the Training Hall, but... I went back to my room... and stayed there...\nEdgeworth:\nWhy didn't you go to the Training Hall like you were asked to?\nIris:\n...I-I was frightened.\nEdgeworth:\n(\"Frightened\"...?)\nIris:\nSo I just stayed in my room and meditated... until the murder happened.\nEdgeworth:\n(There's more to her story.  I just know there is. Maybe  I should dig a little deeper.)\n\n\n\n\nFrightened? (appears after \"The night of the crime\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou were asked to go to the Training Hall on the night of the murder?\nIris:\nYes...\nEdgeworth:\nHowever... You didn't go. Because you say you were frightened. What exactly were you so frightened of?\nIris:\n...!\n\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Wh-What in the world!?)\nIris:\nUm... Is there something wrong?\nEdgeworth:\n...I'm sorry. It's nothing. (It looks like she's not aware of them herself... These must be what Wright was talking about... The \"Psycholocks\"! I believe he said that I need to present this \"Magatama\" item to do something...)\nIris:\n...?\n\n\n\n\nFrightened? (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nI... I don't like to walk alone at night. And, last night was...\nEdgeworth:\nWhat about last night?\n\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n\nIris:\nEr, oh... nothing. It's rather silly...\nEdgeworth:\nSo there was something special about last night, hmm?\nIris:\nNngh...\nEdgeworth:\n(It looks like I have no choice but to break these locks...)\n\n\n\n\nAny idea? (before clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night?\nIris:\n...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed.\nEdgeworth:\nSpiritual power...?\nIris:\nYes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example...\nEdgeworth:\n...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science. I don't believe in \"spiritual power\".\nIris:\nYes... I understand. Most people don't.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd I am certain that the thing that killed the victim was a human. So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim?\nIris:\n... No. I'm not the one who took her life.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... (That was foolish of me... It's not as if I can know for certain if she is telling me the truth...)\n\n\n\n\nAny idea? (after clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night?\nIris:\n...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed.\nEdgeworth:\nSpiritual power...?\nIris:\nYes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example...\nEdgeworth:\n...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science.

So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim?\nIris:\n... No. I'm not the one who took her life.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... (Those Psycholock things aren't appearing... I suppose that means I can believe that she's not lying.) ...Heh.\nIris:\nWhat's wrong?\nEdgeworth:\n(I can't believe what I'm thinking... And here I just finished saying that I don't believe in spiritual power...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nIs that an attorney's badge?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, this belongs to Wright.\nIris:\nReally?\nEdgeworth:\nI'm actually a prosecutor.\nIris:\nOh...! Then why do you have a defense attorney's badge pinned on your lapel...?\nEdgeworth:\nWell, you see... I, um... I borrowed it.\n\n\n\n\nHanging Scroll\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWho is the woman on this hanging scroll?\nIris:\nWell, I don't know the details, but... I've heard she's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique.\nEdgeworth:\nM-Master?\nIris:\nYes. Mystic Misty. She was a great spirit medium. ...That's what I've heard. I also heard that she went missing over 15 years ago.\nEdgeworth:\n... Spirit mediums... There's no such thing anyway...\nIris:\nMr. Edgeworth...?\nEdgeworth:\nI know all about them... They're nothing but frauds!\nIris:\n...?\nEdgeworth:\n(She doesn't know anything about it, of course... But there was a time, 17 years ago, when I met the \"Master\" myself...)\n\n\n\n\nIris's Hood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nThat's called a \"Demon-Warding Hood\". ...I gave that to Mr. Wright last night.\nEdgeworth:\nHe was wearing this when I saw him at the hospital today.\nIris:\nIt's an important item for protecting acolytes from evil spirits.\nEdgeworth:\nIf it's so important, then why did you give it to him?\nIris:\nLast night... I felt... something... I felt that something terrible was about to happen... I... I didn't want Mr. Wright to fall into its grip.\nEdgeworth:\n(Well he wound up falling into something much deeper and colder... I probably shouldn't say that out loud, though. Thank god for inner monologue.)\n\n\n\n\n\"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\n...I was against the idea of our temple appearing in that magazine. I was afraid that... this type of a tragedy might occur.\nEdgeworth:\nIn that case, why did you allow them to run an article about you?\nIris:\nIt was Sister Bikini... She's actually rather fond of attention... Surprisingly so.\nEdgeworth:\n(She certainly does look rather happy in this photo...)\n\n\n\n\nPhoto of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nThat's Mystic Elise Deauxnim. She's a picture book author, or so I've heard.\nEdgeworth:\nDoes she come to Hazakura Temple often...?\nIris:\nNo... This was her first time. It's just that...\nEdgeworth:\n...?\nIris:\nShe was a very important visitor.\nEdgeworth:\nIs that so?\nIris:\nYes, Sister Bikini told me, \"Be certain not to offend her.\"\nEdgeworth:\n(The victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim... The prosecutor's office still doesn't have much information about her it seems...)\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix Wright profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nMr. Wright... How bad is his cold?\nEdgeworth:\nWell his fever is very high. As a result, he's rather confused. He's worried about Maya, who is still trapped in the Inner Temple... ...And he's quite worried about you as well, it seems.\nIris:\n...Really?\nEdgeworth:\nYes... Naturally, once he recovers, I'll pass the baton back to him.\nIris:\nNo... Don't... I'm sure that Mr. Wright wouldn't want that... He wouldn't want to defend me.\n\n\n\n\nLarry Butz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nOh... That's Mr. Laurice.\nEdgeworth:\n...I'm sorry? Who did you say it was?\nIris:\nLaurice Deauxnim. He is Mystic Elise's apprentice, I think.\nEdgeworth:\n(Alright... Now who exactly is this guy...?)\nIris:\nHe's a very sincere, hard-working person.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nIris:\nUm... Did I say something wrong, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nE-Excuse me. I was temporarily at a loss for words. (Take a trip... Come home... Be thrust suddenly into bizarro world...)\n\n\n\n\nIris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nYou want to know about me? There's not much to tell, I'm afraid.\nEdgeworth:\nJust let me get one thing straight. You were raised at Hazakura Temple, correct? And yet, somehow, you seem to know Wright.\nIris:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nSo you two must have crossed paths somewhere.\nIris:\n...No, Mr. Edgeworth. Whomever it was... ...it couldn't have been me.\nEdgeworth:\n(What is that supposed to mean?)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nI'm sorry... I don't leave the temple grounds very often... So I don't know very much about the outside world.After clearing all Talk options:Edgeworth:\nHmm... It appears that's about all that you can tell me.Iris:\nThank you very much for listening to my story.Edgeworth:\n...I visited Wright at the hospital before coming here. He asked me to take care of you...Iris:\n...M-Me?Edgeworth:\nYes, at the trial tomorrow... He asked me to defend you.Iris:\n... If Mr. Wright has that much faith in you, Mr. Edgeworth... ...Then I will gladly entrust my fate in your capable hands.Edgeworth:\nBut before that, I have one question.Iris:\nYes?Edgeworth:\nDo you know Wright?Iris:\nEr... Wh-Why would you ask that?Edgeworth:\nWhenever you came up in our conversation, he would begin to act a little... strange.Iris:\n... Mr. Edgeworth... What is Mr. Wright to you? (Changed from [Mr. Edgeworth... Are you his friend?] in the original release)Edgeworth:\n...He is a very dear and indispensable friend. (Changed from [Friend? Well... In a sense, yes.] in the original release)Iris:\n... It was 5 years ago... That's when I... That's when I... deceived him.Edgeworth:\nYou \"deceived\" him...?Iris:\nI heard that he was... in a lot of pain after what happened. I know what a weak person I am. That's why... That's why I thought it was best if he never saw me again. I wanted him to just forget about me, without learning the truth.Edgeworth:\n... Well, if you ask me, Wright is still suffering... And until he learns the truth, I don't think he will ever be able to truly recover. ...Iris. It's not too late. You should go to him. ...Tell him the truth.Iris:\n...Edgeworth:\nI'll defend you, but only if you agree to that one condition.Iris:\n... Alright, Mr. Edgeworth... I promise.Edgeworth:\n...Very well. I'll do everything in my power to get you an acquittal. (That's enough information gathering for now. I should head to the crime scene...)February 8Dusky BridgeEdgeworth:\n(It sure is cold alright... So this is it... Dusky Bridge...)???:\nOh, wow! It's you, Mr. Edgeworth! (Changed from [Ahem! M-Mr. Edgeworth!] in the original release)Edgeworth:\nNngh... Detective Gumshoe. (Changed from [Urk... Detective Gumshoe.] in the original release)Gumshoe:\nLong time no see! It's been about a year? ...Or has it been longer?Edgeworth:\nIt doesn't matter, Detective. What does matter is why you're shuffling around up here.Gumshoe:\nOh, ouch! ...And there's that sharp left jab! (Changed from [Oh, ouch! ...And there was a sharp left jab!] in the original release) Well, I'm happy to see you anyway, Mr. Edgeworth!Edgeworth:\nLet me guess... You were transferred by HR to the local precinct? (Changed from [Let me guess... You were transferred into another section at work.] in the original release) A wise decision. The vast amount of nothing up here should be quite easy to guard. (Changed from [A good choice. The vast amount of nothing up here must be quite easy to guard.] in the original release)Gumshoe:\nI heard you were back in the country and arranged to come all the way out here! Everybody was real nice. They even let me take charge of the investigation, sir.Edgeworth:\n(...Gumshoe indeed! Like gum on your shoe, he's impossible to get rid of!)Gumshoe:\nI'm supposed to report on the details of the crime scene, sir! Anyway! Here I am! Detective Dick Gumshoe! Reporting for duty!Edgeworth:\n...Great. Um, thank you, Detective.Gumshoe:\nI thought Prosecutor Godot was gonna get here before me. That guy's a real mystery, I tell you!Edgeworth:\n(...Prosecutor Godot?)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCliff on other side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt looks like a pretty good distance to that far cliff.\nGumshoe:\nYeah... It's gotta be around 100 yards or so.\nEdgeworth:\n... Detective... That's not even CLOSE to a hundred yards.\nGumshoe:\nWell... I gotta admit I'm not very good at judging distances.\nEdgeworth:\n(It's about 20 yards or so. And impossible to cross without a bridge, it seems...)\n\n\n\n\nWooden sign on left side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThere's a little shack down that way called, \"Heavenly Hall\".\nEdgeworth:\nA shack...?\nGumshoe:\nIt's like a run-down doghouse for losers that can't bear the freezing drafts of wind... Kinda reminds me of my apartment, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nThe name \"Heavenly Hall\" makes it sound like a palace...\nGumshoe:\nGiving a hovel a great name is a crime itself! I'd call it false advertising! By the way, the name of my apartment complex is \"Compton Castles\"...\nEdgeworth:\n...That's not such a great name, if you ask me.\nGumshoe:\nWell, it's not such a great apartment either, sir.\n\n\n\n\nBridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo this is the bridge Wright tried to cross?\nGumshoe:\nPretty reckless, if you ask me.\nEdgeworth:\nI'm amazed he survived the fall from up here...\nGumshoe:\nYeah, he's one lucky guy, sir. Now I see how he manages to win his cases in court. Blind luck.\nEdgeworth:\n(I think dumb luck suits Wright just a bit better.)\n\n\n\n\nBoulder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSome letters are wildly engraved into a roughly cut boulder. \"Dusky Bridge\"... It certainly is an appropriate name.\nGumshoe:\nYou need to get some glasses, Mr. Edgeworth! That sign says, \"Dusty Bridge\". I can see how you read it wrong, though, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nYou're the one who needs glasses, Detective. Try reading it one more time.\nGumshoe:\n... Ah! You're right! It's \"Dusky Bridge\" after all! ... I guess whoever wrote this made a mistake!\n\n\n\n\nPublic phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nHey! It's a public phone! You don't see a lot of these anymore!\nEdgeworth:\n...That's true.\nGumshoe:\nSince we've got one here, why don't we take a photo as a memento!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, um, sure. Why not?\nGumshoe:\nOh, darn it! I don't have a camera with me! ...I'm gonna go buy a disposable camera! I'll be right back, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n(What's so special about public phones, and why is he so fascinated by them...?)Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened (before visitng Main Hall)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case...\nGumshoe:\nIt's simple!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, simple is as simple does, as they say.\nGumshoe:\nOh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing!\nEdgeworth:\nA witness...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that Bikini lady.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Bikini lady\"? Here? On this freezing cold mountain?\nGumshoe:\n...Well, you should talk to her yourself if you want the details, sir.\nEdgeworth:\n(I may have to talk to this \"bikini lady\"... I mean, \"decisive witness\" myself...)\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened (after visitng Main Hall)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case...\nGumshoe:\nIt's simple!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, simple is as simple does, as they say.\nGumshoe:\nOh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing!\nEdgeworth:\nA witness...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that Bikini lady.\n\n\n\n\nDusky Bridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo this is the bridge that Wright fell through?\nGumshoe:\nYup! I can't imagine being that reckless myself... \"Look before you cross,\" is how it goes, right? Or was that \"leap\"...?\nEdgeworth:\nAnd? Is there something on the other side?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, some old building they call the Inner Temple... But we can't get over there without a bridge, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat...?\nGumshoe:\nNobody lives there, so it's usually not a problem... But someone was at the Inner Temple doing some training and now they're stuck there.\nEdgeworth:\nYes, I heard that from Wright. It's Maya Fey.\nGumshoe:\nOh no... Her again...? Anyway, the air's really turbulent right now so we can't do an aerial extraction. No one's gonna be able to reach the Inner Temple until tomorrow, sir.\nEdgeworth:\n(Will she be alright in this cold...?) So how did this bridge burn down anyway?\nGumshoe:\nWe're almost 100% sure it was lightning.\nEdgeworth:\n...Lightning?\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor Godot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo who is this Prosecutor Godot? I've never heard of him.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, he's a new guy... Showed up after you left the country! He's a complete rookie, but nobody can say a bad word about the guy.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat kind of a man is he?\nGumshoe:\nHe just became a prosecutor recently, but he's good, sir. Real good.\nEdgeworth:\n(If he's so good, how is it that I've never heard of him...?) Is he the lead prosecutor on this case?\nGumshoe:\nYou bet he is! After all, \"you know who\" is right in the middle of it.\nEdgeworth:\n\"You know who\"?\nGumshoe:\nPhoenix Wright, of course! For some reason, Godot has really got it in for Mr. Wright!\nEdgeworth:\nOh?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, he seems to have some kind of a grudge.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd what would be the cause of this grudge...?\nGumshoe:\nI dunno... Maybe he made fun of his mask or something.\nEdgeworth:\n(None of this is making any sense. I'd better look into this Godot myself.)\n\n\n\n\nLightning (appears after \"Dusky Bridge\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning?\nGumshoe:\nYup. Last night it snowed for the first time in 3 days. It's a little unusual for lightning to occur during a snow fall like that... But according to the weather data, lightning definitely struck.\nWeather Data added to the Court Record.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm, I see... This is a very detailed weather report... Almost too detailed... It even has the exact time that the lightning struck the bridge...\nGumshoe:\nOh, that? We got that information from the witness's testimony.\nEdgeworth:\nSomeone actually saw the lightning hit the bridge? Who is this witness?\nGumshoe:\n... Sorry. I'll go ask one of the local cops later, sir.\n\n\n\n\nLightning (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning?\nGumshoe:\nYup.

What's that thing doing on your lapel, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n...Is it really that odd?\nGumshoe:\nYou bet it is, sir! A prosecutor wearing a defense attorney's badge? That's like a detective with a license to kill!\nEdgeworth:\n(Does this little thing hold that ominous of a meaning...?)\n\n\n\n\nMagatama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHave you ever seen this thing before...?\nGumshoe:\nHey, thanks a lot. I was getting kind of hungry! ...*chomp!*\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What are you doing, Detective!?\nGumshoe:\nAck! ...I thought it was some kind of candy that would fill me up, sir. Lately I've been feeling so hungry all the time...\nEdgeworth:\n(Nngh... Maybe his salary has been cut just a little too much...?)\n\n\n\n\nPhoto of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThere's a lot we don't know about this victim... We don't know her real name, her background... We don't know anything really.\nEdgeworth:\nThat's rather odd... If she was trying to hide her identity, why would she become an author?\nGumshoe:\nI'll bet it was just one of those things. You know... She probably never expected to get so popular.\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix Wright profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nWhenever something happens, this guy always shows up like he hasn't got a care. In fact, you know what...? Every time he shows up, I always wonder the same thing. \"Maybe somehow he's actually the cause of all these incidents!\"\nEdgeworth:\n(I wonder if Gumshoe has realized it yet... But you could say the exact the same thing about him!)\n\n\n\n\nDick Gumshoe profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYour face is more drawn out than the last time I saw you over a year ago.\nGumshoe:\nR-Really? I thought so!\nEdgeworth:\nNo, wait... It's not so much \"drawn out\", as \"weary and tired\", or maybe just plain old \"thin\".\nGumshoe:\nI thought that too, sir. My salary's been kinda on the low end... So yeah, my food options have been kinda non-existent. Off-brand chicken soup, off-brand spaghetti, off-brand bread... That sort of stuff.\nEdgeworth:\nI thought you were really into instant noodles last year...?\nGumshoe:\n...I got really sick of the stuff after a while, sir.\n\n\n\n\nLarry Butz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nHe's supposed to be Ms. Elise Deauxnim's apprentice or something.\nEdgeworth:\n...I see.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, he drew a nice portrait of me.\nEdgeworth:\n...That's nice.\nGumshoe:\nBut he made me pay him 50 cents for it.\nEdgeworth:\n...I'm sorry about that.\nGumshoe:\n... You don't seem very interested in him, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\n...I really don't want to talk about him. That's why.\n\n\n\n\nIris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI feel like I've seen this girl somewhere before! She wasn't from a prior case, was she?\nGumshoe:\nNope, can't be. We did a database search with her fingerprints and came up with nothing.\nEdgeworth:\nI see... (I just can't shake this nagging feeling...)\nGumshoe:\nWell, everyone knows that you are quite popular with the ladies, sir... Maybe she's an old girlfriend that you sent to Dumpsville when you were younger.\nEdgeworth:\nD-Detective! Where did you hear such nonsense from!?\nGumshoe:\nI didn't hear it from anyone. It's just sorta how I imagine you to be... sir.\nEdgeworth:\n(...D-Do I really inspire this sort of frothing desire from the female masses?)\n\n\n\n\nGodot profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI usually hear about promising young prosecutor candidates while they're still in school. But I've never seen or heard of this person.\nGumshoe:\nI gotta admit... He's puzzling alright. He just appeared one day, big mug of steaming coffee in his hand...\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... He sounds like an interesting man...\nGumshoe:\nYeah... The whole prosecutor's office is really into double espresso macchiatos lately.\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nLook, I'm just your everyday, simple detective. Don't ask me such tough questions, OK?\nEdgeworth:\n...That's not something to be proud of, Detective!February 8Detention CenterVisitor's RoomEdgeworth:\n(It looks like Iris is being interrogated right now.) ...This place certainly brings back memories.Gumshoe:\nOh yeah. Come to think of it, you got thrown in here once too, didn't you, sir? But you know what? I've never been in jail a single time!Edgeworth:\n(I should think it's hard to land in jail when you're so harmless...) Yes, well... If you're in jail, you don't have to pay for your own meals, you know.Gumshoe:\n...*gasp!* ...Edgeworth:\nDon't get any funny ideas, Detective...!Gumshoe:\n...Too late, I already did.Edgeworth:\n(In any case... I guess I'll have to come back here later...)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurveillance camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThat camera is meant to monitor everything that happens in here. And right now, it's pointed straight at the guard.\n\n\n\n\nGuard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe guard is staring at me with a puzzled expression on his face. Me... and the badge on my lapel. ...I get the feeling he recognizes me.February 8Hazakura TempleMain GateButz:\nYo! Edgey! What took you so long!? I'm so cold, my brain's turned to sherbet.Edgeworth:\n...I knew it was a mistake to race back to this country.Butz:\nWh-What do you mean...?Edgeworth:\nWright is going to be fine, and the case itself isn't anything unusual...

I just know it, OK!? So trust me on this one!Edgeworth:\nEver the romantic, aren't you, Larry? Nevertheless, I'll do whatever I can to prove her innocence.

Like a fine wine, it gets better with age!\nEdgeworth:\nEven fine wine turns to vinegar and begins to stink at some point. ...I suggest you wash that atrocious rag you call a coat, Detective.\n\n\n\n\nMain Hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThat must be the Main Hall back there.\nGumshoe:\nA brilliant deduction, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n............

There's something I've always wondered about...\nEdgeworth:\n(Something tells me he's going to tell me what's on his mind, whether I like it or not...)\nGumshoe:\nWe call a person who tells a lie a \"liar\", right? So why don't we call a person who rings a bell a \"beller\"? Or \"truer\" for a guy who tells the truth!

After all, I saved his life.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is that supposed to mean?\nButz:\nIf I hadn't called for help so quickly, he would have died. It's no surprise though. I used to be a security guard.

Why didn't you tell me that earlier!? This is exactly why your salary keeps on getting cut!Gumshoe:\nNngh... My stomach is already growling in protest...Bikini:\nSo... Um...

I want to hear what you know.Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWalls or sliding doors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere's flowing script written everywhere on the walls.\nGumshoe:\nMan, I'd bet you'd have awful nightmares if you tried to sleep in here.\nBikini:\nThis is our Main Hall, so it's protected by a variety of magic spells and charms... They're all designed to prevent evil forces from entering.\nGumshoe:\nSo if I slept here the uggie-woogie-boogieman wouldn't hunt me down for eternity?

But where are all the cats?\nEdgeworth:\n...It's called a \"hibachi\". It's for heating the room.\nGumshoe:\nOh! Look at all these ancient straw frisbees!\nEdgeworth:\nThose are a type of \"zabuton\" cushions called \"enza\"!\nGumshoe:\n... Why are you giving me such a hard time? Huh, Mr. Edgeworth? Why?\nEdgeworth:\nBecause learning something new might actually be a good thing for you, Detective!\n\n\n\n\nAltar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt's an altar with a giant Magatama enshrined on it.\nGumshoe:\nThere are lots of candles lined up on it, too. You know... I haven't had a birthday party for myself in a while...\nEdgeworth:\nMaybe you should blow out those candles over there to make up for that.\nGumshoe:\nMr. Edgeworth? Would you mind singing \"Happy Birthday\" to me?\nBikini:\nS-Stop that! Cut that out! Please don't blow out the altar candles!\n\n\n\n\nMagatama on altar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...That thing sure casts a strong presence over the whole room.\nBikini:\nThis is the \"Lesser Magatama\". It's a precious heirloom containing a great many souls.\nGumshoe:\nHuh...!? This is \"lesser\"!? What is the \"greater\" one like?\nBikini:\nThe \"Greater Magatama\" is displayed in the Main Room of Fey Manor. It was supposed to be shown at the Treasures of Kurain exhibit... But, it was so large that they couldn't bring it through the doors.\n\n\n\n\nLeft corner near altar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(There are more enza cushions in the corner of the room.) ...What's that white piece of paper sticking out from under that stack...?\nGumshoe:\nHmm...

An ultra important clue! A super-special clue!\nEdgeworth:\n...I suppose I should read it myself then.\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like a letter addressed to Sister Iris. \"tonight at 10 at Heavenly Hall. ... ...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed.\"\nEdgeworth:\nTh-This sounds like a blackmail letter...!\nNote to Iris added to the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\nNice going there, Mr. Edgeworth! Why can't I ever find clues like that!? You're an ultra-important prosecutor!!

After dinner, the two of us went to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple.\nEdgeworth:\n(She must be talking about Maya...) Approximately what time was that...?\nBikini:\nI suppose it was about 9:00 when we left here. Training lasts all night long. It's extremely exhausting. The channeling dojo's Head Nun must be in attendance at all times to keep watch.\nGumshoe:\nWow, you're right! That does sound exhausting!\nEdgeworth:\nDetective, this is no time for flattery.\nGumshoe:\nSorry.\nEdgeworth:\nSome time around 11:00, you witnessed the incident in the courtyard. But your duty was in the Inner Temple. Why did you come back here?\nBikini:\nHmm... The way you're staring at me, I'm starting to get goosebumps! Ha ha ha ho ho!\nEdgeworth:\n(Nngh... I'm starting to get goosebumps myself, but for a decidedly different reason.)\nGumshoe:\nHo ho, you get the chills pretty easy, don't you Mr. Edgeworth?\n\n\n\n\nWhat you saw\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAlright then... I'd like you to tell me exactly what you saw in the courtyard.\nBikini:\nIt must have been past 11:00. Ah! No! I can't say it! It-It's too much for my poor heart!\nGumshoe:\nHey! Calm down, lady! L-Let go of my tie!\nBikini:\n...I saw two people! One of them was lying on the ground... Th-The other one was stabbing her from the back... with a sword!\nEdgeworth:\nDid you see this criminal with your own eyes?\nBikini:\nI didn't want to believe what I was seeing...! ...But it was Iris!\nEdgeworth:\nYou must have been quite shocked.\nGumshoe:\nOf course she was! Try putting yourself in her shoes! It'd be like if you were stabbing Mr. Wright smack in the middle of a courtroom! And I happened to witness it from the witness stand! ...I'd be pretty shocked too.\nBikini:\nI know it sounds insane... But that's what I saw. And when I finally realized what I was seeing, I screamed, and then... I passed out.\nEdgeworth:\n(...Unfortunately for us, her testimony seems to be pretty solid.)\nBikini:\nHowever... The idea of Iris doing such a foul act seems... unnatural.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Unnatural\"...?\nBikini:\nThe girl I know simply isn't capable of this sort of foulness...\nEdgeworth:\n(...I wonder what she means by that?)\n\n\n\n\nWhy return? (appears after \"The night of the crime\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAs the head nun, it's your duty to stay with the acolyte at all times, correct?\nBikini:\nYes, that's correct. I know I may look strong, but the truth is... I've got a bad lower back.\nEdgeworth:\nA bad lower back...?\nBikini:\nYes, it's especially bad in the winter. So bad that I can't even lift a bucket. Do you remember how cold it was last night? My bad back felt as stiff as frozen glass. I just wanted to take a nice hot bath to ease my aching back... That's why I returned to the Main Hall.\nEdgeworth:\nSo you left the disciple all alone?\nBikini:\nDon't be ridiculous! I would never do that! That's why I ordered Iris to the Inner Temple after she had rung the bell for lights out.\nEdgeworth:\n(Yes, but she never went to the Inner Temple, did she? So did this head nun actually see Iris there? (Changed from [Did this head nun even see Iris?] in the original release) I think I'd better try to get some more details...)\n\n\n\n\nThe acolyte (appears after \"What you saw\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo who is this acolyte that was to train at the Inner Temple...?\nBikini:\nHer name is Maya Fey... I treated her very badly, I'm ashamed to say. And after she went through the trouble of signing up for the Special Course...\nGumshoe:\n\"Special Course\"?\nBikini:\nIt's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant 30,000 times...\nEdgeworth:\nYou don't mean to tell me she's still doing that over at the Inner Temple, do you?\nBikini:\nNo, no, no. Of course not! You don't have to worry about that one little bit. Last night, we still hadn't started the training session itself.\nEdgeworth:\nWell, um... That's good to hear.\nBikini:\n...Oh! Dear, dear! There's one thing I forgot to tell you.\nGumshoe:\n...Uh-oh, I don't think I like the sound of this.\nBikini:\nDo you know that small girl? I believe she is Mystic Maya's little sister.\nEdgeworth:\n(Maya has a little sister...?)\nGumshoe:\nOh, you mean little Pearl! That's Maya Fey's cousin.\nEdgeworth:\nLittle... Pearl...?\nBikini:\nI thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after we'd finished with dinner cleanup... (Changed from [I thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after cleaning up dinner...] in the original release) But I haven't seen her at all since late last night! She's nowhere to be found!\nEdgeworth:\nY-You mean she...!? She was with the victim!?\nBikini:\nIt's all the fault of my stupid, creaky old back!\nEdgeworth:\n(A little girl who was with the victim on the night of the murder... is gone!)\nGumshoe:\nAs they say... \"The plot thickens!\"Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagatama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nTh-That's...! That's one of the Fey clan's very own Magatamas! That's a priceless treasure you've got there!\nGumshoe:\nW...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me!\nBikini:\nYes... You don't look it, but now I can see you're a real fan of the occult!\nEdgeworth:\nExcuse me?\nBikini:\nOh, of course this piece couldn't possibly be real, but to have such a nice replica... Clearly, you are a big fan of the Kurain Tradition!\nGumshoe:\nW...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me!\nEdgeworth:\n(I should have known better than to show this thing around...)\n\n\n\n\nHanging Scroll\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nHuh... Ahh! Well, well, well... Look what you've found! That's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, Mystic Misty Fey!\nEdgeworth:\n\"Fey\"...\nBikini:\nIt's been nearly 20 years since Mystic Misty's disappearance. Apparently, she intended to pass on the Master title to her daughter.\nEdgeworth:\nWho is this daughter?\nBikini:\nWell, I myself am part of a branch family of the Fey clan. But even I am not privy to information concerning the main family...\n\n\n\n\nIris's Hood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nWell, well, well! That's a Demon-Warding Hood! Acolytes are highly susceptible to possession by evil spirits, you know. That's why we always wear these for protection.\nEdgeworth:\nOh, I see...\nBikini:\nWhat are you waiting for? You won't get any protection just by holding it, you know! Put it on already!\nEdgeworth:\nNo! I can't...! I was just...!\nBikini:\n... Ha ha ha ho ho ho!\nGumshoe:\nHo ho ho! It's like it was made just for you, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean by that, Detective!?\nBikini:\nIt looks absolutely marvelous! You've just got to keep it on for a while!\nEdgeworth:\n(Is this some sort of divine retribution...?)\n\n\n\n\n\"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAbout this picture...\nBikini:\nWell look at that! I look pretty s-to-the-exy, don't you think!?\nGumshoe:\nUm, ah... Y-Yeah. Absolutely.\nBikini:\nUp until recently, we've avoided exposure in such magazines. But this time we had our reasons...\nEdgeworth:\nIs that so? For exampl--?\nBikini:\nHa ha ha ha ha!!! Well, why deny the world the sight of such a lovely face!?\n\n\n\n\nPhoto of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\n...Ohhhh! H-How could such a... terrible thing have happened...? It's all... It's all... It's all my fault!\nGumshoe:\nWell come on, lady... I don't think you need to take all the blame yourself.\nBikini:\nQuiet! What do you know anyway!?\nGumshoe:\n...Ouch. You're scary!\nBikini:\nWith that stupid 5 o'clock shadow and that stupid old coat of yours... It's too bad that you weren't the one that disappeared!\nGumshoe:\n... ...Why does she have to take it all out on me?\nEdgeworth:\n(Her anger does seem a little... manufactured.)\n\n\n\n\nNote to Iris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nDo you know anything about this old, crumpled-up letter?\nBikini:\n... Is that addressed to Iris?\nGumshoe:\nYup, it clearly says \"To Iris\" on it.\nBikini:\nI can't believe it... That girl doesn't have any secrets from me...\nEdgeworth:\n(Ah... So Sister Bikini didn't know anything about it...)\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix Wright profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nThis man... His face betrays a life of suffering and great weariness of the world.\nEdgeworth:\n...Um, sure.\nBikini:\nBut even so... I can't believe this guy actually jumped into the river! Think of all the fun things he might have enjoyed if he had just lived... Relentless spiritual training alone is no way to lead a complete life, huh...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n(It sounds like she's got some major regrets she's dealing with... Hmm... Perhaps I should let Gumshoe explain Wright's situation to her for me...)\nGumshoe:\nH-Hey! Don't look at me like that! Do you own dirty work! ...Sir!\n\n\n\n\nLarry Butz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nThis is Mystic Elise's apprentice, is it not? I think he might have a bit of a crush on me... Sweet boy at any rate.\nGumshoe:\nHuh?\nBikini:\nOh, I don't blame him. Sister Bikini understands the temptations of young men.\nEdgeworth:\n...Sure.\nBikini:\nBut I'm afraid it wouldn't be proper to abuse my position. I am head nun, after all. But, in return, I did allow him to draw a portrait of me.\nEdgeworth:\n(I pray it was a pose that maintained your modesty. For everyone's sake...)\n\n\n\n\nIris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou said you went with Maya to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple last night. Did you happen to see Iris while you were there?\nBikini:\nOf course I saw her. I told her to meet us after ringing the 10:00 bell for lights out.\nGumshoe:\nSo you're saying Iris came to the Inner Temple then?\nBikini:\nOf course she did. Iris has always been a good, obedient girl. After that, I had Maya begin her training ceremony.\nEdgeworth:\n(But that doesn't fit with Iris's story at all... She said that she never went to the Inner Temple!)\nGumshoe:\nAs they say... \"The plot thickens!\"\n\n\n\n\nBikini profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nIt's all my fault... Me and my stupid back! Mystic Elise has been murdered, an important acolyte is trapped... ...and a little girl has been lost!\nGumshoe:\nYou know you really shouldn't be so negative. It creates bad karma...\nBikini:\n...Quite right. I need to do some more training myself, I think...\n\n\n\n\nMaya Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nShe's a very important visitor, you know! An honored acolyte!\nEdgeworth:\n\"Honored\"? How so?\nBikini:\nThe Fey name is synonymous with the Kurain Channeling Technique. Therefore, she must be a spirit medium of great power indeed.\nGumshoe:\nNow that you mention it, one year ago... ...there was a case that was about the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique!\nEdgeworth:\n...Detective. I detest talk of supernatural drivel. I suppose now you'll say she has midi-chlorians?\nGumshoe:\nHo ho ho. So it gives you the creeps, huh, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n(...That's got nothing to do with it.)\n\n\n\n\nPearl Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nOh, this poor girl... Where could she have gone...?\nGumshoe:\nWell, we checked out her home and she's not there.\nBikini:\nAnd she's nowhere in the vicinity of the temple either...\nEdgeworth:\n(Which means... ...there's only a few other possibilities as to where she could be.)\nGumshoe:\nAh! Do you think maybe she fell off the bridge and was carried downstream...!?\nEdgeworth:\n... Why do you have to be such a pessimist, Detective!?\nGumshoe:\nNngh... I was just trying to think like you, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\n(Ironic. I became a pessimist only after I had the pleasure of working with you!)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nUmm, about this here...\nBikini:\nHmm... Let me see... Well, as you may know... In order to see reality for what it truly is... ...we strive to break our attachments to much of the transient, material realm. I guess you could call me an \"immaterial girl\"!\nGumshoe:\nI guess she lives in an immaterial world, huh Mr. Edgeworth?Main Gate (before clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nI'm just no good with people like her. She reminds me too much of my mother.\nEdgeworth:\n... May I speak now?\nButz:\nHuh? Sure.\nEdgeworth:\nI don't care how you feel about her personally... ...just tell me what you know about her and how she's related to the case.\nButz:\n... Don't you think you're expecting a little too much of me? I'm just a 25 year old jobless bum trying to be an apprentice artist!

Are you really gonna defend that nun, Iris, at the trial tomorrow?Edgeworth:\nYes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitment. (Changed from [Yes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitments.] in the original release)Gumshoe:\nWell, in that case... I've gotta be careful... Gotta make sure I don't leak the prosecution's whole investigation...Edgeworth:\nDon't worry about it, Detective. Just keep your mouth closed and I think most of it will flow out on its own.Gumshoe:\n... You got it, sir! I'll make sure it flows out like water from a tap! (Changed from [Roger, sir! I know exactly what you're saying!] in the original release)Edgeworth:\nY-Yes, you do that, Detective. (Just how much has your runny spout leaked over the years?)

You're right! But I'm pretty sure the Main Hall didn't have a 2nd floor.\nEdgeworth:\nHazakura Temple was built on a steep part of the mountain. The front and back of the Main Hall are on different levels.\nGumshoe:\nOh... That makes sense... But wouldn't it be easier just to build the place slanted, sir?\nEdgeworth:\n(I fail to see how he can consider that to be an even remotely good idea.)\n\n\n\n\nSkis, ski poles, or sled\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nAh!

Let's see if we can summarize what we've learned so far.\nGumshoe:\nOK! Let's take a look at the map. ...According to the testimony of Sister Bikini, the head nun... ...right after they'd finished dinner, she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple. (Changed from [...she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple right after dinner was finished.] in the original release) At 10 PM, after ringing the bell for lights out, Iris went to the Inner Temple. When she got there, Bikini had her take over while she went back to Hazakura Temple. After taking a hot bath to soothe her back... ...Sister Bikini witnessed the murder in the courtyard! If you want more details, you should ask Bikini herself in the Main Hall.\nEdgeworth:\n(The Inner Temple, huh...? I'd like some more information about that place...)\n\n\n\n\nTomorrow's trial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe trial begins tomorrow, but who's the prosecutor?\nGumshoe:\nI'm pretty sure it's that Godot guy, but... ...nobody can get a hold of him, so they're looking for a replacement.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean...?\nGumshoe:\nIt's really weird. All of a sudden, no one can reach him! Hmm, I wonder if the rumors are true. Maybe since Mr. Wright caught a cold and won't be defending, he just lost interest.\nEdgeworth:\nI intend to appear in court in the role of defense lawyer. However... I would be quite unhappy if it came out that I'm actually a prosecutor.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, I can see why. But I'm not the one you have to worry about... I think the real problem is gonna be that judge...\nEdgeworth:\n...Yes, he certainly would remember my face, even after such a long absence. That's why I requested another judge preside over the case. We've only met each other once. There's a good chance he won't remember me at all.\nGumshoe:\nY-Yeah, but... what about the prosecutor? Everyone in the prosecutor's office must know you! Wouldn't it be a problem if someone there made a big stink, sir?\nEdgeworth:\nThere's no need to worry. I pulled a few strings and arranged for a prosecutor of my own choosing.\nGumshoe:\nWow, Mr. Edgeworth... I had no idea you had such a powerful string to pull!\n\n\n\n\nInner Temple (appears after \"What happened\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this Inner Temple that Maya was supposedly training at...?\nGumshoe:\nAccording to Bikini, it's an old building they use for training the acolytes. It's on the other side of Dusky Bridge.\nEdgeworth:\n(The bridge that burned down, huh...) Is there anything else on the other side of that bridge besides the Inner Temple?\nGumshoe:\nNope, not a thing.\nEdgeworth:\nNothing?\nGumshoe:\nThe other side is surrounded by cliffs on all sides... In a way, it's kinda like a little island out there.\nEdgeworth:\n(So the only thing there is the Inner Temple...)\nGumshoe:\nI hear it's not the kind of place a person could survive in.\nEdgeworth:\n(Please be alright, Maya...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictim's Staff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nOh, so I think I might have already told you about this, but... The truth is... When I was a little kid...\nEdgeworth:\nYou wanted to become a wizard, right?\nGumshoe:\nHey, that's amazing! How did you know that!? So? What do you think? I'd make a really great one, don't you think?\nEdgeworth:\nWe just had this conversation a little while ago, Detective!\n\n\n\n\nShichishito\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThis sword represents the multiple branches that life can take, all ending as one.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... I've never heard that one.\nGumshoe:\nYou know what I think about sometimes? What kind of life would I have had if I hadn't joined the Homicide Division.\nEdgeworth:\n...So you think about that kind of thing too, huh?\nGumshoe:\nOf course I do. I think about it a lot. Me as a traffic cop. Me as a detention officer. Me as the Blue Badger...\nEdgeworth:\n(...I guess he doesn't have any plans to leave the force.)\n\n\n\n\nBikini profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThis is the witness who saw the crime take place out there in the temple courtyard. I'm pretty sure it's gonna be her testimony that'll be key to this case, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nSo you mean she's going to be a witness in the trial tomorrow...?\nGumshoe:\nOf course! A nun is as trustworthy as you can get! We got this one in the bag! ... Oh. I-I mean, I've always been on your side, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! So yeah, this is a pretty tight spot we've gotten ourselves into, huh!?\nEdgeworth:\n(Now I understand why Wright is always breaking into a cold sweat...)\n\n\n\n\nMaya Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI wonder if Maya is alright? I could never show my face to Wright again if something were to happen to her.\nGumshoe:\nAww, it'll be OK. If that ever happens, you can just show him my face. How's that...?\nEdgeworth:\n...\nGumshoe:\nAck! Um, I didn't mean it like that, sir! It was just a silly little joke!\nEdgeworth:\nI wonder if there is another way to get across to the other side? The support wires for the bridge are still intact, correct?\nGumshoe:\nThat bridge is almost 20 yards long... I know I may look like it, Mr. Edgeworth, but I'm no super hero.\nEdgeworth:\n(In any case, I just hope Maya is alright...)\n\n\n\n\nPearl Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat about Pearl...? Has no one seen her at all since last night?\nGumshoe:\nSeems that way... Apparently, she hasn't gone back to Kurain Village either, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nBut it's true that she was with Elise Deauxnim at some point last night?\nGumshoe:\nNo doubt about it. Ah...! Y-You mean that maybe whoever killed Ms. Deauxnim also...!?\nEdgeworth:\nD-Don't jump to any crazy conclusions!\nGumshoe:\nOooooouuuch! ...You sure have one mean punch, Mr. Edgeworth!

As I said, I was frightened by it...\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this \"Heavenly Hall\" the letter mentions?\nIris:\nIt's a small mountain shack at the base of Dusky Bridge.\nEdgeworth:\nA small shack, huh...?\nIris:\nIt's more like a broken-down shack that no one would ever want to go near.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... Where is it on this map...?\nIris:\n...It's around here. To get there, you must follow a small path down from Dusky Bridge... The reality is, to get to the Inner Temple, I had no choice but to cross that bridge. But the thought that such a terrible criminal could be lurking at Heavenly Hall... I... I was so scared by the whole affair that I didn't even want to think about it. (Changed from [I... I was so scared by the whole affair that I didn't want to think about it at all.] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\nSo this is the secret that you locked away in your heart... (Changed from [So is this the secret that you locked away in your heart?] in the original release)\nIris:\n...Yes.\nEdgeworth:\n(It looks as though I may have to visit this \"Heavenly Hall\" now. Maybe I'll find some sign of our mystery blackmailer.) In any case, you still claim to have never left your room last night?\nIris:\nYes. That's exactly right.\nIris's Testimony added to the Court Record.\nEdgeworth:\nThe trial starts tomorrow... I promise you, I will win. I'm going to win so that you and Phoenix Wright can see each other again.\nIris:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nBut when I do... ...you must promise me that you will tell him your secret.\nIris:\n... But it's pointless...\nEdgeworth:\nWhy would you say that?\nIris:\nBecause I may know who Phoenix Wright is... But... He has no idea who I am.\n\n\n\n\nFrightened?

Maybe I'll find some sign of our mystery blackmailer.)\n\n\n\n\nInner Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI just finished speaking with the head nun of Hazakura Temple. She testified very clearly as to what happened. She said she saw you stab Ms. Elise Deauxnim with a sword.\nIris:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nAnd one other thing. She said that when Maya Fey began her training at the Inner Temple... ...you were there as well.\nIris:\nWhat...!?\nEdgeworth:\nWhen I spoke with you last, you claimed that you never went to the Inner Temple. And yet, Sister Bikini says she met with you at the Inner Temple that very night.\nIris:\nB-But I... I didn't go there! I didn't go to the Inner Temple last night.\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm... It looks like she's unwilling to tell me the whole truth. I wonder if I'll find the answers I'm looking for if I break those Psycholocks?)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagatama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\n\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n-- I Was Frightened --\nEdgeworth:\nSince I have been handed this case, it is my duty to dig up all the answers. Understand?\nIris:\nY-Yes, sir...\nEdgeworth:\nThe smallest flame can sometimes bathe a case in a whole new light... In my years in court, I've seen it happen over and over again. That's why I'm committed to searching until I have those answers. Now then, is it really true that you didn't go to the Inner Temple last night...?\nIris:\nY-Yes, I swear... I already told you that.\nEdgeworth:\n...Yes. You said you didn't go because you were frightened.\nIris:\n...Th-That's right.\nEdgeworth:\nIf that's the case... ...then the obvious question is, \"What were you so afraid of?\"\nIris:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nIris... I wonder. Is this what frightened you so much that you couldn't even leave your own room!?\n\n\n\nPresent Note to Iris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I found this in the Main Hall. It is addressed to you.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nPerhaps THIS is what you were afraid of! ...Well!?\nIris:\nI-I'm sorry, but... you're wrong...\nEdgeworth:\nHuh...? Why is your voice trembling like that?\nIris:\nIt's just that... Your eyes... Your eyes are scaring me...\nEdgeworth:\nUrk! (Blast! I must be trying too hard to bluff.) ...Please excuse me. I'm still not used to this role I've been assigned.\nIris:\nN-No, I should apologize... I'm sorry for being such a scaredy-cat.\nEdgeworth:\nAnyway... I'm still determined to find the answers to this mystery.\nIris:\nBut I'm telling you, I really was in my room all last night.\nLeads back to:\n\"If that's the case...\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI found this in the Main Hall. It is addressed to you.\nIris:\nAh... Th-That's...!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, Iris...?\nIris:\nWhy... Why are you glaring at me like that?\nEdgeworth:\nYou were scared of the blackmailer who wrote this to you, isn't that correct!?\nIris:\nAaaaah!\n\n1 LOCK BROKEN\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Was it the evidence or the power of my glare that broke that lock...? Oh well, I don't suppose it matters either way.)\nIris:\nB-But, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\n...Yes?\nIris:\nI thought that letter was just someone playing a prank on me...\nEdgeworth:\nA \"prank\"?\nIris:\nWell, yes... After all, even if I did have a \"secret\"... ...there's no one to tell it to that would cause me any grief.\nEdgeworth:\n... Hmm... I wonder about that.\nIris:\nSister Bikini is like a mother to me. I would never hide anything from her!\nEdgeworth:\nNo, you may not have anything to hide under normal circumstances. However! Last night was different.\nIris:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nUnfortunately, I don't know the exact nature of your secret yet. However...! Whatever it is... ...there is one person you didn't want your secret told to!\n\n\n\nPresent Phoenix Wright profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Phoenix Wright...\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWell, Iris?\nIris:\n...Mr. Edgeworth. Is it just possible that maybe... ...you yourself have a deep, dark secret in your heart?\nEdgeworth:\n...! Why do you say that...!?\nIris:\nAs they say, it takes one to know one.\nEdgeworth:\n(How could she have known about that...? Is she peering into my soul!?) ...It's true that there is a deep-seated darkness in my heart. However, the only way I can get rid of it is to fully uncover the truth!\nIris:\nYou mean... the truth behind my secret?\nLeads back to:\n\"Unfortunately, I don't know the exact nature of your secret yet.\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nPhoenix Wright...\nIris:\nAh...!\nEdgeworth:\nYou mean something to Wright, it seems... And I can tell he holds a special place in your heart as well. That's why you didn't want him, of all people, to know your deep, dark secret. Well? What do you have to say?\nIris:\n... I should've expected as much... Especially from a friend of his...\n\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nUnlock Successful\n\n\n\nNote to Iris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis letter... It appears to be addressed to you.\nIris:\n... I think it's someone's idea of a joke, Mr. Edgeworth. That's why I threw it away.\nEdgeworth:\n(She's not giving me a straight answer for some reason. I'm going to have to find someone else who can give me more information about this.)\n\n\n\n\nShichishito\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nI-Is that the murder weapon?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, it is. Have you ever seen it before?\nIris:\nY-Yes. Mystic Ami was holding it... in the courtyard...\nEdgeworth:\n(And apparently, the head nun witnessed the whole sad affair... She saw you stabbing Ms. Elise Deauxnim with this very sword last night...)\nIris:\n...?\n\n\n\n\nLarry Butz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nOh... That's Mr. Laurice. He's a very sincere, hard-working person. He was even kind enough to draw a portrait of me.\nEdgeworth:\n(Knowing Larry... ...this woman is exactly the type that he would fall in love with at first sight.)\n\n\n\n\nBikini profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...I'd like to ask you about Sister Bikini, the head of Hazakura Temple.\nIris:\nShe raised me as if she were my real mother.\nEdgeworth:\n\"As if she were your real mother\"...?\nIris:\nI was left at Hazakura Temple when I was just a small child. And she's taken care of me ever since.\nEdgeworth:\nForgive me for sounding rude, but what about your family?\nIris:\n... I'm sorry, but I'd rather not talk about this.\n\n\n\n\nMaya Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nOh... This is the woman who was to undergo training last night. She seems like a very strong, reliable woman.\nEdgeworth:\n... (Whatever else anyone has to say about this Iris woman... ...I can't exactly say she's the best judge of character.)\n\n\n\n\nPearl Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nThis is the trainee's younger sister, correct? She's cute as a button! And she seems to really love mashed potatoes and gravy!\nEdgeworth:\n...Oh?\nIris:\nShe even said she was going to have the leftovers for dinner the next night... And then she took the leftover potatoes and the whole pot of gravy with her to her room.\nEdgeworth:\n(That's quite an appetite for such a little girl...)February 8Heavenly HallGumshoe:\nWhoa! Not much of a view down here, huh? It's still better than the view from my apartment, though.Edgeworth:\nTsk! Someone's here! Hide yourself, Detective!???:\nOh! Why why why!? Why does this always happen!?Butz:\nWhenever I find a girl I like, they always run away! I even chased one of them to Japan... Next it's going to be prison, I guess. (Changed from [I even chased one of them to Tibet... Next it's going to be prison, I guess.] in the original release) ...I'll steal that detective's wallet. That'll get me locked up for sure. ...Nah. I can't do that to someone who looks like he's down on his luck.Gumshoe:\n...He's just talking to himself.Edgeworth:\nShh! Be quiet and listen!Butz:\nI knew it... I shouldn't have done that! I blew it again...Edgeworth:\n(\"Done that\"? What did he do, I wonder...)Gumshoe:\nHey! You! About what you just said... I got an objection!Butz:\nWh-Wh-Wh-What the...!? Ed-Edgey! You dirty rat!Edgeworth:\n*glare* (Gumshoe... You oaf...!)Gumshoe:\nI-I'm sorry, sir! Before I knew it, I was shouting out, \"Objection!\". And in a loud, commanding voice, too! I even pointed with my pointer finger!Edgeworth:\n...You've watched too many trials.Gumshoe:\nI'm sorry!Edgeworth:\nOK, Larry, the jig is up. What have you got to say for yourself?Butz:\nUngh...Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEagle River\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThis is the Eagle River, sir. It runs pretty fast, so it doesn't ice over, even in the winter.\nEdgeworth:\nIf it had iced over, Wright would have been in some serious trouble.\nGumshoe:\nYou're right about that! He would've landed on the ice, and slid downstream to who knows where.\nEdgeworth:\n(...Not exactly what I meant, but alright...)\n\n\n\n\nDusky Bridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt's a little far, but I have a pretty clear view of Dusky Bridge from here.\nButz:\nAhh. I still can't believe it! ...Really.\nEdgeworth:\n...? What is it, Larry?\nButz:\nHuh! Err, uhh, nothing. It's nothing!\nGumshoe:\nSounds pretty suspicious to me!\nEdgeworth:\n(Something about that statement smells... And you know what they say...)\n\n\n\n\nStairway\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThese go all the way to Dusky Bridge. It's a pretty long, but easy, walk.\nGumshoe:\nI fell down 4 times on my way down here, sir!\nButz:\nOh, sorry about that, Detective. I ate four bananas and tossed their peels on the stairs on my way down here...\nGumshoe:\n... What!? So that's what I was slipping on!\nButz:\nBe careful on the way back. Those deadly banana peels are still out there.\nGumshoe:\nHmm... That's a real important piece of information right there, Mr. Edgeworth!\n\n\n\n\nString of flags\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this festive-looking ornament?\nButz:\nIt reminds me of art class in grade school. We used to have a lot of fun decorating the classroom with origami. Remember?\nEdgeworth:\nW-Well, I...\nButz:\nOh, yeah... You were never any good at it.\nGumshoe:\nReally?\nButz:\nYeah, this guy was so bad, he couldn't even fold a dollar, let alone a crane. Everyone tried to comfort him, but he would just sit there sobbing.\nGumshoe:\nReally? I never would have expected that.\nEdgeworth:\nBe quiet already! I'll never forget the shame of that day! You want a crane! I can now make a perfect quarter-inch crane without a single flaw!\nButz:\n... You know, Edgey... Nothing for nothing, but a quarter-inch crane without a single flaw is not easy.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's quite a feat, Prosecutor Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\n(Grr... This is exactly why I hate childhood friends...)\n\n\n\n\nShack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThat's a horrible graffiti problem you've got there, pal.\nButz:\nYou don't know anything, Detective. This is art! It's an expression of my bittersweet love for Iris.\nEdgeworth:\nLarry. Do you know what the difference between graffiti and true art is?\nButz:\n... It's how the artist himself defines it, right?\nEdgeworth:\n... (I should've seen that one coming.)\nGumshoe:\nWell, if that's the case, then all of my lunchboxes are masterpieces too, pal!\n\n\n\n\nRoof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe straw roof is totally covered with freshly fallen powdery snow.\nGumshoe:\nWow, makes a nice image, doesn't it? I always did like the rustic look.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Heavenly Hall\"... I suppose it's an appropriate name in some sense.\nButz:\nYou got that right. Look at that bridge up there. This place has to be heaven, because that thing is hell.\nEdgeworth:\n... You would do well to remember, Larry... ...that this is a sacred place to some people.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeavenly Hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this little shack anyway?\nButz:\nWell, I just discovered it myself yesterday.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd why were you down here in the first place?\nButz:\nErr, come on... I'm an artist... I was looking for a good place to sketch. This is a great little place! It's err... artistic. It's quiet, it's cold, it's got no power, and it looks like it's about to collapse.\nGumshoe:\n...Sounds a lot like my apartment there, pal.\nEdgeworth:\n(One thing's for sure... No one is likely to show up and disturb you here...)\nButz:\nSo can I get you something to drink? Some hot water, maybe?\nGumshoe:\n...He's getting all buddy-buddy on us, sir.\n\n\n\n\nIris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\n...Listen to me, Edgey. You've gotta do this... You've gotta save Iris!\nEdgeworth:\nWhy are you so sure she's innocent? Because she's cute?\nButz:\nWatch your mouth! Anyway, I've made up my mind about it! I'm going to marry that girl!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nGumshoe:\nUmm... Mr. Edgeworth is pretending he didn't hear you, so I'm gonna ask for him. Have you already asked this girl to marry you?\nButz:\nNo, no. Not yet. But I can tell how she feels by the look in her eyes! She's got this \"I really want this man to carry me over the threshold\" look! I'm sure Nick would be surprised! He'd never imagine that I could marry such a beautiful girl like that!\nEdgeworth:\nSomething tells me he would be shocked, indeed.\nButz:\nThat's why I didn't want her to do anything dangerous. I mean, what am I gonna do if she gets hurt?\nGumshoe:\n... What is this guy trying to say? He lost me about a mile back...\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... If we really want to know the answer to that... (...we're going to have to drag him onto the witness stand.)\n\n\n\n\nThe night of the crime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nCome to think of it, you still haven't answered my question. Where were you and what were you doing last night?\nButz:\nAww, man... Don't you have anything else to talk about? With that kind of attitude, you'll never be a ladies' man like me...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nButz:\nO-OK, OK! Chill out with those scary eyes! I got it! If you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Something incredible\"?\n\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n\nButz:\n...Yeah, yeah. But let's not talk about that now. Let's talk about the good old days. What do you say? Come on, I'll pour you a nice cup of hot water.\nEdgeworth:\n(Why hasn't he realized... ...that I absolutely despise talking about the \"good old days\", especially with him?)\n\n\n\n\nThe night of the crime (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat exactly did you see last night?\nButz:\nWell... It's kinda hard to say...\n\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n\nButz:\nIt's one of those things... Ya know what I mean...? It's like... It's not so much \"what\" I saw, as it's the situation in general... You see what I'm getting at? Whew, that's a relief. Thanks, buddy. Ha ha ha ha ha.\nEdgeworth:\n(I have the strangest urge to smash this guy against those big, nasty locks...)\n\n\n\n\nThe night of the crime (after breaking Psyche-Locks)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo you were here in Heavenly Hall last night, were you not, Larry? And you saw the lightning hit Dusky Bridge, didn't you?\nButz:\nS-Sorry, Edgey...\nGumshoe:\nSorry doesn't cut it, you scumbag! Threatening a young lady like that...\nButz:\n*gulp*... ... Wait, hold up.\nGumshoe:\n...What now, pal?\nButz:\nWhat are you talking about!? What \"threatening\" stuff!?\nGumshoe:\nI'll tell you what! You tried to scare Iris by threatening to expose her secret, pal!\nButz:\nWhat do you mean threaten!? When did I threaten her!?\nGumshoe:\n\"...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed...\" That sure sounds like a threat to me, pal! Blackmail, in fact!\nButz:\nGimme a break! It's a love letter! Haven't you ever been in love!?\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What did you just say!?\nButz:\nMy love for her burns so hotly, it could melt all the snow on this mountain!\nEdgeworth:\nO-Oh? Then what is this secret you mention!?\nButz:\nCome on, Edgey... Don't you get it? I'm talking about the secret love between her and me! Obviously she wouldn't want old lady Bikini to know about it, right...? About our... hot and sour... bittersweet love affair!\nEdgeworth:\n... Alright, then why did you send a love letter in a business-like manila envelope!?\nButz:\nGive me a break! It's not my fault I didn't have any other envelopes! Yeesh!\nGumshoe:\nThen why were you so quick to apologize, pal!?\nButz:\nIt's cuz Edgey gave me that scary look of his!\nEdgeworth:\n... ...\nButz:\nWhat's wrong, Edgey? Why are you so quiet all of a sudden?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's it? THAT'S what all those huge locks were about? (Changed from [That's it? That's all [sic] those huge locks were about?] in the original release) I-I don't understand why you were so defensive...\nButz:\nWell, I dunno either... I guess the thing is... ...you shouldn't expect too much from a guy like me. ...Hey, come on. Don't let it get you down!\nGumshoe:\n... B-But Mr. Edgeworth! This guy is still hiding something! I know it!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nDon't forget what this guy said just a minute ago!\n\n\nButz:\nIf you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible.\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm... He's right!) Larry!\nButz:\nWh-What!? Y-You're looking at me like a hungry dog that just found a bone!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat was this \"something incredible\" you saw last night...? ...You're going to tell me, Larry! One way or another!\n\n\n\n\nSomething incredible (appears after \"The night of the crime\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"I... I already told you, didn't I?\"Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagatama (after clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\n\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n-- The Night of the Crime --\nEdgeworth:\nAlright, now you're going to tell me what you really saw last night...\nButz:\nWhoa. You're really upset, aren't you, Edgey? OK, I'll talk!\nEdgeworth:\n...Huh? (That was a bit too easy...)\nButz:\nYeah, anyway! It was awesome! Never seen anything like it! At around 10 o'clock last night, it started thundering. I'd been sleeping... I'm not sure for how long. Suddenly... ZING! The world in front of me went white! Like I'd just been slapped in the face by my old girlfriend, Naomi!\nEdgeworth:\n...And then?\nButz:\nAnd then... It was on fire! The bridge was on fire!\nEdgeworth:\nDusky Bridge caught on fire!? Are you saying you saw it with your own eyes?\nButz:\nHey! Why are you giving me the evil eye!? I'm telling the truth!\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm... There are still three Psycholocks remaining... (Changed from [Hmm... There are still 3 Psycholocks remaining...] in the original release) That means he's still trying to hide something...) By the way, Larry... Where were you when you saw that happen?\nButz:\nWh-Wh-Wh-Where you say? Wh-Wh-What do you mean!?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean, \"What do I mean\"!? ...Just answer the question!\nButz:\nI-I was in my own room... by the Main Hall! Where else would I be!?\nEdgeworth:\nAs usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar. The problem, I suspect, lies there...\nButz:\nTh-Th-Th-Th-There? Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Whaddya mean th-th-there?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's impossible for you to have seen lightning strike Dusky Bridge from your room!\n\n\n\nPresent Hazakura Temple Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This is a map of the area.

Try drinking your hot water. If you don't drink it fast it's going to get cold.\nEdgeworth:\nOh, sorry... (It's cold alright... The water... And my evidence.)\nButz:\nWell? Have you calmed down yet?\nEdgeworth:\nUm, yes... I'm going to think it over again.\nButz:\nH-Hey, I'm telling you... there's nothing to think over! I was in my room doing \"she loves me, she loves me not\" with a bunch of flowers.\nLeads back to:\n\"As usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar.\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis is a map of the area. Take a look around the vicinity of Hazakura Temple.\nButz:\nWh-What am I looking for?\nEdgeworth:\nI think that should be fairly obvious. The Main Hall is surrounded by trees and it's impossible to see the bridge from here.\nButz:\nWhat...!? Why didn't you tell me that before!?\n\n1 LOCK BROKEN\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Well? How about it?\nButz:\nHow about what?\nEdgeworth:\nDo you feel like talking now?\nButz:\nAbout what?\nEdgeworth:\n... (It looks like it won't be that easy after all...) ...You leave me no choice. I'll have to move on to the next step. You weren't in your room at the temple. So then... Where were you?\nButz:\nY-Y-You don't know that I wasn't in my room!\nEdgeworth:\n(So where was Larry, and why was he there...? If I've read the situation up to this point correctly, the answer is fairly obvious.) ...Very well then. Let's test my theory. The place you witnessed lightning striking Dusky Bridge from was... here!\n\n\n\nPresent Heavenly Hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall!\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis is where you were! Well, what do you think, Larry!?\nButz:\nOh... Not much I guess.\nEdgeworth:\n... I'm sorry, but what kind of answer is that?\nButz:\nWell, you were just making small talk, right? Like \"How are you doing?\" or something.\nEdgeworth:\n...Larry. Look at the expression on my face. Do I look like I was just making small talk?\nButz:\nTo be honest? No... I guess not. Ha ha ha ha ha...\nEdgeworth:\n(It appears I didn't think it through carefully enough.)\nLeads back to:\n\"So where was Larry, and why was he there...?\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall!\nButz:\n...Wh-Why would I be hanging out in this old shack? It's freezing cold, there's no electricity, and it could fall apart at any minute...\nEdgeworth:\nLarry... How do you know that anyway? How do you know there's no electricity? After all, it's not that dark yet.\nButz:\nAh... Uh-oh!\nEdgeworth:\nIn other words, you have just provided evidence to prove my theory... My theory that you've at least once in your life visited Heavenly Hall after sunset!\n\n1 LOCK BROKEN\n\nButz:\nI have to admit I'm impressed, Edgey! You're in a totally different league from Nick.\nEdgeworth:\n...That's nice. Now tell me. What were you doing at this cold little shack last night?\nButz:\nThat's what you might call... A \"Fair de Core\".\nEdgeworth:\nI think you mean \"affaire de coeur\". Could it be you were... waiting for someone?\nButz:\nOoooh nooo! Y-You really are one scary guy, you know...\nEdgeworth:\nI believe that last night, you were waiting for this person to come meet you!\n\n\n\nPresent Iris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n \nEdgeworth:\n...Well, Larry!? Was it THIS person...?\nButz:\n...You know what? You should save your finger pointing for the courtroom.\nEdgeworth:\nTsk...!\nButz:\nIt's no wonder people call you a workaholic. You work too hard! You should be like me!\nEdgeworth:\n(Well, I'd rather \"work too hard\" than \"hardly work\" like a loafaholic like you...) In any case... I know you were waiting for someone!\nButz:\nYeah, but... It's like I said. It's an \"affaire de guerre\".\nEdgeworth:\nNo, Larry. You mean \"affaire de coeur\". At least I think you do.\nLeads back to:\n\"Could it be you were... waiting for someone?\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry.\nButz:\nI told you before... Don't call me \"Larry\"...\nEdgeworth:\nThe person you were waiting for was... Iris!\nButz:\nOhh... Suddenly I feel cold all over, Edgey.\nEdgeworth:\nNo doubt because of my chilly glare.\nButz:\nSo you think I got the hots for Sister Iris, huh...? D-Do you have some kind of evidence!? You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing?\nEdgeworth:\n(This is where I draw the line and end this ridiculous little game...) Here's the evidence that you were waiting for Iris...\n\n\n\nPresent Note to Iris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...Here's your evidence.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n... I-Is it just me?\nEdgeworth:\nNow, I'm the one that suddenly feels cold...\nButz:\nMaybe it's because of my cold laugh?\nEdgeworth:\n(Grr... I hate making such stupid mistakes...)\nButz:\nDo you really have the evidence you say you do, Edgey?\nLeads back to:\n\"You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing?\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Here's your evidence. You called her to this spot with a pathetic blackmail letter!\nButz:\nOh! H-Hey! G-G-Give that back! You're embarrassing me! What are you doing with that anyway!?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's not important! ...I misjudged you, Larry.\nButz:\nWhat do you mean...?\nEdgeworth:\nTaking advantage of a woman's frailty like that! You should be ashamed of yourself!\nButz:\nOhhh... OHHHH!\nEdgeworth:\nFirst of all, what's this at the top of the letter? It says, \"Salutation here\"!\nButz:\nW-Well that's what it said in that book, \"Letter Writing for Dummies\"!\nEdgeworth:\nYou're not supposed to actually write that! That's where you're supposed to write, \"Dear Iris,\"!\nButz:\nWAAAAAAAAH!!! I'M SO SOOORRY!\n\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nUnlock Successful\n\n\n\nVictim's Staff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nThat's the staff that Ms. Elise was always carrying... M-Ms. Elise... Whyyyy...? ...... ...Huh?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is it, Larry?\nButz:\nThere's something missing from this staff...\nEdgeworth:\n(There's something missing...?)\n\n\n\n\nMaya Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nOh, it's Maya. Nick was trying to go save her, you know. But instead, he wound up falling off the bridge. I'm not surprised though. Nick always gets himself into trouble.\nEdgeworth:\n(Well if that isn't the pot calling the kettle black...)\nButz:\nI just hope that Maya doesn't catch a cold, too...\nEdgeworth:\n...Or something worse.\n\n\n\n\nPearl Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nOh, hey! It's Pearl! But she's way cuter than this Pearl I used to go out with... Like, in a kid-cute way, yeah?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, well... Apparently she hasn't been seen the whole morning.\nButz:\nWh-What did you say!? Edgey! Why are you wasting your time with me then!? What's wrong with you!?\nEdgeworth:\nExcuse me?\nButz:\nIf anything happens to her, I'll never forgive you!\nEdgeworth:\n...!\nGumshoe:\n...Wow, I guess he's right for a change, sir.\nEdgeworth:\n(Now I feel like I'm the bad guy in all of this...)Butz:\nI... I already told you, didn't I? I saw lightning strike Dusky Bridge!Edgeworth:\nYes, and I believe it was the incredible sight you saw. But now that I think about it, something doesn't quite ring true.Butz:\nWh-What doesn't?Edgeworth:\nIf that's all there is to your story, your heart wouldn't have had all those locks! Therefore, Larry... (Changed from [Yes, Larry...] in the original release) I do believe you saw something last night. Something more incredible than lightning.

Mr. Laurice feels that way about... me...?Edgeworth:\nApparently... he isn't aware of your real secret at all.Iris:\n... ......Edgeworth:\nThis is no time to be embarrassed!Iris:\nI-I'm sorry! I'm just... hardly accustomed to that sort of thing.Edgeworth:\nWorry not... And in any case, whatever it was that he saw on the night of the incident... Mark my words, I will drag it out him!Iris:\nDoes that mean... Mr. Laurice is the witness today...?Edgeworth:\n...No. I believe that nun... will be the first to take the stand.Iris:\nSister Bikini...Edgeworth:\nShe claims to have seen the very instant in which you carried out the crime.Iris:\n...Edgeworth:\nI just want to ask you one last time. It really wasn't you who killed Ms. Elise Deauxnim, correct?Iris:\n... That is correct. It wasn't me.Edgeworth:\n...Very well, then.Iris:\nUm... Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\n...Yes?Iris:\nYou are a prosecutor... aren't you? Are you sure about this? If your true identity is revealed...Edgeworth:\nDon't worry. I've made the necessary arrangements. (Changed from [Don't worry. ...I've taken the necessary steps.] in the original release)Iris:\nI-I see... (Changed from [Y-You have...?] in the original release)Edgeworth:\n...Iris. It is a prosecutor's job to doubt people.Iris:\n...Edgeworth:\nBut right now... I am a defense attorney. A defense attorney's job is to believe in people, and to believe until the bitter end. That's what my friend told me once. (Changed from [That's what a friend of mine told me once.] in the original release)Iris:\nMr. Edgeworth...Edgeworth:\nI simply ask that you watch and decide for yourself... (Changed from [You may pass judgment on me from the defendant's chair. You are the one to decide...] in the original release) ...whether or not I am fit to do the task I have been entrusted. (Changed from [...whether or not I am able to do the task I have been entrusted.] in the original release)Iris:\n... ...Very well, sir. I leave my defense in your capable hands.February 9, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 7Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Sister Iris of Hazakura Temple.Edgeworth:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:\n...The defense does indeed appear to be ready... However, the same cannot be said for the prosecution in this case.Edgeworth:\n...Indeed.Judge:\nI'm not sure I like such blatant waste of this court's time. An empty prosecutor's chair can only mean... ...that the prosecutor has no confidence in their ability to prove their case. It would seem this case is already over before it had a chance to begin. I am ready to announce my verdict at this time. This court finds the defendant...???:???:\nThe prosecution... stands ready.Judge:\nA-And you are...?von Karma:\nFranziska von Karma... Prosecuting prodigy.Judge:\nV-Von Karma, you say...? Perchance, you wouldn't be of any relation to the legendary prosecutor Manfred von Karma?von Karma:\n... Legends are a thing of the past. I am a Von Karma. That is all. Upon a special request, I flew in today for the purposes of prosecuting this case.Judge:\nY-You did!? Then... you must be quite a big shot, eh! By the way, Mr. Edgeworth...Edgeworth:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nI'm almost certain that I've seen you somewhere before. Or am I just imagining things? You look very much like a prosecutor I met once...Edgeworth:\n...I believe you are imagining things, Your Honor.Judge:\nMs. von Karma? Do you have anything to say?von Karma:\n... There is no such weakling as this man among those of the Prosecutor's Office.Judge:\nThere... there isn't...? But I'm sure... once before, in this courtroom... Ack!von Karma:\n...I told you, there is no such weakling!Judge:\nWh-What is that!? A whip!? I'm not sure I care for such a thing in my courtroom! B-Bailiff! Remove that whip, at...Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\n...I have no objection to the whip.Judge:\nY-You don't...?Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution can wield a whip or drink seventeen cups of coffee... But there is still only one truth. That is what I stand here to prove today!von Karma:\nThis promises to be interesting... Miles Edgeworth. ...I had expected to face Phoenix Wright here today. But looking at you now... ...maybe this is what I have been waiting for all this time. Miles Edgeworth! I will not allow this chance to crush you slip through my fingers!Edgeworth:\n...I see you brought your flair for the histrionic.Judge:\nAllow me to add to the things I'm not sure about... People acting bizarrely in my court! Uwa-hah!von Karma:\n...The stage is set. Now continue with the proceedings, Your Honor.Judge:\nVery well. Ms. von Karma, please give an outline of this case. With as little whipping as possible!von Karma:\nThe murder victim is the famed picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Her body was found in the Hazakura Temple courtyard. She had been stabbed through the torso by a ceremonial sword from a golden statue.Judge:\nThe sword in this picture... is the weapon in question, correct...? ...Very well. The court accepts this photo of the crime scene.Crime Photo added to the Court Record.von Karma:\nThere is no mistake. This was the doing of Sister Iris. After all... there is a witness to her crime.Judge:\n...Very well. Please bring this witness to the stand!Edgeworth:\n(And so it begins... My first and my last trial... as a defense attorney!)von Karma:\n...Witness. State your name and occupation. Please.Judge:\nH-Hold on here! I'm not sure about being not sure if I care for this at all! Witness! Please stand up nice and straight!Edgeworth:\nIf I recall correctly... ...there are a few milk crates in the Defendant's Lobby for our back pain-plagued witness. (Changed from [...there are a few milk crates in the defendant's lobby for witnesses with bad backs.] in the original release)Judge:\nBailiff! Fetch a crate for this poor lady, please!von Karma:\n...Once again. Your name and occupation, please.Bikini:\nLittle old me? Well, I'm the head nun of Hazakura Temple on Eagle Mountain. My name is Bikini. You got it? Bikini. Nice to meet everyone.Judge:\n... But you don't appear to be wearing a bikini right now... Uwah!von Karma:\n...The courtroom is the garden of holy judgment. Those with lechery in their hearts should leave this sanctuary at once!Judge:\nY-You want me to leave!?Bikini:\nNo need to get your bikinis in a twist! Let me tell you, I'm a sight to behold in summer! Wha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha!Edgeworth:\nIn any case... Witness. I hear that you saw the crime take place on the night in question.Bikini:\nThat's right! I can still hardly believe it myself, to be honest. There's no way dear little Iris could do anything like that...Judge:\nLet us hear what you have to say then. First, tell us aboot your own movements that night, eh!Witness Testimony-- The Night of the Murder --Bikini:\nThat night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But...\nWell, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently.\nSo, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.\nThere's no bath at the Inner Temple, you see, and I needed a long, hot soak.\nIt was after I had finished, just as I was heading back... that's when I saw it!Judge:\nHmm... So it was simply coincidence that you found yourself returning to Hazakura Temple?Bikini:\n...Yes, you could say that. If my back hadn't been in so much pain, I would have stayed at the Inner Temple.Edgeworth:\n(That sounds like a pretty important statement she just made...)von Karma:\nThere is only one problem with this testimony that I can see... And you're not about to fall at the first hurdle, now are you, Miles Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth. ...Please begin your cross-examination.Cross Examination",

The treasured Kurain Village heirloom whose name means \"7 Branched Sword\". It is said that this sacred sword represents life itself. Though the branches may appear to be infinite, the choices limitless... ...like our destinies, the sword comes to but one end. One merciless point. And when the silver cord, the fragile thread that binds us to this world, is severed... ...the illusion is revealed and the implacability of fate is finally laid bare...February 6, 9:48 AMWright & Co. Law OfficesMaya:\nHey, Nick.Phoenix:\nYeah? What is it?Maya:\nYou know how I've got spiritual powers, unlike you?Phoenix:\nUm, sure... You are a spirit medium, after all.Maya:\nBut just like you, if I don't keep my powers sharp, they get dull, right?Phoenix:\nUm... I guess so, yeah.Maya:\nGlad you agree! OK, Pearly! You're up!Phoenix:\n(Pearls...?)Pearl:\nSo! That's why we need to go on a special \"Spiritual Hot Spot Tour\", Mr. Nick!Phoenix:\n...Huh? I'm lost. What's this magazine you're shoving in my face?Pearl:\nIt's the New Year's issue of \"Oh! Cult!\", Winter Spiritual Locations Special!Phoenix:\n...Oh. (Pearls looks so happy.)Maya:\n\"Maximize your spiritual powers with just one night of intensive training!\" ...Oh! It sounds too good to be true!Phoenix:\nI'll say. It sounds more like a scam to me.Maya:\nIt's at a spiritual retreat called \"Hazakura Temple\". It's way up in the mountains, and I bet it's nice and cold. ...Just perfect for training!Phoenix:\n(Now I definitely don't want to go...)Maya:\nYou know, I think I've heard of this temple before. It's a famous channeling dojo. It's hard for even real spirit mediums like us to make reservations up there!Phoenix:\nReservations...? For a temple? Are you serious?Pearl:\nDon't worry! I've already made special reservations, just for us!Maya:\nYeah! And I signed up for the \"Special Course\"!Phoenix:\nTh-That's nice. And the timing couldn't be better. ...Since we don't have a case right now anyway.Maya:\nAlrighty then! It's settled! Well, come on! Don't just stand there! Start packing your stuff!Pearl:\nYes, Mr. Nick! You'd better start packing your stuff!Phoenix:\nHuh...? M-ME!? Why do I have to go!?Maya:\nWell, we have to be accompanied by someone over 20 years old.Phoenix:\nHey! I don't have anything to do with spirit power. The only thing I can channel is a TV. ... So, um, is there a heated pool at this \"Hazakura Temple\"?Pearl:\nNo, but you can stand under a freezing waterfall!Phoenix:\n... Sorry, but I think I'll pass. I hate cold places.Maya:\nWhaaat!? No way! How can you be so selfish!?Pearl:\nCome on, Mr. Nick! Look at this place! Doesn't it look beautiful!?Phoenix:\nNope. Not going. I'm gonna be nice and toasty at home....... .................What the...!?Pearl:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Nick?Phoenix:\nLet me see that magazine! Th-This nun...Maya:\nIs she a friend of yours or something, Nick?Phoenix:\n(Th-This girl... I-It's...!)Dahlia:\nMy name is Dahlia Hawthorne. I just want to say... It's an honor for me to be here in your noble presence.Dahlia:\nHonestly, how can any woman ever count on you for anything? ...You disgust me!Phoenix:\nBut... It can't be! (She was found guilty and should still be in prison...)Pearl:\n...Mr. Nick?Phoenix:\n... I'll go.Maya:\nHuh...?Phoenix:\nHazakura Temple... I said I'll go.Maya:\nYay! Isn't that great, Pearly!?Pearl:\nYes! Oh, thank you! Thank you, Mr. Nick! You'd do anything for Mystic Maya, right? Even walk over burning coals, right!?\"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue received from Pearls.Phoenix:\n(Dahlia Hawthorne... I knew there was no way she could possibly be at that temple... But, I just had to be see for myself... ...who this \"nun\" really was.)February 7, 3:24 PMHazakura TempleMain GateMaya:\nBrrrrr... It-It-It's so c-c-cold here, Nick!Phoenix:\nMaybe you should put on something warmer for a change!Maya:\nW-W-Well, it's supposed to be c-c-cold... It's t-t-training. ...Ah-Achoo!Phoenix:\n(Her teeth are chattering so loudly, it's all I can do to make out what she's saying...)Pearl:\nWow, Mystic Maya! So this is the famous Hazakura Temple!Maya:\nP-P-P-Pearly... I-I-I-I... Ah-Achoo!???:\nWell, well, well... How nice to see you here. Welcome to our temple!Maya:\nOh...! Th-Th-Thank you... Ah-Achoo!???:\nOh my, my, my... Thank you for coming all this way. Come now, come now. You must have been cold.Phoenix:\nWhat's with the past tense...? We're freezing into human popsicles as we spea--!???:\nHo ho ho. Well, we are high up in the mountains after all. In any case, we shouldn't speak here. ...Please follow me inside.Maya:\nTh-Thank you. I was starting to think I would pass--???:\nOh! Yes, yes! I almost forgot to introduce myself.Bikini:\nI'm the head nun here at the temple. My name is Bikini.Maya:\nB-B-B-Bikini...!?Bikini:\nThat's riiight! Actually, that's my \"temple\" name. What do you think? It's a tradition to have one, and I wanted something that has a nice image to it. So I thought, \"Why not choose a bikini?\" Besides, it makes me seem younger. Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho!Maya:\nIt certainly does! Oh, I signed up for your \"Special Course\"!Bikini:\nWell, my, my, my. Quite brave of you considering how cold it is! Young people can be so reckless with their health! Don't blame me if you become one with those you channel. Wa ha ha! Ho ho ho!Pearl:\nR-Reckless...?Maya:\n\"Wa ha ha\"...?Pearl:\nMaybe you should take it easy tonight, Mystic Maya... We can come back another day.Maya:\nBut you went through all that trouble to get reservations for m--Bikini:\nYes, yes, yes, that's right! You've come all this way, so please, enjoy yourselves! There's still time before supper, so why don't you have a look around?Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nWhat do you think, Nick? Pretty awesome gate, huh?\nPhoenix:\nIt sure is... It looks pretty well maintained, too. This thing kinda puts your hometown to shame, Maya.\nMaya:\nYeah... Well, a lot of things have happened in Kurain Village. We used to be a lot richer, back when people hired us to perform channelings.\nPhoenix:\nOh, I see... But now the place looks a bit run down...\nMaya:\nHmm... I guess I was just born in the wrong time.\n\n\n\n\nMain Hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nThat looks like the Main Hall where we'll be staying tonight. From here, it looks like one of those ice hotels you always hear about!\nPhoenix:\n...They gotta have a heater or something in there, don't you think? I don't wanna die.\nMaya:\nI'm not worried, I brought my hot-water bottle.\nPhoenix:\nDid you bring one for me?\nMaya:\nWhat are you talking about, Nick? Who carries around 2 hot-water bottles?\nPhoenix:\n(Brr! If the cold doesn't kill me, the ice queen over here will finish the job...)\n\n\n\n\nBell tower\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nOh, look! It's a cute little bell tower! I absolutely love the sound of a giant bell!\nPhoenix:\nOh? So, which do you like better? That or the sound of money?\nMaya:\n...! ...... Sorry, but I'll take money for the win, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What are you apologizing for?\n\n\n\n\nSnowmobile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nOh look, it's one of those snow motorcycle things!\nPhoenix:\nMost people call that a \"snowmobile\", you know.\nMaya:\n\"Snow motorcycle things\", \"Snowblowmeal\". Same thing. Hmm... Too bad we didn't invite Desirée. I bet she could race like the wind on this \"Slowmobile\"! Or maybe she'd give me ride on this \"Blowsnowbile\".\nPhoenix:\nArgh! I told you, it's \"snowmobile\"!Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanneling dojo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUmm... So what's a \"channeling dojo\" anyway?\nBikini:\nOh my, my, my... You don't even know that?\nMaya:\nForgive him, Sister, for he knows not what he is saying.\nBikini:\nWell, well, well. Just call me Bikini and forget that \"Sister\" part. A channeling dojo is basically a spiritual power training ground. We have special holy items prepared here to help people boost their spiritual power.\nPhoenix:\nH-Holy items...?\nBikini:\nIf you train an entire evening surrounded by these items... Aaah. It's quite mysterious. The spiritual power of these items seems to envelop you. Wa ha ha ha.\nPhoenix:\n(Wow, she must have just gotten off the trolley from the land of make-believe...)\nMaya:\nUm, so what exactly is the \"Special Course\"...?\nBikini:\nYou must be incredibly devoted to be interested in that at such a young age! It's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant a spell... ...30,000 times! All while being showered in freezing cold spirit water.\nMaya:\nEh...?\nBikini:\nIt's February now, right? You have to be careful this time of the year... If you don't watch it, you'll catch pneumonia or maybe even die of hypothermia... So be careful, you hear? Wa ha ha. Ho ho ho. Ha!\nMaya:\nHow am I supposed to \"be careful\"...?\nPearl:\nOh no... I knew I shouldn't have signed Mystic Maya up for this...\n\n\n\n\nThe other nun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUmm, Sister... About this picture...\nBikini:\nWell, well. Look at that. I must say I look rather divine here, don't you think?\nPhoenix:\nOh, um, yeah. Unforgettable in every way.\nBikini:\nYou mean it? Oh, I knew it! Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho ho! The makeup was pretty tough, but Iris helped me out.\nMaya:\n\"Iris\"...?\nBikini:\nThe cute little girl in the photo. She looks just like me, doesn't she? We're just a small temple here, so she and I run the entire place.\nMaya:\nReally? That kinda sounds like fu--\nPhoenix:\nSorry to cut in, but...! This \"Iris\"... Where is she right now?\nBikini:\nOh! Just listen to you! You haven't come all the way up here just to find a girlfriend, have you?\nPearl:\n... *glare*\nPhoenix:\nNo, no, no! Th-That's not what I had in mind at all...\nBikini:\nAnyway, Iris is in the Inner Temple preparing for this evening.\nMaya:\nInner Temple...?\nBikini:\nYes, yes, that's right. Iris will be back this evening. Why don't you go have a look at the Main Hall for now? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha.\nPhoenix:\n(So she's in the Inner Temple, huh...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm, do you think you could take a look at this?\nBikini:\nI may not look like it, but I can tell you I'm very much in demand. And to be quite honest, I'm finding this a little difficult to say...\nPearl:\n...What IS she trying to say, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI think she's trying to say that she's busy.\nMaya:\nBut seriously Nick, what's the deal? Nothing has even happened yet and you're already shoving evidence into people's faces. You need to forget about work and relax a little.\nPearl:\nTry to have some fun, OK Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, you're right... (Sure. Pin the hypothermia on the lawyer is great fun!)February 7Hazakura TempleMain HallMaya:\nBrr... It's fr-freezing in here, too! Achoo!Pearl:\nHee hee. It reminds me of the Meditation Room in Fey Manor!Phoenix:\n...Pearls, you've been in an unusually good mood since we got here.Pearl:\nWell, kids are made of energy, you know!Phoenix:\nAs for you, Maya, you look like you're about to catch a bad cold.Maya:\nW-W-Well, I'm not exactly a little kid anymore, I guess. Ah-Achoo!Phoenix:\n(Nngh... Is she going to make it...?)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSliding doors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI bet the writing on these sliding doors are instructions for spirit channeling... Kinda like how we scribbled math formulas on the bathroom walls to remember them. Except we couldn't go to the bathroom during tests... And I can't read these walls.\n\n\n\n\nObjects on floor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere are straw zabuton cushions arranged around a hibachi brazier... I haven't seen a layout like this since I saw this really old Japanese movie on TV. ...If it wasn't for this hibachi, they'd probably freeze to death.\n\n\n\n\nAltar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's an altar. It looks a bit old, but someone does a good job taking care of it. Speaking of altars, I remember seeing one like this in Kurain Village last year. I guess they really do have something to do with spiritual power after all.\n\n\n\n\nMagatama on altar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere's a laughably large Magatama on the altar. If I can see Psyche-Locks with the tiny Magatama I've got... ...I can only imagine what kind of power this bad boy has under his hood!\n\n\n\n\nLeft corner near altar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's a stack of straw zabuton cushions. Maya told me this type of zabuton is called \"enza\"... I suppose if I'd never come here, I'd have missed out on all these new things.February 7Suspension BridgeMaya:\nWow! Look at this broken down old bridge, Nick!Phoenix:\nY-Yeah, and look at that big canyon below us.Maya:\nHey! There's a river down there! It looks like it's flowing real fast! ...What's wrong, Nick? You look like you've seen a ghost!Phoenix:\nI-I'm just not very good with heights...Maya:\nOh... Hey! I've got it! Maybe you should face your fear and try hurling yourself off the edge? You know! One... Two... Three... Jump! It might be just what you need to get over your fear of heights!Phoenix:\n...Yeah, death is a real good way to overcome phobias alright. Anyway, it sure looks like a rickety bridge.Maya:\nCan't argue there. That's probably why it's called, \"Dusty Bridge\".Phoenix:\nRead it again, Maya. It says, \"Dusky Bridge\".Maya:\nWell, it's practically the same thing.Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCliff on opposite side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like it's about 20 yards to that cliff over there.\nMaya:\nI guess that's where I'll be training tonight. Do you want to train with me, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nAnd do the Special Course? I think not.\nMaya:\nBut it'd be so great if you had spiritual powers, too! (Really? \"I see dead people\" sounds more like a cause for alarm to me...)\n\n\n\n\nWooden sign on left side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere's a narrow path going off in a different direction than that of the Main Hall.\nMaya:\nThe sign here is so old, the text seems to have vanished.\nPhoenix:\nThe path leads to a wooden staircase that goes down to the bottom of the canyon.\nMaya:\nOK, I'll write, \"wooden staircase\" on it then.\nPhoenix:\n...Do you really think that is necessary? You'd have to be blind not to see the stairs.\nMaya:\nWell, it can't hurt. Just pass me a pencil, OK?\nPhoenix:\nGraffiti is a crime, Maya.\n\n\n\n\nBridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! Why don't we hop across the bridge. It'll be fun!\nPhoenix:\nI'm not so sure... It looks like a bunny hopping across the bridge would destroy it.\nMaya:\nOK, Nick. Then let's try to find a cute little white bunny and test your theory.\nPhoenix:\n(That right there sums up the fundamental difference between sane and insane.)\n\n\n\n\nBoulder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSome letters are engraved into a roughly cut boulder.\nMaya:\n\"D-U-S-T-Y Bridge\", huh?\nPhoenix:\nIt says, \"Dusky\"! \"Dusky Bridge\"! OK?\nMaya:\nC'mon, Nick! Take a look at that bridge and tell me it's not supposed to be \"Dusty\"! This sign is obviously wrong, and I'm gonna fix it! Now give me a pencil, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nDo I look like a pencil holder to you?\n\n\n\n\nPublic phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nI can't believe there's a public phone here. Who would ever use it?\nPhoenix:\nThe people who live here, I guess. I doubt they have any real phones there.\nMaya:\nYeah, but it took like 20 minutes to walk here from the Main Hall! ... It would've been smarter of them to build the Main Hall here, don't you think?\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe you should work on channeling someone who makes logical sense, Maya.After clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate:February 7Hazakura TempleMain HallMaya:\nTh-Th-The Main Hall... I th-think it's even c-c-c-colder in here! Achoo!Pearl:\nAh! Mr. Nick! Do you smell that? It smells like meat and gravy!Maya:\nYeah, you're right! I guess it's pot roast for tonight! Yum!Phoenix:\n...Weird. I thought they would serve something a little more... well, traditional.Maya:\nWhat are you talking about, Nick!? You think monks and nuns just sit around eating rice gruel all the time!?Pearl:\nMystic Maya is right! Ooh! I hope there's mashed potatoes, too! I love mashed potatoes!???:\nHa ha ha... What a cute little acolyte! Greetings to all of you.Phoenix:\nOh... Um, hello. (Wow, this lady makes Maya look like a 6.8/10 on the weirdness scale.)Maya:\nYour outfit... Did you come here for the Special Course, too...????:\nHa, ha, ha... Unfortunately, no. Actually, I'm...Pearl:\nAaaaaaaaaah! Y-You're...! Y-You're...! You're Ms. Elise Deauxnim!Elise:\nYes, that's right... You know of me?Pearl:\nM-M-My name... My name is Pearl Fey! I-I'm your biggest fan!Maya:\nWho is she, Nick?Phoenix:\nHmm... I see it now... Zvarri! A fortune-teller...?Pearl:\nI-I've got all your books, Ms. Deauxnim!Elise:\nHa, ha, ha... What a sweet thing to say. And please, call me Elise.Phoenix:\nUm, \"books\"...?Pearl:\nMr. Nick, don't you know anything!? Don't you even know who this is?Phoenix:\nWell, um... ...An author, maybe?Elise:\nYes, and an illustrator. ...Of picture books.Maya:\nPicture books, huh? Oh, now I get it...Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElise Deauxnim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... I'm sorry I didn't know who you are. I don't get a lot of chances to really enjoy picture books.\nElise:\nIt's alright. I take no offense to that. My books are nothing but simple stories for children.\nPearl:\nAnd really beautiful pictures too, Ms. Elise! Your books always make me feel as if my heart has been purified.\nElise:\nHa ha ha... It makes me feel very happy to hear you say that.\nPhoenix:\n(I do have to admit... She certainly seems like a kind, sensitive lady.)\nPearl:\nMs. Elise won an award last year for her book, \"The Magic Bottle\"!\nElise:\nYes... A friend of mine secretly submitted a story I had written to a publisher. They liked it so much that they asked if it was alright to make it into a book.\nPhoenix:\nWow... It must have been a really great story.\nMaya:\n...Maybe I should try to write a children's book, too. If I do, you can secretly send it to a publisher for me, Nick.\nElise:\nRecently, I've accepted a sort of... apprentice you might say.\nPhoenix:\nAn apprentice?\nElise:\nHe calls himself Laurice... Laurice Deauxnim. I believe he's off doing some landscape sketches now... On Laurice's behalf as well, I'd like to thank you for your support.\nPearl:\nOf course, Ms. Elise! Anything for you!\nElise:\nHa ha ha...\n\n\n\n\nWhy come here?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPearl:\nUm... Why did you come to Hazakura Temple, Ms. Elise? Are you here... to do some spiritual training?\nElise:\nHa ha ha... No, that's not it. I'm actually here to gather materials for a new book I'm working on.\nPearl:\nWow! I-I can't wait to read it!\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls is completely taken with her...)\nElise:\nI wanted to do a book with a more Japanese feel to it this time.\nPhoenix:\n...So is that why you're dressed like you are?\nElise:\nThe children have a certain image of me in their minds. I don't want to disappoint them...\nPhoenix:\n(What can I say... She's really a sweet lady...)\nPearl:\nWow, Ms. Elise, you're dressed up like a mountain nun!\nElise:\nYes. The good people here were kind enough to let me borrow this... I'm wearing training clothes underneath my robe, as well.\nMaya:\n...I want a staff like that.\nElise:\nYou like the crystal sphere? It's real amethyst, you know.\nMaya:\nMaybe we'll find one like that up here on this mountain. Good luck, Nick! I know you'll find me one!Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMs. Deauxnim? What do you think about this?\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Do you think Ms. Elise is a suspect?\nPhoenix:\nHuh...?\nPearl:\nYou may be Mystic Maya's special someone, but I won't let you do this to Ms. Elise!\nPhoenix:\n(A suspect? Why would I suspect her of anything? It's not like anything's happened.)\nMaya:\nIsn't it cute, Nick? Pearly's getting all overprotective of her new friend.After clearing all Talk options:Elise:\nWell, you'll have to excuse me now... I have to go help with the dinner preparations.Pearl:\nWow! You mean you're cooking dinner tonight?Elise:\nThat's right. Would you like to help too, Pearl?Pearl:\nYes, yes! I want to help with whatever I can!Phoenix:\n(Pearls looks like she just won the lottery...)Maya:\nOh, I'll help too, then...Elise:\n...No, it's fine. Please don't worry about it. Feel free to relax and explore the area with your friend.Maya:\nHuh!? But...Elise:\n...Oh, yes! Please take this. I think it will be of help to you. It's a map of the area. We wouldn't want you to get lost now, would we?Phoenix:\n(The \"Inner Temple\"... There it is, on the other side of the bridge...) Well, if you insist, I guess we'll take this chance to go check out the other temple.Hazakura Temple Map added to the Court Record.Pearl:\nOK! I'll see you two later then! Remember! You're not allowed to fight!Maya:\nCome on, Nick! Let's go! At least we'll stay warm if we keep moving!February 7Hazakura TempleMain GateMaya:\nHuh? Where did Sister Bikini go?Phoenix:\nI guess she went to the Inner Temple... To go help that other nun out.Maya:\nOh, right... I think her name is... Iris?Phoenix:\nY-Yeah... That was it. (I want to find out who Iris really is, but I'm scared of what I'll find...)Maya:\n...?February 7Inner Temple GateMaya:\nWhoa, that bridge was shaking like jello in an earthquake.Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nAnd at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I bet. (Changed from [And at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I'd bet.] in the original release)Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nNot to mention the last part only had like one board left on it!Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nWhat's wrong with you? Your face is all green.Phoenix:\nC-Can you not pick on me for a second? I'm still trying to get over the shock that we made it safely across that death trap.Maya:\nYeah, I guess I'm a bit surprised, too... Yikes! That \"temple\" is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse at any time... (Changed from [Yikes! That 'temple' is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse anytime...] in the original release)Phoenix:\nI guess people don't use it too often. Is this really where you're going to train tonight?Maya:\nThat has to be it. It's kinda creepy around here... Like a ghost might jump out at you or something!Phoenix:\n(A spirit medium afraid of ghosts...? Isn't it ironic, don't you think?)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI don't care how much you pay me, I don't want to cross that bridge again.\nMaya:\nNo worries, Nick. No one is offering you any money.\nPhoenix:\nThat's because no reasonable person would call that pile of popsicle sticks a bridge! The latter half of it was nothing more than a few planks of wood and some string!\nMaya:\nHey, if we want to get back, we've got no choice but to cross it again, you know.\nPhoenix:\n... Maybe I'll just stay... I've always dreamed of living in a little shack in the woods.\nMaya:\n...Wow, you really are scared, aren't you?\n\n\n\n\nSuspension wire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nIt looks like this bridge is suspended by 4 of these wires.\nPhoenix:\n...They're reeeally thin. Shouldn't they be just a little thicker...?\nMaya:\nOh, stop it! You're such a worrywart, Nick! If the bridge were really going to collapse... ...I'm pretty sure the boards would break before these wires ever did!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nWhat's wrong? You're turning into an over-ripe avocado again.\n\n\n\n\nBuddha statues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nOh, wow! Look at these neat Buddha statues. Maybe I'll take one home with me.\nPhoenix:\nMaya!\nMaya:\nBut there are so many. They wouldn't notice if I took just one.\nPhoenix:\nAre you kidding? Of course they'll notice! What are you gonna do with one of those anyway?\nMaya:\nPut it in the office of course! We can trade that wooden statue in the office reception area for one of these!\nPhoenix:\n(You know, come to think of it, where did that wooden statue come from anyway...?)\n\n\n\n\nIncinerator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nHey! There's a giant robot buried in the snow!\nPhoenix:\n... Well, there's something buried in the snow, but... I think it's an incinerator.\nMaya:\nOh... Hee hee. But you've gotta admit it looks a lot like a robot.\nPhoenix:\nUm, sure... Anyway, I don't think it gets used much. It's looking pretty rusty.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Do you think this Giant Robo-cinerator can walk?\nPhoenix:\nI told you! It's not a robot! ...And it's not especially big either.\nMaya:\nBah, you have no imagination. I thought it'd be real neat if you had to beat it to advance.\nPhoenix:\n(A fight between a lawyer and an overgrown furnace? Who'd ever pay to see that!?)\n\n\n\n\nYellow gate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nHey! A half-opened gate! That's practically a welcome mat!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, except the sign on here says, \"No Entry\".\nMaya:\nUmm, Nick. Rules are made to be broken, you know.\nPhoenix:\n...You expect a lawyer to go along with that?\nMaya:\nOh, come on! You're such an old lady sometimes! Let's just go!\nPhoenix:\nDon't blame it on me when Sister Bikini puts a curse on you.\nMaya:\n... Now you've got me scared. Um, let's just forget about it, OK?\n\n\n\n\nWooden log on left\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nLooks like there's something written on it.\nPhoenix:\nI can't read it, but if I had to take a good guess, I'd say it says, \"Inner Temple\".\nMaya:\nWhat's the point of a sign if you can't read it? Must be tough for the mailman when he's delivering here.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess the sign is a good indication of how long this place has been here...)\n\n\n\n\nGate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nSo that's the Inner Temple up ahead, huh?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks kinda run-down.\nMaya:\nWell, it wouldn't be very temple-like if it was all bright and shiny.\nPhoenix:\nSo you're training here tonight, huh?\nMaya:\nYup! Then everyone'll see my spiritual powers!\n...Uuurrrgh...ggnngh...ggh...\nPhoenix:\nSounds like your stomach wants to show off its digestive powers instead...\nMaya:\nI wonder if that roast is ready yet?February 7Inner TempleTraining HallPhoenix:\nMan, look at this place... It's just a tiny, freezing-cold room. So this is where you'll both be training, huh...Maya:\nHuh? What do you mean, \"both\"? I'm the only one.Phoenix:\nReally? But I thought...Maya:\nPearly's just a little kid. She couldn't handle this kind of intense training.Phoenix:\n(So says the girl who I can barely hear over her teeth chattering...) (Changed from [So says the girl who I can barely hear over her bones chattering...] in the original release)Maya:\nAnyway... The real training room must be behind that door over there. Hmm... Yup, definitely getting the feeling it's back there. (Changed from [Yeah, I get the feeling it's back there, definitely.] in the original release)Phoenix:\n(Even I can sense that there's something supernatural about the cavern behind that door...) (Changed from [If only because the cavern behind that door is giving off a real supernatural feel...] in the original release)???:\nUm... Excuse me, but... Who are you...? ...Ah! ...Phoenix:\nY-You're...Maya:\nHi there! We're just looking around since we're going to be staying here tonight...???:\n...Maya:\n...? Is something wrong????:\nUh, er, no! It-It's nothing...Maya:\nI wonder why she spaced out like that. Don't you, Nick?Phoenix:\nUh... D-Did you say something, M-Maya?Maya:\n... Not you too, Nick...Iris:\nI... M-My name is Iris. I'm one of the nuns here at this temple.Maya:\nI'm Maya Fey. It's a pleasure to meet you!Iris:\nThe pleasure is mine... ... Oh, er, please excuse me! I have some... um, chores to attend to.Maya:\nShe sure is beautiful... and a bit spacey, I guess... I guess she's just not used to talking with urban sophisticates like us.Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nNick?Phoenix:\n(That girl... It-It can't be, but...)Maya:\n...?Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDresser drawers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nLook at this antique dresser. I wonder if there's anything valuable inside. Let's have a look... Hmph... Nothing! Just a bunch of clothes. Hey, Nick.\nPhoenix:\n... Huh! Oh, sorry. I was just... thinking.\nMaya:\nOh? About Iris, I bet! Looks like you've been bitten by the love bug, Nick!\n\n\n\n\nMattresses\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere are a bunch of musty looking blankets and bedding sets piled up here. I wonder why they're even here in the first place? \nMaya:\nIt's because all spiritual training is done under the supervision of a nun. I wonder if Sister Bikini is planning to sleep in here while I train? \nPhoenix:\n(But if they sleep, what's the point of having them here in the first place...?)\n\n\n\n\nSacred cavern entrance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nThe actual training area must be on the other side of this door. I wonder what it's like. Phooey... It's locked. Come on, Nick! You know you want to open it for me!\nPhoenix:\n...I can't.\nMaya:\n... You've been in kind of a bad mood lately, haven't you, Nick? ...Zvarri! I know what it is! I-R-I-S.\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nHa ha ha ha ha! ♪Iris and Nick, sitting in a tree! K-I-S-S-I-N-G!♪\n\n\n\n\nHanging scroll\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(A hanging scroll... It doesn't look that old either...)\nMaya:\nAAAAAAH!\nPhoenix:\nAAAAAAAAACK! Wh-What is it!? Why did you scream like that!?\nMaya:\nTh-This scroll...! It-It's my mother...\nPhoenix:\nWh... Whaaaaaaaat!?\nMaya:\n...It's Misty Fey. The Master of the Kurain School of Channeling...\nPhoenix:\nAre... Are you sure?\nMaya:\nYes... The crest at the top of the scroll... That's the special mark of the Master of our tradition.\nPhoenix:\n(So that's what the mark means...)\nMaya:\n...\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it?\nMaya:\nN-Nothing... It's just that... I last saw her over 15 years ago... If it wasn't for that crest... I wouldn't have even known it was her. My own mother... And I can't even recognize her face.\nPhoenix:\nMaya...\nHanging Scroll added to the Court Record.\n\n\n\n\nHanging scroll (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's a hanging wall scroll showing Maya's mother, Misty Fey. It's not that old. That crest at the top is the official mark of the Master. I wonder if this temple has some sort of connection to \nthe Fey family...\nMaya:\nI think it does, actually. Supposedly, it was founded by a branch family member of the Kurain School.\nPhoenix:\n(I'll have to ask Bikini in more detail when I get the chance... About Maya... And the Fey family in general.)After examining hanging scroll in Inner Temple - Training Hall:February 7Dusky BridgeMaya:\nWhew, we managed to make it across Dusty Bridge.Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nNick, you look green. Are you feeling alright?Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nHey! What's wrong with you? Ever since we met Sister Iris at the Training Hall, you've been really quiet.Phoenix:\nHuh!? Oh, um. Sorry...???:\nHey, you! ...Wait up!Maya:\n...? You think he's yelling at us?Phoenix:\nHe must be. There's no one else around...???:\nWould you mind moving? You're standing right in my way. ... Ah!Maya:\nHey! I know you! You're...???:\nWhoa! Sorry! Gotta run! ...See ya!Phoenix:\nH-Hey! Wait a minute!???:\nOh, uh, nice to meet you. ...I'm Laurice Deauxnim.Phoenix:\nLiar! You're Larry! Your clothes may change, but you're still the Butz.Butz:\nShaddup! I'm... I'm... Lauriiiiice! And I'm just here to do a sketch of Dusky Bridge!Maya:\nSo... it really is our Larry. ...Not that I get why he's pretending to be someone else.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaurice Deauxnim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo what are you doing with the last name, \"Deauxnim\"?\nButz:\nWell I... I just... I wanted to start over again! With a clean slate!\nMaya:\nA clean slate...?\nButz:\nYou remember don't you? Last time?\nPhoenix:\n(The Mask☆DeMasque case...)\nButz:\nAfter that, I started to realize I didn't like this guy known as Larry Butz! And that's when I came across it... The book of destiny!\nMaya:\nThe \"book of destiny\"...? Do you mean...?\nButz:\n\"The Magic Bottle\"! By Ms. Elise Deauxnim! It's so beautiful... So moving... So... So gentle. My heart felt cleansed! I-I was saved!\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe I should buy a copy of \"The Magic Bottle\"...)\nMaya:\nWow, Larry would make a great book salesman! I really want to get that book now, too!\n\n\n\n\nElise Deauxnim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nShe's the most wonderful person I've ever met! I'd follow her anywhere!\nMaya:\nWell, she certainly is a very elegant lady.\nButz:\nYou see? You see? Here's a photo I took of her in secret!\nMaya:\nWow! That's a beautiful photo!\nButz:\nYou want a copy, don't you? It's OK... I just happened to have made extra prints!\nPhoto of Elise added to the Court Record.\n\n\n\n\nElise Deauxnim (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nShe's the most wonderful person I've ever met!

That's a beautiful photo!\n\n\n\n\nPicture books\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nStill, it's kinda hard to imagine you as a picture book illustrator... So tell the truth. You must have some kind of ulterior motive, right?\nButz:\nWh-What're you talking about!? I don't... I don't trust anyone anymore... Especially not women!\nMaya:\n...Talk about a bad case of denial.\nPhoenix:\nAnyway... Can you even draw well enough to make a picture book?\nButz:\nArt isn't only about technical skill, you know. It's also about having a pure heart!\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's why I'm asking. Can you draw well enough to make a whole book?\nButz:\n...! Hmm... Now that you mention it... I wonder.\nMaya:\nIt looks like you still have some doubt in your heart.\nButz:\nIt's true, I do... But when I first saw her, I felt it! Something inside me ended, and something else began.\nMaya:\nOh Larry, it sounds like you've fallen in love with Ms. Elise Deauxnim!\nButz:\nNo! Y-You're wrong! It's not her... It's the other girl!\nPhoenix:\n\"Other girl\"...? Uh oh... (I got a bad feeling about this...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nWow! You're even cuter than the last time I saw you.\nMaya:\nOh, really!?\nButz:\nYeah, you look like a totally different person! Don't you think so, Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe it's 'cause we're always together, but she looks pretty much the same to me.)\n\n\n\n\nMia Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nHey, I remember her! That's Maya's big sister!\nMaya:\nWow! You really do remember!\nButz:\nYeah, who could forget! A couple of gorgeous sisters! Hubba hubba!\nMaya:\nYou hear that, Nick! Gorgeous!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh yeah... That's right. When I defended Larry... Mia was still alive...)\n\n\n\n\nPearl Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nI haven't seen her in a while, so I bet she's gotten a lot bigger.\nPhoenix:\nWell, it's only been 5 months since we celebrated Ron's non-guilty verdict.\nButz:\nMaybe so, but kids these days grow up so fast.\nPhoenix:\n...She hasn't changed a bit as far as I can tell.\nButz:\nCome on, Nick... I really doubt that. You just don't know 'cause you don't pay enough attention, that's all.\nPhoenix:\n(Sometimes I really worry about what goes on inside this guy's head...)\n\n\n\n\nBikini profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nShe seems really motherly, doesn't she?\nButz:\nWhat do you mean \"seems\" motherly?

She's like a mother to me.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, you can tell from the kindness reflected in her eyes.\nButz:\nWhen I first looked into her eyes, I just couldn't help it. I started blabbing about all the bad things I had done in my life. She just laughed that gentle laugh of hers and listened!\nPhoenix:\n(Are you sure she wasn't just laughing at you...?)\n\n\n\n\nIris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nWhoo yeah! Her! My little Iris!\nMaya:\nShe's really pretty.\nButz:\nThis girl... She's perfect! She's exactly my type! I wonder if she would model for me. I want to draw a portrait of her.\nMaya:\nYeah, you always liked those model types, didn't you Larry? ...Hey, wait a sec! Didn't you say you were swearing off women...?\nButz:\nHuh!? Yeah, that's right. Of course I have! I have... basically. But...\nMaya:\n\"But\"...?\nButz:\nBut... Iris is different. I feel like... I feel like I still have one chance left at the dream...\nPhoenix:\n(This guy will never change.)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nHey, I know I may not look like it, but I'm an artist.

Pearly!Pearl:\nDinner preparations are complete! Please come quickly to the Main Hall!Maya:\nAlright! I can't wait to dig in, Pearly!Pearl:\nI'm going to go to the Inner Temple and call Sister Iris! I also want to have a look at where Mystic Maya is going to be training...February 7, 7:46 PMHazakura TempleMain HallMaya:\nBoy am I stuffed...Phoenix:\nAre you sure it's alright to eat that much before your training?Maya:\nWell, this kind of training is a battle of endurance.Pearl:\nMystic Maya... Please don't do anything that might put your health at risk.Maya:\nHa ha ha. No pain, no gain, I guess.Pearl:\nNngh... I'm still worried about you...Bikini:\nWell, well, well. Let's not dilly-dally shilly-shally. You must get ready for tonight.Elise:\nGood luck. ...Maya.Maya:\nAlright! Here I go! I'll see you all tomorrow, I guess!Bikini:\nIris, please ring the bell at 10:00 for lights out, alright?Iris:\nYes, Sister Bikini.Bikini:\nAnd then, after you ring the bell, I want you to come join us at the Training Hall.Iris:\nI understand, Sister Bikini.Phoenix:\n(Maya and Bikini really seem excited about this training thing tonight...)Elise:\n...Well, Pearl? What are you going to do tonight?Pearl:\nWell, umm...Elise:\nIf you'd like, you can come to my room. Perhaps we can read some books together.Pearl:\nR-Really!? I'd love to! I, umm... I'm not very good at reading.Elise:\nHa ha ha. Well then, would you like to practice reading with me?Pearl:\nAh! I'd love to!Phoenix:\n(Pearls is absolutely smitten with Ms. Deauxnim...) So Larry, what are you going to do?Butz:\nHuh... Me? Um, well... I'm just gonna hang out in my room. I can't stand the cold at all.Phoenix:\n(I totally hear you there.)Pearl:\nUm, Ms. Elise? So, for example, how do you read this?Elise:\nIt says, \"gravely\"... That's kind of a tough word.Pearl:\nOh! OK! And what about this word?Elise:\nThat's another tough one. It says, \"roast\".Phoenix:\n(What kind of a book is she reading anyway...?)Pearl:\nWell, I'm going to go wash the dishes and help clean up. I'll go visit you when I'm done, Ms. Elise!Phoenix:\n(Well, not much to do except head to my room and huddle under the covers, I guess...)February 7, 9:12 PMHazakura TempleMain HallPhoenix:\n(Ugh... It's a whole different type of cold up here in the mountains! Argh... Why couldn't the nearest bathroom be just a little closer to my room...?)???:\n...Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nYaaaaaaah! Oh! Ah, Ms. Deauxnim! Are you going to use the bathroom, too?Elise:\nUm, no. But... Have you seen Pearl?Phoenix:\nNo... Not since after dinner. I thought she said she was going to go to your room...Elise:\nI know... But she never showed up. I-I'm going to go look for her. ...Excuse me.Phoenix:\n(Ms. Elise Deauxnim... A woman as mysterious in origin as her last name... But... The really mysterious one is...)Iris:\nOh...Phoenix:\nAh...! S-Sister Iris...!Iris:\nG... G-Good evening...Phoenix:\n(The real mysterious one is this girl...!)Iris:\nUm, are you on your way to the bathroom too, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n(...I can't let this chance pass me by! I should try to talk with her... And maybe get some answers.)Move\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n...It's freezing cold out there. And dark, too.

You're Sister Iris, right?\nIris:\n...Yes.\nPhoenix:\nS-So... um, when did you come to Hazakura Temple?\nIris:\n... I don't remember. Ever since I was a small child, the temple has been my home.\nPhoenix:\nSo you've never left?\nIris:\nWell, I don't have any family left to take care of me... Sister Bikini... I've come to think of her as my real mother, as it were.\nPhoenix:\nAh, I see... But you... Didn't you go to college? ...And maybe enroll with the Ivy University Literature Department?\nIris:\nNo, I never had an interest in going to a big university like that... My training is all the education I need.\nPhoenix:\nI... I see...\nIris:\nBut... Once in a while, when I get the chance, I make a trip to the nearby town. I can use a computer and a cell phone, too.\nPhoenix:\n... (That's not exactly something worth bragging about... But I don't see any Psyche-Locks... ...so I guess that means she's not lying...)\nIris:\nP-Please don't stare at me like that...\n\n\n\n\nHazakura Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of a place is this anyway? I heard it's for training to increase your spiritual power or something like that.\nIris:\nIt must seem awfully crazy to normal people like you.\nPhoenix:\nWell, I have to admit it is a whole different world up here...\nIris:\nI'm glad to hear you say that.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nIris:\nTalking with dead people... Who does it help anyway? ...I hate it.\nPhoenix:\nR-Really?

I have to go and ring the bell for lights out...Phoenix:\n(I guess it's almost 10:00 now, huh?)Iris:\n... Um... Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n...Yes?Iris:\nIf it's alright with you... I would like you to have this.Phoenix:\nBut this is your hood...Iris:\nIt has the power to protect you from evil spirits.Phoenix:\n(Come to think of it, Sister Bikini was wearing one of these, too...)Iris:\nI pray for your safety on this dark, cold night.Iris's Hood received from Iris.Iris:\nI'm sorry, but I must bid you goodnight.Phoenix:\nWait a minute, Sister Iris...Iris:\nY-Yes...?Phoenix:\nJust now, you called me by my name... You said, \"Mr. Wright\". How did you know my name? I never introduced myself to you.Iris:\nTh-That's...Phoenix:\n...Sister Iris. Please, tell me the truth. You and I...

Maya... and Iris's Bikini... ...Huh? Say something, Edgey!Edgeworth:\n...Before I came here, I stopped in at the hospital where Wright is. I believe I have a better understanding of the situation than you, at this point. The murder victim was the picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. She was found by Wright and the head nun. The suspect is the temple's younger nun. Then later, while Wright was crossing the bridge, it broke and he fell into the river. The hospital says that he'll need at least 2 days of bed rest.Butz:\nY-Yes! Th-That's right! You got it! B-But they arrested her... My sweet little Iris!Edgeworth:\n(And here I was, convinced HE was the one the police had arrested...) However... I still don't understand what these two items are for.Butz:\nWhat are you talking about?Edgeworth:\nThey're things Wright gave to me when I was leaving his room. (This is the first... He said some nonsense about being able to see into people's hearts with this... And the other... He couldn't possibly be asking what I think he is... could he?)Butz:\nI'm begging you! Iris's trial starts tomorrow! With Nick out of the picture, you're all I've got left! You're the only one that can represent her!Edgeworth:\n... What did you just say?Butz:\nYou know! REPRESENT! DEFEND! What were you expecting!? Why do you think I called you anyway!?Edgeworth:\n...I'm a prosecutor, Larry. A prosecutor. Do YOU understand what I'm saying? A prosecutor is a lawyer who...Butz:\nDon't talk to me like a kid! I graduated from junior high, you know! Don't worry about it! I promise I won't tell!Edgeworth:\nBut I...Butz:\nI mean, I heard a paper badge had no problem fooling an entire court before!Edgeworth:\n(...How could this country's judicial system have fallen into such decay!?)Butz:\nPlease, Edgey! At least listen to her... Listen to Iris's side of the story!Edgeworth:\n(So Wright wasn't joking when he gave me this badge after all...)Iris:\nThank you for coming. ...My name is Iris.Edgeworth:\n...Edgeworth.

Mr. Laurice said that he... That he might even die...Edgeworth:\n... Fortunately, he will be fine. (Larry, you moron! How could you say something like that!?) He was badly bruised when he hit the water, but otherwise he is unharmed.Iris:\n... Thank goodness...Edgeworth:\nBut, he's caught some kind of nasty cold.Iris:\nA cold...?Edgeworth:\nHe's running a high fever and is drifting in and out of consciousness.Iris:\n...Edgeworth:\n(I must be imagining things.

What's that?\nIris:\nIt's a place where those who wish to boost their spiritual power come to train. You need to undergo some very difficult training to release your inner spiritual power.\nEdgeworth:\nSpiritual power...? Did you go to that temple for that reason as well?\nIris:\nNo... I don't have any spiritual powers. I don't need them.\nEdgeworth:\nIn that case, what are you doing at that temple then?\nIris:\n... I... I've committed some sins. Sins that I need to pay for. That's why I'm there, and why I continue to train... To purify my soul.\n\n\n\n\nThe night of the crime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI want to ask you about last night... The night of the crime.\nIris:\nAlright... I helped to clean up after dinner, and then went back to my room at about 8:00. Later, I left my room to ring the lights out bell at 10:00.\nEdgeworth:\nBell...?\nIris:\n...We ring it at the same time each night.\nEdgeworth:\nI see... And then?\nIris:\nA-And then...\nEdgeworth:\n...?\nIris:\nI was told to go to the Training Hall, but... I went back to my room... and stayed there...\nEdgeworth:\nWhy didn't you go to the Training Hall like you were asked to?\nIris:\n...I-I was frightened.\nEdgeworth:\n(\"Frightened\"...?)\nIris:\nSo I just stayed in my room and meditated... until the murder happened.\nEdgeworth:\n(There's more to her story.  I just know there is. Maybe  I should dig a little deeper.)\n\n\n\n\nFrightened? (appears after \"The night of the crime\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou were asked to go to the Training Hall on the night of the murder?\nIris:\nYes...\nEdgeworth:\nHowever... You didn't go. Because you say you were frightened. What exactly were you so frightened of?\nIris:\n...!\n\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Wh-What in the world!?)\nIris:\nUm... Is there something wrong?\nEdgeworth:\n...I'm sorry. It's nothing. (It looks like she's not aware of them herself... These must be what Wright was talking about... The \"Psycholocks\"! I believe he said that I need to present this \"Magatama\" item to do something...)\nIris:\n...?\n\n\n\n\nFrightened? (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nI... I don't like to walk alone at night. And, last night was...\nEdgeworth:\nWhat about last night?\n\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n\nIris:\nEr, oh... nothing. It's rather silly...\nEdgeworth:\nSo there was something special about last night, hmm?\nIris:\nNngh...\nEdgeworth:\n(It looks like I have no choice but to break these locks...)\n\n\n\n\nAny idea? (before clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night?\nIris:\n...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed.\nEdgeworth:\nSpiritual power...?\nIris:\nYes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example...\nEdgeworth:\n...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science. I don't believe in \"spiritual power\".\nIris:\nYes... I understand. Most people don't.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd I am certain that the thing that killed the victim was a human. So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim?\nIris:\n... No. I'm not the one who took her life.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... (That was foolish of me... It's not as if I can know for certain if she is telling me the truth...)\n\n\n\n\nAny idea? (after clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night?\nIris:\n...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed.\nEdgeworth:\nSpiritual power...?\nIris:\nYes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example...\nEdgeworth:\n...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science.

So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim?\nIris:\n... No. I'm not the one who took her life.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... (Those Psycholock things aren't appearing... I suppose that means I can believe that she's not lying.) ...Heh.\nIris:\nWhat's wrong?\nEdgeworth:\n(I can't believe what I'm thinking... And here I just finished saying that I don't believe in spiritual power...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nIs that an attorney's badge?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, this belongs to Wright.\nIris:\nReally?\nEdgeworth:\nI'm actually a prosecutor.\nIris:\nOh...! Then why do you have a defense attorney's badge pinned on your lapel...?\nEdgeworth:\nWell, you see... I, um... I borrowed it.\n\n\n\n\nHanging Scroll\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWho is the woman on this hanging scroll?\nIris:\nWell, I don't know the details, but... I've heard she's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique.\nEdgeworth:\nM-Master?\nIris:\nYes. Mystic Misty. She was a great spirit medium. ...That's what I've heard. I also heard that she went missing over 15 years ago.\nEdgeworth:\n... Spirit mediums... There's no such thing anyway...\nIris:\nMr. Edgeworth...?\nEdgeworth:\nI know all about them... They're nothing but frauds!\nIris:\n...?\nEdgeworth:\n(She doesn't know anything about it, of course... But there was a time, 17 years ago, when I met the \"Master\" myself...)\n\n\n\n\nIris's Hood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nThat's called a \"Demon-Warding Hood\". ...I gave that to Mr. Wright last night.\nEdgeworth:\nHe was wearing this when I saw him at the hospital today.\nIris:\nIt's an important item for protecting acolytes from evil spirits.\nEdgeworth:\nIf it's so important, then why did you give it to him?\nIris:\nLast night... I felt... something... I felt that something terrible was about to happen... I... I didn't want Mr. Wright to fall into its grip.\nEdgeworth:\n(Well he wound up falling into something much deeper and colder... I probably shouldn't say that out loud, though. Thank god for inner monologue.)\n\n\n\n\n\"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\n...I was against the idea of our temple appearing in that magazine. I was afraid that... this type of a tragedy might occur.\nEdgeworth:\nIn that case, why did you allow them to run an article about you?\nIris:\nIt was Sister Bikini... She's actually rather fond of attention... Surprisingly so.\nEdgeworth:\n(She certainly does look rather happy in this photo...)\n\n\n\n\nPhoto of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nThat's Mystic Elise Deauxnim. She's a picture book author, or so I've heard.\nEdgeworth:\nDoes she come to Hazakura Temple often...?\nIris:\nNo... This was her first time. It's just that...\nEdgeworth:\n...?\nIris:\nShe was a very important visitor.\nEdgeworth:\nIs that so?\nIris:\nYes, Sister Bikini told me, \"Be certain not to offend her.\"\nEdgeworth:\n(The victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim... The prosecutor's office still doesn't have much information about her it seems...)\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix Wright profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nMr. Wright... How bad is his cold?\nEdgeworth:\nWell his fever is very high. As a result, he's rather confused. He's worried about Maya, who is still trapped in the Inner Temple... ...And he's quite worried about you as well, it seems.\nIris:\n...Really?\nEdgeworth:\nYes... Naturally, once he recovers, I'll pass the baton back to him.\nIris:\nNo... Don't... I'm sure that Mr. Wright wouldn't want that... He wouldn't want to defend me.\n\n\n\n\nLarry Butz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nOh... That's Mr. Laurice.\nEdgeworth:\n...I'm sorry? Who did you say it was?\nIris:\nLaurice Deauxnim. He is Mystic Elise's apprentice, I think.\nEdgeworth:\n(Alright... Now who exactly is this guy...?)\nIris:\nHe's a very sincere, hard-working person.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nIris:\nUm... Did I say something wrong, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nE-Excuse me. I was temporarily at a loss for words. (Take a trip... Come home... Be thrust suddenly into bizarro world...)\n\n\n\n\nIris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nYou want to know about me? There's not much to tell, I'm afraid.\nEdgeworth:\nJust let me get one thing straight. You were raised at Hazakura Temple, correct? And yet, somehow, you seem to know Wright.\nIris:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nSo you two must have crossed paths somewhere.\nIris:\n...No, Mr. Edgeworth. Whomever it was... ...it couldn't have been me.\nEdgeworth:\n(What is that supposed to mean?)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nI'm sorry... I don't leave the temple grounds very often... So I don't know very much about the outside world.After clearing all Talk options:Edgeworth:\nHmm... It appears that's about all that you can tell me.Iris:\nThank you very much for listening to my story.Edgeworth:\n...I visited Wright at the hospital before coming here. He asked me to take care of you...Iris:\n...M-Me?Edgeworth:\nYes, at the trial tomorrow... He asked me to defend you.Iris:\n... If Mr. Wright has that much faith in you, Mr. Edgeworth... ...Then I will gladly entrust my fate in your capable hands.Edgeworth:\nBut before that, I have one question.Iris:\nYes?Edgeworth:\nDo you know Wright?Iris:\nEr... Wh-Why would you ask that?Edgeworth:\nWhenever you came up in our conversation, he would begin to act a little... strange.Iris:\n... Mr. Edgeworth... What is Mr. Wright to you? (Changed from [Mr. Edgeworth... Are you his friend?] in the original release)Edgeworth:\n...He is a very dear and indispensable friend. (Changed from [Friend? Well... In a sense, yes.] in the original release)Iris:\n... It was 5 years ago... That's when I... That's when I... deceived him.Edgeworth:\nYou \"deceived\" him...?Iris:\nI heard that he was... in a lot of pain after what happened. I know what a weak person I am. That's why... That's why I thought it was best if he never saw me again. I wanted him to just forget about me, without learning the truth.Edgeworth:\n... Well, if you ask me, Wright is still suffering... And until he learns the truth, I don't think he will ever be able to truly recover. ...Iris. It's not too late. You should go to him. ...Tell him the truth.Iris:\n...Edgeworth:\nI'll defend you, but only if you agree to that one condition.Iris:\n... Alright, Mr. Edgeworth... I promise.Edgeworth:\n...Very well. I'll do everything in my power to get you an acquittal. (That's enough information gathering for now. I should head to the crime scene...)February 8Dusky BridgeEdgeworth:\n(It sure is cold alright... So this is it... Dusky Bridge...)???:\nOh, wow! It's you, Mr. Edgeworth! (Changed from [Ahem! M-Mr. Edgeworth!] in the original release)Edgeworth:\nNngh... Detective Gumshoe. (Changed from [Urk... Detective Gumshoe.] in the original release)Gumshoe:\nLong time no see! It's been about a year? ...Or has it been longer?Edgeworth:\nIt doesn't matter, Detective. What does matter is why you're shuffling around up here.Gumshoe:\nOh, ouch! ...And there's that sharp left jab! (Changed from [Oh, ouch! ...And there was a sharp left jab!] in the original release) Well, I'm happy to see you anyway, Mr. Edgeworth!Edgeworth:\nLet me guess... You were transferred by HR to the local precinct? (Changed from [Let me guess... You were transferred into another section at work.] in the original release) A wise decision. The vast amount of nothing up here should be quite easy to guard. (Changed from [A good choice. The vast amount of nothing up here must be quite easy to guard.] in the original release)Gumshoe:\nI heard you were back in the country and arranged to come all the way out here! Everybody was real nice. They even let me take charge of the investigation, sir.Edgeworth:\n(...Gumshoe indeed! Like gum on your shoe, he's impossible to get rid of!)Gumshoe:\nI'm supposed to report on the details of the crime scene, sir! Anyway! Here I am! Detective Dick Gumshoe! Reporting for duty!Edgeworth:\n...Great. Um, thank you, Detective.Gumshoe:\nI thought Prosecutor Godot was gonna get here before me. That guy's a real mystery, I tell you!Edgeworth:\n(...Prosecutor Godot?)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCliff on other side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt looks like a pretty good distance to that far cliff.\nGumshoe:\nYeah... It's gotta be around 100 yards or so.\nEdgeworth:\n... Detective... That's not even CLOSE to a hundred yards.\nGumshoe:\nWell... I gotta admit I'm not very good at judging distances.\nEdgeworth:\n(It's about 20 yards or so. And impossible to cross without a bridge, it seems...)\n\n\n\n\nWooden sign on left side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThere's a little shack down that way called, \"Heavenly Hall\".\nEdgeworth:\nA shack...?\nGumshoe:\nIt's like a run-down doghouse for losers that can't bear the freezing drafts of wind... Kinda reminds me of my apartment, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nThe name \"Heavenly Hall\" makes it sound like a palace...\nGumshoe:\nGiving a hovel a great name is a crime itself! I'd call it false advertising! By the way, the name of my apartment complex is \"Compton Castles\"...\nEdgeworth:\n...That's not such a great name, if you ask me.\nGumshoe:\nWell, it's not such a great apartment either, sir.\n\n\n\n\nBridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo this is the bridge Wright tried to cross?\nGumshoe:\nPretty reckless, if you ask me.\nEdgeworth:\nI'm amazed he survived the fall from up here...\nGumshoe:\nYeah, he's one lucky guy, sir. Now I see how he manages to win his cases in court. Blind luck.\nEdgeworth:\n(I think dumb luck suits Wright just a bit better.)\n\n\n\n\nBoulder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSome letters are wildly engraved into a roughly cut boulder. \"Dusky Bridge\"... It certainly is an appropriate name.\nGumshoe:\nYou need to get some glasses, Mr. Edgeworth! That sign says, \"Dusty Bridge\". I can see how you read it wrong, though, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nYou're the one who needs glasses, Detective. Try reading it one more time.\nGumshoe:\n... Ah! You're right! It's \"Dusky Bridge\" after all! ... I guess whoever wrote this made a mistake!\n\n\n\n\nPublic phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nHey! It's a public phone! You don't see a lot of these anymore!\nEdgeworth:\n...That's true.\nGumshoe:\nSince we've got one here, why don't we take a photo as a memento!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, um, sure. Why not?\nGumshoe:\nOh, darn it! I don't have a camera with me! ...I'm gonna go buy a disposable camera! I'll be right back, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n(What's so special about public phones, and why is he so fascinated by them...?)Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened (before visitng Main Hall)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case...\nGumshoe:\nIt's simple!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, simple is as simple does, as they say.\nGumshoe:\nOh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing!\nEdgeworth:\nA witness...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that Bikini lady.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Bikini lady\"? Here? On this freezing cold mountain?\nGumshoe:\n...Well, you should talk to her yourself if you want the details, sir.\nEdgeworth:\n(I may have to talk to this \"bikini lady\"... I mean, \"decisive witness\" myself...)\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened (after visitng Main Hall)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case...\nGumshoe:\nIt's simple!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, simple is as simple does, as they say.\nGumshoe:\nOh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing!\nEdgeworth:\nA witness...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that Bikini lady.\n\n\n\n\nDusky Bridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo this is the bridge that Wright fell through?\nGumshoe:\nYup! I can't imagine being that reckless myself... \"Look before you cross,\" is how it goes, right? Or was that \"leap\"...?\nEdgeworth:\nAnd? Is there something on the other side?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, some old building they call the Inner Temple... But we can't get over there without a bridge, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat...?\nGumshoe:\nNobody lives there, so it's usually not a problem... But someone was at the Inner Temple doing some training and now they're stuck there.\nEdgeworth:\nYes, I heard that from Wright. It's Maya Fey.\nGumshoe:\nOh no... Her again...? Anyway, the air's really turbulent right now so we can't do an aerial extraction. No one's gonna be able to reach the Inner Temple until tomorrow, sir.\nEdgeworth:\n(Will she be alright in this cold...?) So how did this bridge burn down anyway?\nGumshoe:\nWe're almost 100% sure it was lightning.\nEdgeworth:\n...Lightning?\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor Godot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo who is this Prosecutor Godot? I've never heard of him.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, he's a new guy... Showed up after you left the country! He's a complete rookie, but nobody can say a bad word about the guy.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat kind of a man is he?\nGumshoe:\nHe just became a prosecutor recently, but he's good, sir. Real good.\nEdgeworth:\n(If he's so good, how is it that I've never heard of him...?) Is he the lead prosecutor on this case?\nGumshoe:\nYou bet he is! After all, \"you know who\" is right in the middle of it.\nEdgeworth:\n\"You know who\"?\nGumshoe:\nPhoenix Wright, of course! For some reason, Godot has really got it in for Mr. Wright!\nEdgeworth:\nOh?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, he seems to have some kind of a grudge.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd what would be the cause of this grudge...?\nGumshoe:\nI dunno... Maybe he made fun of his mask or something.\nEdgeworth:\n(None of this is making any sense. I'd better look into this Godot myself.)\n\n\n\n\nLightning (appears after \"Dusky Bridge\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning?\nGumshoe:\nYup. Last night it snowed for the first time in 3 days. It's a little unusual for lightning to occur during a snow fall like that... But according to the weather data, lightning definitely struck.\nWeather Data added to the Court Record.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm, I see... This is a very detailed weather report... Almost too detailed... It even has the exact time that the lightning struck the bridge...\nGumshoe:\nOh, that? We got that information from the witness's testimony.\nEdgeworth:\nSomeone actually saw the lightning hit the bridge? Who is this witness?\nGumshoe:\n... Sorry. I'll go ask one of the local cops later, sir.\n\n\n\n\nLightning (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning?\nGumshoe:\nYup.

What's that thing doing on your lapel, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n...Is it really that odd?\nGumshoe:\nYou bet it is, sir! A prosecutor wearing a defense attorney's badge? That's like a detective with a license to kill!\nEdgeworth:\n(Does this little thing hold that ominous of a meaning...?)\n\n\n\n\nMagatama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHave you ever seen this thing before...?\nGumshoe:\nHey, thanks a lot. I was getting kind of hungry! ...*chomp!*\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What are you doing, Detective!?\nGumshoe:\nAck! ...I thought it was some kind of candy that would fill me up, sir. Lately I've been feeling so hungry all the time...\nEdgeworth:\n(Nngh... Maybe his salary has been cut just a little too much...?)\n\n\n\n\nPhoto of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThere's a lot we don't know about this victim... We don't know her real name, her background... We don't know anything really.\nEdgeworth:\nThat's rather odd... If she was trying to hide her identity, why would she become an author?\nGumshoe:\nI'll bet it was just one of those things. You know... She probably never expected to get so popular.\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix Wright profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nWhenever something happens, this guy always shows up like he hasn't got a care. In fact, you know what...? Every time he shows up, I always wonder the same thing. \"Maybe somehow he's actually the cause of all these incidents!\"\nEdgeworth:\n(I wonder if Gumshoe has realized it yet... But you could say the exact the same thing about him!)\n\n\n\n\nDick Gumshoe profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYour face is more drawn out than the last time I saw you over a year ago.\nGumshoe:\nR-Really? I thought so!\nEdgeworth:\nNo, wait... It's not so much \"drawn out\", as \"weary and tired\", or maybe just plain old \"thin\".\nGumshoe:\nI thought that too, sir. My salary's been kinda on the low end... So yeah, my food options have been kinda non-existent. Off-brand chicken soup, off-brand spaghetti, off-brand bread... That sort of stuff.\nEdgeworth:\nI thought you were really into instant noodles last year...?\nGumshoe:\n...I got really sick of the stuff after a while, sir.\n\n\n\n\nLarry Butz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nHe's supposed to be Ms. Elise Deauxnim's apprentice or something.\nEdgeworth:\n...I see.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, he drew a nice portrait of me.\nEdgeworth:\n...That's nice.\nGumshoe:\nBut he made me pay him 50 cents for it.\nEdgeworth:\n...I'm sorry about that.\nGumshoe:\n... You don't seem very interested in him, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\n...I really don't want to talk about him. That's why.\n\n\n\n\nIris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI feel like I've seen this girl somewhere before! She wasn't from a prior case, was she?\nGumshoe:\nNope, can't be. We did a database search with her fingerprints and came up with nothing.\nEdgeworth:\nI see... (I just can't shake this nagging feeling...)\nGumshoe:\nWell, everyone knows that you are quite popular with the ladies, sir... Maybe she's an old girlfriend that you sent to Dumpsville when you were younger.\nEdgeworth:\nD-Detective! Where did you hear such nonsense from!?\nGumshoe:\nI didn't hear it from anyone. It's just sorta how I imagine you to be... sir.\nEdgeworth:\n(...D-Do I really inspire this sort of frothing desire from the female masses?)\n\n\n\n\nGodot profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI usually hear about promising young prosecutor candidates while they're still in school. But I've never seen or heard of this person.\nGumshoe:\nI gotta admit... He's puzzling alright. He just appeared one day, big mug of steaming coffee in his hand...\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... He sounds like an interesting man...\nGumshoe:\nYeah... The whole prosecutor's office is really into double espresso macchiatos lately.\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nLook, I'm just your everyday, simple detective. Don't ask me such tough questions, OK?\nEdgeworth:\n...That's not something to be proud of, Detective!February 8Detention CenterVisitor's RoomEdgeworth:\n(It looks like Iris is being interrogated right now.) ...This place certainly brings back memories.Gumshoe:\nOh yeah. Come to think of it, you got thrown in here once too, didn't you, sir? But you know what? I've never been in jail a single time!Edgeworth:\n(I should think it's hard to land in jail when you're so harmless...) Yes, well... If you're in jail, you don't have to pay for your own meals, you know.Gumshoe:\n...*gasp!* ...Edgeworth:\nDon't get any funny ideas, Detective...!Gumshoe:\n...Too late, I already did.Edgeworth:\n(In any case... I guess I'll have to come back here later...)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurveillance camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThat camera is meant to monitor everything that happens in here. And right now, it's pointed straight at the guard.\n\n\n\n\nGuard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe guard is staring at me with a puzzled expression on his face. Me... and the badge on my lapel. ...I get the feeling he recognizes me.February 8Hazakura TempleMain GateButz:\nYo! Edgey! What took you so long!? I'm so cold, my brain's turned to sherbet.Edgeworth:\n...I knew it was a mistake to race back to this country.Butz:\nWh-What do you mean...?Edgeworth:\nWright is going to be fine, and the case itself isn't anything unusual... And I find myself taking a request to defend a woman accused of murder!Gumshoe:\n...H-Hey! Wait a sec! Hold it! Objection! What's going on here, Mr. Edgeworth!?Edgeworth:\nUm, it's hard to explain, but one thing led to another and...Butz:\nWhat kind of lame excuse is that!? And you call yourself a defense attorney!?Gumshoe:\nProsecutor Edgeworth is a prosecutor, and that's why he's Prosecutor Edgeworth! \"Prosecutor Edgeworth, Defense Attorney\" just sounds plain old weird, pal! ...Right, Prosecutor Edgeworth!?Edgeworth:\n(...I'm not sure what role I'm supposed to be playing anymore.)Butz:\nHmph!

I just know it, OK!? So trust me on this one!Edgeworth:\nEver the romantic, aren't you, Larry? Nevertheless, I'll do whatever I can to prove her innocence.

You got a real flair for words, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nI have always appreciated this kind of old, timeless elegance.\nGumshoe:\nThat's exactly how I feel, too! Take this coat for example! Like a fine wine, it gets better with age!\nEdgeworth:\nEven fine wine turns to vinegar and begins to stink at some point. ...I suggest you wash that atrocious rag you call a coat, Detective.\n\n\n\n\nMain Hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThat must be the Main Hall back there.\nGumshoe:\nA brilliant deduction, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n............ Are you trying to flatter me, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nUmm... A brilliant use of suspense to build the tension, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n(According to Wright, the head nun has some important information. I can't miss the opportunity to speak with her...)\n\n\n\n\nBell tower\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI can see a small bell tower from here.\nGumshoe:\nHey, that just reminded me! There's something I've always wondered about...\nEdgeworth:\n(Something tells me he's going to tell me what's on his mind, whether I like it or not...)\nGumshoe:\nWe call a person who tells a lie a \"liar\", right? So why don't we call a person who rings a bell a \"beller\"? Or \"truer\" for a guy who tells the truth! Oh man, I'm not gonna get any sleep tonight!\nEdgeworth:\n(I had no idea he was such a deep thinker...)\n\n\n\n\nSnowmobile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI suppose this type of thing is necessary up here in the mountains.\nGumshoe:\nSay, this just gave me a great idea!\nEdgeworth:\n(Something tells me he's going to tell me what's on his mind, whether I like it or not...)\nGumshoe:\nI've got an idea for a brand new invention! It might even make me rich!\nEdgeworth:\nAn invention...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah! A car that can travel on snow! I'll call it a \"Snow Car\"!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nGumshoe:\nSo what do you think, sir? Would you go for a ride on something like that?\nEdgeworth:\n...Only after you take the first 1000 test rides.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nMan, I'm telling you. Iris is so cute! Right, Edgey? You think so too, don't you?\nEdgeworth:\n...\nButz:\nWhat's wrong? Why are you so quiet?\nEdgeworth:\nTo put it simply...Your comment has me highly concerned. Could it be that the reason you think she's innocent...\nButz:\nCome on! A girl that cute can't possibly be a murderer!\nEdgeworth:\n... ...I was right after all. I should never have come back.\nButz:\nNo, no! Don't worry! I see things for how they really are this time! Honest!\nEdgeworth:\n(If I had a penny for every time he's said that...)\nButz:\nIt's just that... Well, Iris is a delicate flower. You can't force things too much. Know what I mean?\nEdgeworth:\nHuh...? I have no idea what you're talking about, Larry.\nButz:\nOh. ...Ah! Err. Forget it.

I'm just a 25 year old jobless bum trying to be an apprentice artist!\nEdgeworth:\n(If that's what you think, then get a job already!)\nButz:\nD-Don't look at me like that! I thought we were pals!\n\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n\nEdgeworth:\nIf we're friends then I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't hide the truth from me!\nButz:\nHmph, well... Sure... It's like, you know!

After all, I saved his life.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is that supposed to mean?\nButz:\nIf I hadn't called for help so quickly, he would have died. It's no surprise though. I used to be a security guard. It was all instinct, baby!\nEdgeworth:\n(He has a point... He called me pretty quickly, too... I think Larry's pretty good at motivating people. I just wish he would try motivating himself once in a while!)\n\n\n\n\nLarry Butz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nHuh? Me?

You were a guy once! Lots of girls are like Iris. You know I'm right!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, you most certainly seem to have convinced yourself!\nButz:\nMan, I love shy girls like her!

A handsome boy such as yourself is always welcome! *sigh* If circumstances weren't so tragic, I might just...Edgeworth:\n(Please don't call me \"boy\".) I'm sorry to trouble you... But I'm looking for a woman in a bikini.Bikini:\nWell, you have found her. Now, what can I do for you?Edgeworth:\n... I'm sorry, but I don't see any bikinis...Bikini:\nHa ha ha! If you ask nicely, I might give you a peek, big boy. Wa ha ha ho ho ho!Gumshoe:\nUmm... Mr. Edgeworth? This is the head nun, Sister Bikini... She's the witness.Edgeworth:\n... Why didn't you tell me that earlier!? This is exactly why your salary keeps on getting cut!Gumshoe:\nNngh... My stomach is already growling in protest...Bikini:\nSo... Um... What's the latest about my beloved Iris!?Edgeworth:\nWell, first... I want to hear what you know.Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWalls or sliding doors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere's flowing script written everywhere on the walls.\nGumshoe:\nMan, I'd bet you'd have awful nightmares if you tried to sleep in here.\nBikini:\nThis is our Main Hall, so it's protected by a variety of magic spells and charms... They're all designed to prevent evil forces from entering.\nGumshoe:\nSo if I slept here the uggie-woogie-boogieman wouldn't hunt me down for eternity? Alright!\nEdgeworth:\n(Does this guy think about anything other than eating and sleeping...?)\n\n\n\n\nObjects on floor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nOh! It's a warmed cat box! But where are all the cats?\nEdgeworth:\n...It's called a \"hibachi\". It's for heating the room.\nGumshoe:\nOh! Look at all these ancient straw frisbees!\nEdgeworth:\nThose are a type of \"zabuton\" cushions called \"enza\"!\nGumshoe:\n... Why are you giving me such a hard time? Huh, Mr. Edgeworth? Why?\nEdgeworth:\nBecause learning something new might actually be a good thing for you, Detective!\n\n\n\n\nAltar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt's an altar with a giant Magatama enshrined on it.\nGumshoe:\nThere are lots of candles lined up on it, too. You know... I haven't had a birthday party for myself in a while...\nEdgeworth:\nMaybe you should blow out those candles over there to make up for that.\nGumshoe:\nMr. Edgeworth? Would you mind singing \"Happy Birthday\" to me?\nBikini:\nS-Stop that! Cut that out! Please don't blow out the altar candles!\n\n\n\n\nMagatama on altar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...That thing sure casts a strong presence over the whole room.\nBikini:\nThis is the \"Lesser Magatama\". It's a precious heirloom containing a great many souls.\nGumshoe:\nHuh...!? This is \"lesser\"!? What is the \"greater\" one like?\nBikini:\nThe \"Greater Magatama\" is displayed in the Main Room of Fey Manor. It was supposed to be shown at the Treasures of Kurain exhibit... But, it was so large that they couldn't bring it through the doors.\n\n\n\n\nLeft corner near altar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(There are more enza cushions in the corner of the room.) ...What's that white piece of paper sticking out from under that stack...?\nGumshoe:\nHmm... Beats me.\nEdgeworth:\nWould you mind checking that for me, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir! Here you are, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nIt looks like an old manila envelope...\nGumshoe:\nEeeeeeeeeeaaaah!!\nEdgeworth:\n...What is it, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nTh-This... This could be it! An ultra important clue! A super-special clue!\nEdgeworth:\n...I suppose I should read it myself then.\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like a letter addressed to Sister Iris. \"tonight at 10 at Heavenly Hall. ... ...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed.\"\nEdgeworth:\nTh-This sounds like a blackmail letter...!\nNote to Iris added to the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\nNice going there, Mr. Edgeworth! Why can't I ever find clues like that!? You're an ultra-important prosecutor!! A super-duper prosecutor!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, I suppose it takes a super-duper kind of dumb to miss a clue like this.\n\n\n\n\nLeft corner near altar (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(There are more enza cushions in the corner of the room.)\nGumshoe:\nNice going there, Mr. Edgeworth!

After dinner, the two of us went to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple.\nEdgeworth:\n(She must be talking about Maya...) Approximately what time was that...?\nBikini:\nI suppose it was about 9:00 when we left here. Training lasts all night long. It's extremely exhausting. The channeling dojo's Head Nun must be in attendance at all times to keep watch.\nGumshoe:\nWow, you're right! That does sound exhausting!\nEdgeworth:\nDetective, this is no time for flattery.\nGumshoe:\nSorry.\nEdgeworth:\nSome time around 11:00, you witnessed the incident in the courtyard. But your duty was in the Inner Temple. Why did you come back here?\nBikini:\nHmm... The way you're staring at me, I'm starting to get goosebumps! Ha ha ha ho ho!\nEdgeworth:\n(Nngh... I'm starting to get goosebumps myself, but for a decidedly different reason.)\nGumshoe:\nHo ho, you get the chills pretty easy, don't you Mr. Edgeworth?\n\n\n\n\nWhat you saw\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAlright then... I'd like you to tell me exactly what you saw in the courtyard.\nBikini:\nIt must have been past 11:00. Ah! No! I can't say it! It-It's too much for my poor heart!\nGumshoe:\nHey! Calm down, lady! L-Let go of my tie!\nBikini:\n...I saw two people! One of them was lying on the ground... Th-The other one was stabbing her from the back... with a sword!\nEdgeworth:\nDid you see this criminal with your own eyes?\nBikini:\nI didn't want to believe what I was seeing...! ...But it was Iris!\nEdgeworth:\nYou must have been quite shocked.\nGumshoe:\nOf course she was! Try putting yourself in her shoes! It'd be like if you were stabbing Mr. Wright smack in the middle of a courtroom! And I happened to witness it from the witness stand! ...I'd be pretty shocked too.\nBikini:\nI know it sounds insane... But that's what I saw. And when I finally realized what I was seeing, I screamed, and then... I passed out.\nEdgeworth:\n(...Unfortunately for us, her testimony seems to be pretty solid.)\nBikini:\nHowever... The idea of Iris doing such a foul act seems... unnatural.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Unnatural\"...?\nBikini:\nThe girl I know simply isn't capable of this sort of foulness...\nEdgeworth:\n(...I wonder what she means by that?)\n\n\n\n\nWhy return? (appears after \"The night of the crime\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAs the head nun, it's your duty to stay with the acolyte at all times, correct?\nBikini:\nYes, that's correct. I know I may look strong, but the truth is... I've got a bad lower back.\nEdgeworth:\nA bad lower back...?\nBikini:\nYes, it's especially bad in the winter. So bad that I can't even lift a bucket. Do you remember how cold it was last night? My bad back felt as stiff as frozen glass. I just wanted to take a nice hot bath to ease my aching back... That's why I returned to the Main Hall.\nEdgeworth:\nSo you left the disciple all alone?\nBikini:\nDon't be ridiculous! I would never do that! That's why I ordered Iris to the Inner Temple after she had rung the bell for lights out.\nEdgeworth:\n(Yes, but she never went to the Inner Temple, did she? So did this head nun actually see Iris there? (Changed from [Did this head nun even see Iris?] in the original release) I think I'd better try to get some more details...)\n\n\n\n\nThe acolyte (appears after \"What you saw\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo who is this acolyte that was to train at the Inner Temple...?\nBikini:\nHer name is Maya Fey... I treated her very badly, I'm ashamed to say. And after she went through the trouble of signing up for the Special Course...\nGumshoe:\n\"Special Course\"?\nBikini:\nIt's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant 30,000 times...\nEdgeworth:\nYou don't mean to tell me she's still doing that over at the Inner Temple, do you?\nBikini:\nNo, no, no. Of course not! You don't have to worry about that one little bit. Last night, we still hadn't started the training session itself.\nEdgeworth:\nWell, um... That's good to hear.\nBikini:\n...Oh! Dear, dear! There's one thing I forgot to tell you.\nGumshoe:\n...Uh-oh, I don't think I like the sound of this.\nBikini:\nDo you know that small girl? I believe she is Mystic Maya's little sister.\nEdgeworth:\n(Maya has a little sister...?)\nGumshoe:\nOh, you mean little Pearl! That's Maya Fey's cousin.\nEdgeworth:\nLittle... Pearl...?\nBikini:\nI thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after we'd finished with dinner cleanup... (Changed from [I thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after cleaning up dinner...] in the original release) But I haven't seen her at all since late last night! She's nowhere to be found!\nEdgeworth:\nY-You mean she...!? She was with the victim!?\nBikini:\nIt's all the fault of my stupid, creaky old back!\nEdgeworth:\n(A little girl who was with the victim on the night of the murder... is gone!)\nGumshoe:\nAs they say... \"The plot thickens!\"Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagatama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nTh-That's...! That's one of the Fey clan's very own Magatamas! That's a priceless treasure you've got there!\nGumshoe:\nW...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me!\nBikini:\nYes... You don't look it, but now I can see you're a real fan of the occult!\nEdgeworth:\nExcuse me?\nBikini:\nOh, of course this piece couldn't possibly be real, but to have such a nice replica... Clearly, you are a big fan of the Kurain Tradition!\nGumshoe:\nW...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me!\nEdgeworth:\n(I should have known better than to show this thing around...)\n\n\n\n\nHanging Scroll\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nHuh... Ahh! Well, well, well... Look what you've found! That's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, Mystic Misty Fey!\nEdgeworth:\n\"Fey\"...\nBikini:\nIt's been nearly 20 years since Mystic Misty's disappearance. Apparently, she intended to pass on the Master title to her daughter.\nEdgeworth:\nWho is this daughter?\nBikini:\nWell, I myself am part of a branch family of the Fey clan. But even I am not privy to information concerning the main family...\n\n\n\n\nIris's Hood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nWell, well, well! That's a Demon-Warding Hood! Acolytes are highly susceptible to possession by evil spirits, you know. That's why we always wear these for protection.\nEdgeworth:\nOh, I see...\nBikini:\nWhat are you waiting for? You won't get any protection just by holding it, you know! Put it on already!\nEdgeworth:\nNo! I can't...! I was just...!\nBikini:\n... Ha ha ha ho ho ho!\nGumshoe:\nHo ho ho! It's like it was made just for you, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean by that, Detective!?\nBikini:\nIt looks absolutely marvelous!

Cult!\" New Year's Issue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAbout this picture...\nBikini:\nWell look at that! I look pretty s-to-the-exy, don't you think!?\nGumshoe:\nUm, ah... Y-Yeah. Absolutely.\nBikini:\nUp until recently, we've avoided exposure in such magazines. But this time we had our reasons...\nEdgeworth:\nIs that so? For exampl--?\nBikini:\nHa ha ha ha ha!!! Well, why deny the world the sight of such a lovely face!?\n\n\n\n\nPhoto of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\n...Ohhhh! H-How could such a... terrible thing have happened...? It's all... It's all... It's all my fault!\nGumshoe:\nWell come on, lady... I don't think you need to take all the blame yourself.\nBikini:\nQuiet! What do you know anyway!?\nGumshoe:\n...Ouch. You're scary!\nBikini:\nWith that stupid 5 o'clock shadow and that stupid old coat of yours... It's too bad that you weren't the one that disappeared!\nGumshoe:\n... ...Why does she have to take it all out on me?\nEdgeworth:\n(Her anger does seem a little... manufactured.)\n\n\n\n\nNote to Iris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nDo you know anything about this old, crumpled-up letter?\nBikini:\n... Is that addressed to Iris?\nGumshoe:\nYup, it clearly says \"To Iris\" on it.\nBikini:\nI can't believe it... That girl doesn't have any secrets from me...\nEdgeworth:\n(Ah... So Sister Bikini didn't know anything about it...)\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix Wright profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nThis man... His face betrays a life of suffering and great weariness of the world.\nEdgeworth:\n...Um, sure.\nBikini:\nBut even so... I can't believe this guy actually jumped into the river! Think of all the fun things he might have enjoyed if he had just lived... Relentless spiritual training alone is no way to lead a complete life, huh...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n(It sounds like she's got some major regrets she's dealing with... Hmm... Perhaps I should let Gumshoe explain Wright's situation to her for me...)\nGumshoe:\nH-Hey! Don't look at me like that! Do you own dirty work! ...Sir!\n\n\n\n\nLarry Butz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nThis is Mystic Elise's apprentice, is it not? I think he might have a bit of a crush on me... Sweet boy at any rate.\nGumshoe:\nHuh?\nBikini:\nOh, I don't blame him. Sister Bikini understands the temptations of young men.\nEdgeworth:\n...Sure.\nBikini:\nBut I'm afraid it wouldn't be proper to abuse my position. I am head nun, after all. But, in return, I did allow him to draw a portrait of me.\nEdgeworth:\n(I pray it was a pose that maintained your modesty. For everyone's sake...)\n\n\n\n\nIris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou said you went with Maya to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple last night. Did you happen to see Iris while you were there?\nBikini:\nOf course I saw her. I told her to meet us after ringing the 10:00 bell for lights out.\nGumshoe:\nSo you're saying Iris came to the Inner Temple then?\nBikini:\nOf course she did. Iris has always been a good, obedient girl. After that, I had Maya begin her training ceremony.\nEdgeworth:\n(But that doesn't fit with Iris's story at all... She said that she never went to the Inner Temple!)\nGumshoe:\nAs they say... \"The plot thickens!\"\n\n\n\n\nBikini profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nIt's all my fault... Me and my stupid back! Mystic Elise has been murdered, an important acolyte is trapped... ...and a little girl has been lost!\nGumshoe:\nYou know you really shouldn't be so negative. It creates bad karma...\nBikini:\n...Quite right. I need to do some more training myself, I think...\n\n\n\n\nMaya Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nShe's a very important visitor, you know! An honored acolyte!\nEdgeworth:\n\"Honored\"? How so?\nBikini:\nThe Fey name is synonymous with the Kurain Channeling Technique. Therefore, she must be a spirit medium of great power indeed.\nGumshoe:\nNow that you mention it, one year ago... ...there was a case that was about the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique!\nEdgeworth:\n...Detective. I detest talk of supernatural drivel. I suppose now you'll say she has midi-chlorians?\nGumshoe:\nHo ho ho. So it gives you the creeps, huh, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n(...That's got nothing to do with it.)\n\n\n\n\nPearl Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nOh, this poor girl... Where could she have gone...?\nGumshoe:\nWell, we checked out her home and she's not there.\nBikini:\nAnd she's nowhere in the vicinity of the temple either...\nEdgeworth:\n(Which means... ...there's only a few other possibilities as to where she could be.)\nGumshoe:\nAh! Do you think maybe she fell off the bridge and was carried downstream...!?\nEdgeworth:\n... Why do you have to be such a pessimist, Detective!?\nGumshoe:\nNngh... I was just trying to think like you, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\n(Ironic. I became a pessimist only after I had the pleasure of working with you!)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nUmm, about this here...\nBikini:\nHmm... Let me see... Well, as you may know... In order to see reality for what it truly is... ...we strive to break our attachments to much of the transient, material realm. I guess you could call me an \"immaterial girl\"!\nGumshoe:\nI guess she lives in an immaterial world, huh Mr. Edgeworth?Main Gate (before clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nI'm just no good with people like her.

Don't you think you're expecting a little too much of me? I'm just a 25 year old jobless bum trying to be an apprentice artist!

Are you really gonna defend that nun, Iris, at the trial tomorrow?Edgeworth:\nYes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitment. (Changed from [Yes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitments.] in the original release)Gumshoe:\nWell, in that case... I've gotta be careful... Gotta make sure I don't leak the prosecution's whole investigation...Edgeworth:\nDon't worry about it, Detective. Just keep your mouth closed and I think most of it will flow out on its own.Gumshoe:\n... You got it, sir! I'll make sure it flows out like water from a tap! (Changed from [Roger, sir!

You're right! But I'm pretty sure the Main Hall didn't have a 2nd floor.\nEdgeworth:\nHazakura Temple was built on a steep part of the mountain. The front and back of the Main Hall are on different levels.\nGumshoe:\nOh... That makes sense...

Let's see if we can summarize what we've learned so far.\nGumshoe:\nOK! Let's take a look at the map. ...According to the testimony of Sister Bikini, the head nun... ...right after they'd finished dinner, she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple. (Changed from [...she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple right after dinner was finished.] in the original release) At 10 PM, after ringing the bell for lights out, Iris went to the Inner Temple. When she got there, Bikini had her take over while she went back to Hazakura Temple. After taking a hot bath to soothe her back... ...Sister Bikini witnessed the murder in the courtyard! If you want more details, you should ask Bikini herself in the Main Hall.\nEdgeworth:\n(The Inner Temple, huh...? I'd like some more information about that place...)\n\n\n\n\nTomorrow's trial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe trial begins tomorrow, but who's the prosecutor?\nGumshoe:\nI'm pretty sure it's that Godot guy, but... ...nobody can get a hold of him, so they're looking for a replacement.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean...?\nGumshoe:\nIt's really weird. All of a sudden, no one can reach him! Hmm, I wonder if the rumors are true. Maybe since Mr. Wright caught a cold and won't be defending, he just lost interest.\nEdgeworth:\nI intend to appear in court in the role of defense lawyer. However... I would be quite unhappy if it came out that I'm actually a prosecutor.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, I can see why. But I'm not the one you have to worry about... I think the real problem is gonna be that judge...\nEdgeworth:\n...Yes, he certainly would remember my face, even after such a long absence. That's why I requested another judge preside over the case. We've only met each other once. There's a good chance he won't remember me at all.\nGumshoe:\nY-Yeah, but... what about the prosecutor? Everyone in the prosecutor's office must know you! Wouldn't it be a problem if someone there made a big stink, sir?\nEdgeworth:\nThere's no need to worry. I pulled a few strings and arranged for a prosecutor of my own choosing.\nGumshoe:\nWow, Mr. Edgeworth... I had no idea you had such a powerful string to pull!\n\n\n\n\nInner Temple (appears after \"What happened\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this Inner Temple that Maya was supposedly training at...?\nGumshoe:\nAccording to Bikini, it's an old building they use for training the acolytes. It's on the other side of Dusky Bridge.\nEdgeworth:\n(The bridge that burned down, huh...) Is there anything else on the other side of that bridge besides the Inner Temple?\nGumshoe:\nNope, not a thing.\nEdgeworth:\nNothing?\nGumshoe:\nThe other side is surrounded by cliffs on all sides... In a way, it's kinda like a little island out there.\nEdgeworth:\n(So the only thing there is the Inner Temple...)\nGumshoe:\nI hear it's not the kind of place a person could survive in.\nEdgeworth:\n(Please be alright, Maya...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictim's Staff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nOh, so I think I might have already told you about this, but... The truth is... When I was a little kid...\nEdgeworth:\nYou wanted to become a wizard, right?\nGumshoe:\nHey, that's amazing! How did you know that!? So? What do you think? I'd make a really great one, don't you think?\nEdgeworth:\nWe just had this conversation a little while ago, Detective!\n\n\n\n\nShichishito\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThis sword represents the multiple branches that life can take, all ending as one.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... I've never heard that one.\nGumshoe:\nYou know what I think about sometimes? What kind of life would I have had if I hadn't joined the Homicide Division.\nEdgeworth:\n...So you think about that kind of thing too, huh?\nGumshoe:\nOf course I do. I think about it a lot. Me as a traffic cop. Me as a detention officer. Me as the Blue Badger...\nEdgeworth:\n(...I guess he doesn't have any plans to leave the force.)\n\n\n\n\nBikini profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThis is the witness who saw the crime take place out there in the temple courtyard. I'm pretty sure it's gonna be her testimony that'll be key to this case, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nSo you mean she's going to be a witness in the trial tomorrow...?\nGumshoe:\nOf course! A nun is as trustworthy as you can get! We got this one in the bag! ... Oh. I-I mean, I've always been on your side, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! So yeah, this is a pretty tight spot we've gotten ourselves into, huh!?\nEdgeworth:\n(Now I understand why Wright is always breaking into a cold sweat...)\n\n\n\n\nMaya Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI wonder if Maya is alright? I could never show my face to Wright again if something were to happen to her.\nGumshoe:\nAww, it'll be OK. If that ever happens, you can just show him my face. How's that...?\nEdgeworth:\n...\nGumshoe:\nAck! Um, I didn't mean it like that, sir! It was just a silly little joke!\nEdgeworth:\nI wonder if there is another way to get across to the other side? The support wires for the bridge are still intact, correct?\nGumshoe:\nThat bridge is almost 20 yards long... I know I may look like it, Mr. Edgeworth, but I'm no super hero.\nEdgeworth:\n(In any case, I just hope Maya is alright...)\n\n\n\n\nPearl Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat about Pearl...? Has no one seen her at all since last night?\nGumshoe:\nSeems that way... Apparently, she hasn't gone back to Kurain Village either, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nBut it's true that she was with Elise Deauxnim at some point last night?\nGumshoe:\nNo doubt about it. Ah...! Y-You mean that maybe whoever killed Ms. Deauxnim also...!?\nEdgeworth:\nD-Don't jump to any crazy conclusions!\nGumshoe:\nOooooouuuch! ...You sure have one mean punch, Mr. Edgeworth! It's down-right fierce!After clearing all Talk options in Dusky Bridge, clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate, clearing all Talk options and examining left corner near altar in Hazakura Temple - Main Hall, and clearing all Talk options and examining staff and Ami Fey statue in Hazakura Temple - Courtyard:February 8Detention CenterVisitor's RoomIris:\nAh...

Where is it on this map...?\nIris:\n...It's around here. To get there, you must follow a small path down from Dusky Bridge... The reality is, to get to the Inner Temple, I had no choice but to cross that bridge. But the thought that such a terrible criminal could be lurking at Heavenly Hall... I...

She said that when Maya Fey began her training at the Inner Temple... ...you were there as well.\nIris:\nWhat...!?\nEdgeworth:\nWhen I spoke with you last, you claimed that you never went to the Inner Temple. And yet, Sister Bikini says she met with you at the Inner Temple that very night.\nIris:\nB-But I... I didn't go there! I didn't go to the Inner Temple last night.\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm...

That's why I'm committed to searching until I have those answers. Now then, is it really true that you didn't go to the Inner Temple last night...?\nIris:\nY-Yes, I swear... I already told you that.\nEdgeworth:\n...Yes. You said you didn't go because you were frightened.\nIris:\n...Th-That's right.\nEdgeworth:\nIf that's the case... ...then the obvious question is, \"What were you so afraid of?\"\nIris:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nIris...

(Changed from [I even chased one of them to Tibet... Next it's going to be prison, I guess.] in the original release) ...I'll steal that detective's wallet. That'll get me locked up for sure. ...Nah. I can't do that to someone who looks like he's down on his luck.Gumshoe:\n...He's just talking to himself.Edgeworth:\nShh! Be quiet and listen!Butz:\nI knew it... I shouldn't have done that! I blew it again...Edgeworth:\n(\"Done that\"? What did he do, I wonder...)Gumshoe:\nHey! You! About what you just said... I got an objection!Butz:\nWh-Wh-Wh-What the...!? Ed-Edgey! You dirty rat!Edgeworth:\n*glare* (Gumshoe... You oaf...!)Gumshoe:\nI-I'm sorry, sir! Before I knew it, I was shouting out, \"Objection!\". And in a loud, commanding voice, too! I even pointed with my pointer finger!Edgeworth:\n...You've watched too many trials.Gumshoe:\nI'm sorry!Edgeworth:\nOK, Larry, the jig is up. What have you got to say for yourself?Butz:\nUngh...Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEagle River\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThis is the Eagle River, sir. It runs pretty fast, so it doesn't ice over, even in the winter.\nEdgeworth:\nIf it had iced over, Wright would have been in some serious trouble.\nGumshoe:\nYou're right about that! He would've landed on the ice, and slid downstream to who knows where.\nEdgeworth:\n(...Not exactly what I meant, but alright...)\n\n\n\n\nDusky Bridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt's a little far, but I have a pretty clear view of Dusky Bridge from here.\nButz:\nAhh. I still can't believe it! ...Really.\nEdgeworth:\n...? What is it, Larry?\nButz:\nHuh! Err, uhh, nothing. It's nothing!\nGumshoe:\nSounds pretty suspicious to me!\nEdgeworth:\n(Something about that statement smells... And you know what they say...)\n\n\n\n\nStairway\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThese go all the way to Dusky Bridge. It's a pretty long, but easy, walk.\nGumshoe:\nI fell down 4 times on my way down here, sir!\nButz:\nOh, sorry about that, Detective. I ate four bananas and tossed their peels on the stairs on my way down here...\nGumshoe:\n... What!? So that's what I was slipping on!\nButz:\nBe careful on the way back. Those deadly banana peels are still out there.\nGumshoe:\nHmm... That's a real important piece of information right there, Mr. Edgeworth!\n\n\n\n\nString of flags\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this festive-looking ornament?\nButz:\nIt reminds me of art class in grade school. We used to have a lot of fun decorating the classroom with origami. Remember?\nEdgeworth:\nW-Well, I...\nButz:\nOh, yeah... You were never any good at it.\nGumshoe:\nReally?\nButz:\nYeah, this guy was so bad, he couldn't even fold a dollar, let alone a crane. Everyone tried to comfort him, but he would just sit there sobbing.\nGumshoe:\nReally? I never would have expected that.\nEdgeworth:\nBe quiet already! I'll never forget the shame of that day! You want a crane! I can now make a perfect quarter-inch crane without a single flaw!\nButz:\n... You know, Edgey... Nothing for nothing, but a quarter-inch crane without a single flaw is not easy.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's quite a feat, Prosecutor Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\n(Grr... This is exactly why I hate childhood friends...)\n\n\n\n\nShack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThat's a horrible graffiti problem you've got there, pal.\nButz:\nYou don't know anything, Detective. This is art! It's an expression of my bittersweet love for Iris.\nEdgeworth:\nLarry. Do you know what the difference between graffiti and true art is?\nButz:\n... It's how the artist himself defines it, right?\nEdgeworth:\n... (I should've seen that one coming.)\nGumshoe:\nWell, if that's the case, then all of my lunchboxes are masterpieces too, pal!\n\n\n\n\nRoof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe straw roof is totally covered with freshly fallen powdery snow.\nGumshoe:\nWow, makes a nice image, doesn't it? I always did like the rustic look.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Heavenly Hall\"... I suppose it's an appropriate name in some sense.\nButz:\nYou got that right. Look at that bridge up there. This place has to be heaven, because that thing is hell.\nEdgeworth:\n... You would do well to remember, Larry... ...that this is a sacred place to some people.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeavenly Hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this little shack anyway?\nButz:\nWell, I just discovered it myself yesterday.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd why were you down here in the first place?\nButz:\nErr, come on... I'm an artist... I was looking for a good place to sketch. This is a great little place! It's err... artistic. It's quiet, it's cold, it's got no power, and it looks like it's about to collapse.\nGumshoe:\n...Sounds a lot like my apartment there, pal.\nEdgeworth:\n(One thing's for sure... No one is likely to show up and disturb you here...)\nButz:\nSo can I get you something to drink? Some hot water, maybe?\nGumshoe:\n...He's getting all buddy-buddy on us, sir.\n\n\n\n\nIris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\n...Listen to me, Edgey. You've gotta do this... You've gotta save Iris!\nEdgeworth:\nWhy are you so sure she's innocent? Because she's cute?\nButz:\nWatch your mouth! Anyway, I've made up my mind about it! I'm going to marry that girl!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nGumshoe:\nUmm... Mr. Edgeworth is pretending he didn't hear you, so I'm gonna ask for him. Have you already asked this girl to marry you?\nButz:\nNo, no. Not yet. But I can tell how she feels by the look in her eyes! She's got this \"I really want this man to carry me over the threshold\" look! I'm sure Nick would be surprised! He'd never imagine that I could marry such a beautiful girl like that!\nEdgeworth:\nSomething tells me he would be shocked, indeed.\nButz:\nThat's why I didn't want her to do anything dangerous. I mean, what am I gonna do if she gets hurt?\nGumshoe:\n... What is this guy trying to say? He lost me about a mile back...\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... If we really want to know the answer to that... (...we're going to have to drag him onto the witness stand.)\n\n\n\n\nThe night of the crime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nCome to think of it, you still haven't answered my question. Where were you and what were you doing last night?\nButz:\nAww, man... Don't you have anything else to talk about? With that kind of attitude, you'll never be a ladies' man like me...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nButz:\nO-OK, OK! Chill out with those scary eyes! I got it! If you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Something incredible\"?\n\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n\nButz:\n...Yeah, yeah. But let's not talk about that now. Let's talk about the good old days. What do you say? Come on, I'll pour you a nice cup of hot water.\nEdgeworth:\n(Why hasn't he realized... ...that I absolutely despise talking about the \"good old days\", especially with him?)\n\n\n\n\nThe night of the crime (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat exactly did you see last night?\nButz:\nWell... It's kinda hard to say...\n\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n\nButz:\nIt's one of those things... Ya know what I mean...? It's like... It's not so much \"what\" I saw, as it's the situation in general... You see what I'm getting at? Whew, that's a relief. Thanks, buddy. Ha ha ha ha ha.\nEdgeworth:\n(I have the strangest urge to smash this guy against those big, nasty locks...)\n\n\n\n\nThe night of the crime (after breaking Psyche-Locks)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo you were here in Heavenly Hall last night, were you not, Larry? And you saw the lightning hit Dusky Bridge, didn't you?\nButz:\nS-Sorry, Edgey...\nGumshoe:\nSorry doesn't cut it, you scumbag! Threatening a young lady like that...\nButz:\n*gulp*... ... Wait, hold up.\nGumshoe:\n...What now, pal?\nButz:\nWhat are you talking about!? What \"threatening\" stuff!?\nGumshoe:\nI'll tell you what! You tried to scare Iris by threatening to expose her secret, pal!\nButz:\nWhat do you mean threaten!? When did I threaten her!?\nGumshoe:\n\"...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed...\" That sure sounds like a threat to me, pal! Blackmail, in fact!\nButz:\nGimme a break! It's a love letter! Haven't you ever been in love!?\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What did you just say!?\nButz:\nMy love for her burns so hotly, it could melt all the snow on this mountain!\nEdgeworth:\nO-Oh? Then what is this secret you mention!?\nButz:\nCome on, Edgey... Don't you get it? I'm talking about the secret love between her and me! Obviously she wouldn't want old lady Bikini to know about it, right...? About our... hot and sour... bittersweet love affair!\nEdgeworth:\n... Alright, then why did you send a love letter in a business-like manila envelope!?\nButz:\nGive me a break! It's not my fault I didn't have any other envelopes! Yeesh!\nGumshoe:\nThen why were you so quick to apologize, pal!?\nButz:\nIt's cuz Edgey gave me that scary look of his!\nEdgeworth:\n... ...\nButz:\nWhat's wrong, Edgey? Why are you so quiet all of a sudden?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's it? THAT'S what all those huge locks were about? (Changed from [That's it? That's all [sic] those huge locks were about?] in the original release) I-I don't understand why you were so defensive...\nButz:\nWell, I dunno either... I guess the thing is... ...you shouldn't expect too much from a guy like me. ...Hey, come on. Don't let it get you down!\nGumshoe:\n... B-But Mr. Edgeworth! This guy is still hiding something! I know it!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nDon't forget what this guy said just a minute ago!\n\n\nButz:\nIf you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible.\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm... He's right!) Larry!\nButz:\nWh-What!? Y-You're looking at me like a hungry dog that just found a bone!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat was this \"something incredible\" you saw last night...? ...You're going to tell me, Larry! One way or another!\n\n\n\n\nSomething incredible (appears after \"The night of the crime\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"I... I already told you, didn't I?\"Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagatama (after clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\n\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n-- The Night of the Crime --\nEdgeworth:\nAlright, now you're going to tell me what you really saw last night...\nButz:\nWhoa. You're really upset, aren't you, Edgey? OK, I'll talk!\nEdgeworth:\n...Huh? (That was a bit too easy...)\nButz:\nYeah, anyway! It was awesome! Never seen anything like it! At around 10 o'clock last night, it started thundering. I'd been sleeping... I'm not sure for how long. Suddenly... ZING! The world in front of me went white! Like I'd just been slapped in the face by my old girlfriend, Naomi!\nEdgeworth:\n...And then?\nButz:\nAnd then... It was on fire! The bridge was on fire!\nEdgeworth:\nDusky Bridge caught on fire!? Are you saying you saw it with your own eyes?\nButz:\nHey! Why are you giving me the evil eye!? I'm telling the truth!\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm... There are still three Psycholocks remaining... (Changed from [Hmm... There are still 3 Psycholocks remaining...] in the original release) That means he's still trying to hide something...) By the way, Larry... Where were you when you saw that happen?\nButz:\nWh-Wh-Wh-Where you say? Wh-Wh-What do you mean!?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean, \"What do I mean\"!? ...Just answer the question!\nButz:\nI-I was in my own room... by the Main Hall! Where else would I be!?\nEdgeworth:\nAs usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar. The problem, I suspect, lies there...\nButz:\nTh-Th-Th-Th-There? Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Whaddya mean th-th-there?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's impossible for you to have seen lightning strike Dusky Bridge from your room!\n\n\n\nPresent Hazakura Temple Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This is a map of the area.

Try drinking your hot water. If you don't drink it fast it's going to get cold.\nEdgeworth:\nOh, sorry... (It's cold alright... The water... And my evidence.)\nButz:\nWell? Have you calmed down yet?\nEdgeworth:\nUm, yes... I'm going to think it over again.\nButz:\nH-Hey, I'm telling you... there's nothing to think over! I was in my room doing \"she loves me, she loves me not\" with a bunch of flowers.\nLeads back to:\n\"As usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar.\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis is a map of the area. Take a look around the vicinity of Hazakura Temple.\nButz:\nWh-What am I looking for?\nEdgeworth:\nI think that should be fairly obvious. The Main Hall is surrounded by trees and it's impossible to see the bridge from here.\nButz:\nWhat...!? Why didn't you tell me that before!?\n\n1 LOCK BROKEN\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Well? How about it?\nButz:\nHow about what?\nEdgeworth:\nDo you feel like talking now?\nButz:\nAbout what?\nEdgeworth:\n... (It looks like it won't be that easy after all...) ...You leave me no choice. I'll have to move on to the next step. You weren't in your room at the temple. So then... Where were you?\nButz:\nY-Y-You don't know that I wasn't in my room!\nEdgeworth:\n(So where was Larry, and why was he there...? If I've read the situation up to this point correctly, the answer is fairly obvious.) ...Very well then. Let's test my theory. The place you witnessed lightning striking Dusky Bridge from was... here!\n\n\n\nPresent Heavenly Hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall!\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis is where you were! Well, what do you think, Larry!?\nButz:\nOh... Not much I guess.\nEdgeworth:\n... I'm sorry, but what kind of answer is that?\nButz:\nWell, you were just making small talk, right? Like \"How are you doing?\" or something.\nEdgeworth:\n...Larry. Look at the expression on my face. Do I look like I was just making small talk?\nButz:\nTo be honest? No... I guess not. Ha ha ha ha ha...\nEdgeworth:\n(It appears I didn't think it through carefully enough.)\nLeads back to:\n\"So where was Larry, and why was he there...?\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall!\nButz:\n...Wh-Why would I be hanging out in this old shack? It's freezing cold, there's no electricity, and it could fall apart at any minute...\nEdgeworth:\nLarry... How do you know that anyway? How do you know there's no electricity? After all, it's not that dark yet.\nButz:\nAh... Uh-oh!\nEdgeworth:\nIn other words, you have just provided evidence to prove my theory... My theory that you've at least once in your life visited Heavenly Hall after sunset!\n\n1 LOCK BROKEN\n\nButz:\nI have to admit I'm impressed, Edgey! You're in a totally different league from Nick.\nEdgeworth:\n...That's nice. Now tell me. What were you doing at this cold little shack last night?\nButz:\nThat's what you might call... A \"Fair de Core\".\nEdgeworth:\nI think you mean \"affaire de coeur\". Could it be you were... waiting for someone?\nButz:\nOoooh nooo! Y-You really are one scary guy, you know...\nEdgeworth:\nI believe that last night, you were waiting for this person to come meet you!\n\n\n\nPresent Iris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n \nEdgeworth:\n...Well, Larry!? Was it THIS person...?\nButz:\n...You know what? You should save your finger pointing for the courtroom.\nEdgeworth:\nTsk...!\nButz:\nIt's no wonder people call you a workaholic. You work too hard! You should be like me!\nEdgeworth:\n(Well, I'd rather \"work too hard\" than \"hardly work\" like a loafaholic like you...) In any case... I know you were waiting for someone!\nButz:\nYeah, but... It's like I said. It's an \"affaire de guerre\".\nEdgeworth:\nNo, Larry. You mean \"affaire de coeur\". At least I think you do.\nLeads back to:\n\"Could it be you were... waiting for someone?\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry.\nButz:\nI told you before... Don't call me \"Larry\"...\nEdgeworth:\nThe person you were waiting for was... Iris!\nButz:\nOhh... Suddenly I feel cold all over, Edgey.\nEdgeworth:\nNo doubt because of my chilly glare.\nButz:\nSo you think I got the hots for Sister Iris, huh...? D-Do you have some kind of evidence!? You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing?\nEdgeworth:\n(This is where I draw the line and end this ridiculous little game...)

I-Is it just me?\nEdgeworth:\nNow, I'm the one that suddenly feels cold...\nButz:\nMaybe it's because of my cold laugh?\nEdgeworth:\n(Grr... I hate making such stupid mistakes...)\nButz:\nDo you really have the evidence you say you do, Edgey?\nLeads back to:\n\"You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing?\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Here's your evidence. You called her to this spot with a pathetic blackmail letter!\nButz:\nOh! H-Hey! G-G-Give that back! You're embarrassing me! What are you doing with that anyway!?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's not important! ...I misjudged you, Larry.\nButz:\nWhat do you mean...?\nEdgeworth:\nTaking advantage of a woman's frailty like that! You should be ashamed of yourself!\nButz:\nOhhh... OHHHH!\nEdgeworth:\nFirst of all, what's this at the top of the letter? It says, \"Salutation here\"!\nButz:\nW-Well that's what it said in that book, \"Letter Writing for Dummies\"!\nEdgeworth:\nYou're not supposed to actually write that!

People acting bizarrely in my court! Uwa-hah!von Karma:\n...The stage is set. Now continue with the proceedings, Your Honor.Judge:\nVery well. Ms. von Karma, please give an outline of this case. With as little whipping as possible!von Karma:\nThe murder victim is the famed picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Her body was found in the Hazakura Temple courtyard. She had been stabbed through the torso by a ceremonial sword from a golden statue.Judge:\nThe sword in this picture... is the weapon in question, correct...? ...Very well. The court accepts this photo of the crime scene.Crime Photo added to the Court Record.von Karma:\nThere is no mistake. This was the doing of Sister Iris. After all... there is a witness to her crime.Judge:\n...Very well. Please bring this witness to the stand!Edgeworth:\n(And so it begins... My first and my last trial... as a defense attorney!)von Karma:\n...Witness. State your name and occupation. Please.Judge:\nH-Hold on here! I'm not sure about being not sure if I care for this at all! Witness! Please stand up nice and straight!Edgeworth:\nIf I recall correctly... ...there are a few milk crates in the Defendant's Lobby for our back pain-plagued witness. (Changed from [...there are a few milk crates in the defendant's lobby for witnesses with bad backs.] in the original release)Judge:\nBailiff! Fetch a crate for this poor lady, please!von Karma:\n...Once again. Your name and occupation, please.Bikini:\nLittle old me? Well, I'm the head nun of Hazakura Temple on Eagle Mountain. My name is Bikini. You got it? Bikini. Nice to meet everyone.Judge:\n... But you don't appear to be wearing a bikini right now... Uwah!von Karma:\n...The courtroom is the garden of holy judgment. Those with lechery in their hearts should leave this sanctuary at once!Judge:\nY-You want me to leave!?Bikini:\nNo need to get your bikinis in a twist! Let me tell you, I'm a sight to behold in summer! Wha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha!Edgeworth:\nIn any case... Witness. I hear that you saw the crime take place on the night in question.Bikini:\nThat's right! I can still hardly believe it myself, to be honest. There's no way dear little Iris could do anything like that...Judge:\nLet us hear what you have to say then. First, tell us aboot your own movements that night, eh!Witness Testimony-- The Night of the Murder --Bikini:\nThat night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But...\nWell, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently.\nSo, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.\nThere's no bath at the Inner Temple, you see, and I needed a long, hot soak.\nIt was after I had finished, just as I was heading back... that's when I saw it!Judge:\nHmm... So it was simply coincidence that you found yourself returning to Hazakura Temple?Bikini:\n...Yes, you could say that. If my back hadn't been in so much pain, I would have stayed at the Inner Temple.Edgeworth:\n(That sounds like a pretty important statement she just made...)von Karma:\nThere is only one problem with this testimony that I can see... And you're not about to fall at the first hurdle, now are you, Miles Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth. ...Please begin your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- The Night of the Murder --Bikini:\nThat night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this Inner Temple...?\nBikini:\nWell, see, conversing with the spirits is what we train people to do, right?\nJudge:\nWe'll be the ones asking you the questions, madam.\nBikini:\n...In order to do that, a place strong in spiritual power is required. There's a small temple across Dusky Bridge, called the Inner Temple.  Acolytes must spend an entire night there to undergo intense training.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd how exactly do you help with this process...?\nBikini:\nIt is all quite exacting. It can't be performed without a nun supervising.\nvon Karma:\nLike a tutor, watching to make sure a spoiled child studies.\nEdgeworth:\n(A tutor with a whip, in your case.) If that is the case... ...then why did you return to Hazakura Temple, where the murder took place?Bikini:\nWell, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nViolently...?\nBikini:\nThat's right. It's no laughing matter, especially in winter! I can't hold anything heavier than a knife and fork during the cold months! Just being alive is like strict training! Wah ha ha! Wha ha! Wah ha ha!\nEdgeworth:\nOn the night of the murder, was this fabulous back of yours hurting again...?\nBikini:\nThat's right. Raging like a bull in a pigpen. I almost fainted once or twice! I just knew that unless I warmed it up, it was going to finally finish me off!Bikini:\nSo, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou \"left Iris to help\"... With what?\nBikini:\nWhat do you think? The acolyte's training, of course. It was just past 10 PM, so we were starting to enter into the training exercises proper.\nJudge:\nWasn't it your place to remain with the disciple?\nBikini:\nWell, the job is simply to watch over the acolyte so that they don't pass away.\nEdgeworth:\nJust to confirm this point again, that night... ...you met Iris in the Inner Temple, correct?\nBikini:\nYes, yes. She's a gentle, honest girl. She's never once failed to follow my directions.Present Iris's Testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Witnesses have to undergo their own trials, I'm afraid. The defendant's fate rests on their powers of observation and memory, after all.\nBikini:\nWell, well, well. Don't worry! I'm more than up to the task! I'm a woman of faith, after all. The head honcho of Hazakura Temple.\nEdgeworth:\nIn that case, Ms. Honcho... I'd like you to explain something for me. The discrepancy between your testimony and that of the defendant, Iris. She claims that after ringing the lights out bell, she went back and stayed in her room. ...Which means! She did not go to the Inner Temple at all!\nBikini:\nN... No...! She said that...?\nvon Karma:\n\nvon Karma:\nA defendant or a witness... Who is more likely to lie, do you suppose? The defendant is simply lying to cover her back!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nBut that is completely illogical. The murder was committed in the courtyard of Hazakura Temple. Claiming that she \"went to the Inner Temple\" would make for a much better alibi.\nvon Karma:\n...!\nBikini:\nBut that is odd... Whatever the reason... I can't believe that she would lie...!\nJudge:\nHmm... she does indeed have honest eyes! Uwaaaah!\nvon Karma:\n...All people lie. That is my belief.\nJudge:\nWhy am I the only one being whipped in here...!? Anyway! Neither the witness nor the defendant have any reason to lie! Which means... We must call your memory into question...\nBikini:\nDear, dear, dear. You're older than me and yet you want to play that game, do you?\nJudge:\nA-Ah, well, that isn't exactly what I...\nBikini:\nMy memory is perfect! Crystal clear! Especially in winter!\nJudge:\nThen... I suppose it's too early to end this cross-examination, eh. Mr. Edgeworth. If you are going to question the memory of this witness... ...you will need to show me a more decisive piece of evidence.\nEdgeworth:\n...Understood, Your Honor. (I was naïve to think that alone would do the trick.)\nJudge:\nThen please add your comments aboot Iris to the testimony... And let us return to the cross-examination.\nChanges statement from \"So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.\" to \"Iris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner.\"Bikini:\nIris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nAre you sure that you're not making a mistake...?\nBikini:\n...You, young man, need to get your estimation of me up from the floor!\nEdgeworth:\nNngh...!\nBikini:\nIris always wears the same clothes. The smallest thing out of place would have stood out like a sore thumb to me! You're making a mistake, thinking I made a mistake!\nJudge:\n...An excellent finish there, witness.\nEdgeworth:\n(Still, I have to wonder...)Present Iris's Hood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...Witness. Let's get one thing straight.\"Bikini:\nThere's no bath at the Inner Temple, you see, and I needed a long, hot soak.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...So you returned to the Hazakura Temple in order to take a bath?\nBikini:\nMy back is to blame for everything. It's a \"do or be done in\" kind of world, after all.\nEdgeworth:\nHow long were you in the bath for, if you don't mind me asking?\nBikini:\n... My my my, what a filthy little rogue you are! I know what's on your mind!\nEdgeworth:\n...?\nBikini:\nI bet your next question is going to be, \"Where exactly did you wash?\" Ah, THIS is why you have to watch the young ones...\nEdgeworth:\nW-What are you going on about!? I was... Gwah!\nvon Karma:\n...Pathetic, Miles Edgeworth.\nJudge:\nThe lowest of the low.\nEdgeworth:\n(Is there some sort of \"Kick Me\" sign stuck to the defense's bench!?)\nBikini:\nAnyway, I couldn't afford to be away from my post for too long, you understand, so...Bikini:\nIt was after I had finished, just as I was heading back... that's when I saw it!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe crime took place in the courtyard, correct...?\nBikini:\nWhen you go from my room to the Main Hall... ...you have to take a winding hallway from which you can see the courtyard.\nvon Karma:\nThat's right. In other words... ...it was pure coincidence that the witness saw the crime taking place before her eyes. There was no complicated set-up in this case!\nJudge:\nHmm... That certainly seems to be true.Edgeworth:\n(There is indeed only one problem with this testimony. If I can clearly point out what it is, then I can begin to quantify... ...just how good this witness's memory and observation skills are.)Edgeworth:\n...Witness. Let's get one thing straight. The defendant whom you claim to have met... ...she was wearing this \"Demon-Warding Hood\", correct?Bikini:\nOf course! That is a very important piece of clothing, I'll have you know! Wha ha ha! Wha ha ha! Ha ha... Wait a minute...von Karma:von Karma:\nH-Hold it right there! Why do you have that...!?Edgeworth:\nThat's the question of the day, now isn't it... Ms. von Karma? I'll have you know that this hood was given to someone as a gift that night. Before the lights out bell was rung.von Karma:\nW... What!?Edgeworth:\n...You know where I'm going with this, don't you? If the witness had seen the defendant as she claims... ...then the Iris she saw should have been missing this very hood! (Changed from [...the defendant couldn't have been wearing this very hood!] in the original release)Bikini:\nWell well well!Edgeworth:\n(It's not a bad feeling at all, exposing contradictions like this... Now I understand that happy look on Wright's face every time he does it...)Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Witness, your response... Wuahaaa!von Karma:\n...Sister. This hood... You have spare ones around the temple, don't you?Bikini:\nSpares... Well... I do tend to make too many of them.Judge:\nI see... A stockpile. A surplus of hoods, eh?Bikini:\nEach nun is only given one hood. This should be the only hood that Iris owned...Judge:\nHmm... Then this is quite strange! Waaaah!von Karma:\nIf there was a surplus of hoods, then she could have worn one of those! ...There is no contradiction here!Judge:\nHmm...Edgeworth:\n(I'm sorry to break this to you, Ms. von Karma... but you won't get away that easily. Discrepancies such as this will sow seeds in any human heart. The seeds of doubt.)Judge:\n...Witness. While I don't wish to call your testimony into doubt... ...you must give every detail with precision.Bikini:\nI-I'm not sure I'm comfortable going along with this...von Karma:\nSister. You shall continue with your testimony. Tell us what you saw after finishing your bath, on your way back to the Inner Temple!Edgeworth:\n(Those seeds of doubt are sprouting in the judge's heart. They just need a little more stimulation to bear fruit... Contradictory stimulation.)Witness Testimony-- After My Bath --Bikini:\nI finished my bath around 11, and I thought I should return to the Inner Temple.\nAnd as I was walking back... I heard a noise from the courtyard. I took a look and...\nIris was...! Oh, Mystic Elise! And with that sword, of all things!\nMystic Elise was staying in the corner room, which faces out onto the courtyard.\nThe stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window.Judge:\nYou saw a truly terrible sight, didn't you...? If I was in your place... ...then it would be much like Ms. von Karma whipping Mr. Edgeworth in two in court! And me, seeing it all from this very chair! ...Er, well, something like that.Edgeworth:\n(This judge... His imagination is about as vivid and creative as Detective Gumshoe...)von Karma:\nI would look the fool if I commented on such foolishness. Anyway, this case is mine... Miles Edgeworth!Edgeworth:\nCalling everyone by their full name... Can't you do something about that habit of yours?Cross Examination",

Wha ha ha! Ha ha... Wait a minute...von Karma:von Karma:\nH-Hold it right there! Why do you have that...!?Edgeworth:\nThat's the question of the day, now isn't it... Ms. von Karma? I'll have you know that this hood was given to someone as a gift that night. Before the lights out bell was rung.von Karma:\nW... What!?Edgeworth:\n...You know where I'm going with this, don't you? If the witness had seen the defendant as she claims... ...then the Iris she saw should have been missing this very hood! (Changed from [...the defendant couldn't have been wearing this very hood!] in the original release)Bikini:\nWell well well!Edgeworth:\n(It's not a bad feeling at all, exposing contradictions like this... Now I understand that happy look on Wright's face every time he does it...)Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Witness, your response... Wuahaaa!von Karma:\n...Sister. This hood... You have spare ones around the temple, don't you?Bikini:\nSpares... Well... I do tend to make too many of them.Judge:\nI see... A stockpile. A surplus of hoods, eh?Bikini:\nEach nun is only given one hood. This should be the only hood that Iris owned...Judge:\nHmm... Then this is quite strange! Waaaah!von Karma:\nIf there was a surplus of hoods, then she could have worn one of those! ...There is no contradiction here!Judge:\nHmm...Edgeworth:\n(I'm sorry to break this to you, Ms. von Karma... but you won't get away that easily. Discrepancies such as this will sow seeds in any human heart. The seeds of doubt.)Judge:\n...Witness. While I don't wish to call your testimony into doubt... ...you must give every detail with precision.Bikini:\nI-I'm not sure I'm comfortable going along with this...von Karma:\nSister. You shall continue with your testimony. Tell us what you saw after finishing your bath, on your way back to the Inner Temple!Edgeworth:\n(Those seeds of doubt are sprouting in the judge's heart. They just need a little more stimulation to bear fruit... Contradictory stimulation.)Witness Testimony-- After My Bath --Bikini:\nI finished my bath around 11, and I thought I should return to the Inner Temple.\nAnd as I was walking back... I heard a noise from the courtyard. I took a look and...\nIris was...! Oh, Mystic Elise! And with that sword, of all things!\nMystic Elise was staying in the corner room, which faces out onto the courtyard.\nThe stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window.Judge:\nYou saw a truly terrible sight, didn't you...? If I was in your place... ...then it would be much like Ms. von Karma whipping Mr. Edgeworth in two in court! And me, seeing it all from this very chair! ...Er, well, something like that.Edgeworth:\n(This judge... His imagination is about as vivid and creative as Detective Gumshoe...)von Karma:\nI would look the fool if I commented on such foolishness. Anyway, this case is mine... Miles Edgeworth!Edgeworth:\nCalling everyone by their full name... Can't you do something about that habit of yours?Cross Examination",

Law OfficesMaya:\nHey, Nick.Phoenix:\nYeah? What is it?Maya:\nYou know how I've got spiritual powers, unlike you?Phoenix:\nUm, sure... You are a spirit medium, after all.Maya:\nBut just like you, if I don't keep my powers sharp, they get dull, right?Phoenix:\nUm... I guess so, yeah.Maya:\nGlad you agree! OK, Pearly! You're up!Phoenix:\n(Pearls...?)Pearl:\nSo! That's why we need to go on a special \"Spiritual Hot Spot Tour\", Mr. Nick!Phoenix:\n...Huh? I'm lost. What's this magazine you're shoving in my face?Pearl:\nIt's the New Year's issue of \"Oh! Cult!\", Winter Spiritual Locations Special!Phoenix:\n...Oh. (Pearls looks so happy.)Maya:\n\"Maximize your spiritual powers with just one night of intensive training!\" ...Oh! It sounds too good to be true!Phoenix:\nI'll say. It sounds more like a scam to me.Maya:\nIt's at a spiritual retreat called \"Hazakura Temple\". It's way up in the mountains, and I bet it's nice and cold. ...Just perfect for training!Phoenix:\n(Now I definitely don't want to go...)Maya:\nYou know, I think I've heard of this temple before. It's a famous channeling dojo. It's hard for even real spirit mediums like us to make reservations up there!Phoenix:\nReservations...? For a temple? Are you serious?Pearl:\nDon't worry! I've already made special reservations, just for us!Maya:\nYeah! And I signed up for the \"Special Course\"!Phoenix:\nTh-That's nice. And the timing couldn't be better. ...Since we don't have a case right now anyway.Maya:\nAlrighty then! It's settled! Well, come on! Don't just stand there! Start packing your stuff!Pearl:\nYes, Mr. Nick! You'd better start packing your stuff!Phoenix:\nHuh...? M-ME!? Why do I have to go!?Maya:\nWell, we have to be accompanied by someone over 20 years old.Phoenix:\nHey! I don't have anything to do with spirit power. The only thing I can channel is a TV. ... So, um, is there a heated pool at this \"Hazakura Temple\"?Pearl:\nNo, but you can stand under a freezing waterfall!Phoenix:\n... Sorry, but I think I'll pass. I hate cold places.Maya:\nWhaaat!? No way! How can you be so selfish!?Pearl:\nCome on, Mr. Nick! Look at this place! Doesn't it look beautiful!?Phoenix:\nNope. Not going. I'm gonna be nice and toasty at home....... .................What the...!?Pearl:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Nick?Phoenix:\nLet me see that magazine! Th-This nun...Maya:\nIs she a friend of yours or something, Nick?Phoenix:\n(Th-This girl... I-It's...!)Dahlia:\nMy name is Dahlia Hawthorne. I just want to say... It's an honor for me to be here in your noble presence.Dahlia:\nHonestly, how can any woman ever count on you for anything? ...You disgust me!Phoenix:\nBut... It can't be!

It-It-It's so c-c-cold here, Nick!Phoenix:\nMaybe you should put on something warmer for a change!Maya:\nW-W-Well, it's supposed to be c-c-cold... It's t-t-training. ...Ah-Achoo!Phoenix:\n(Her teeth are chattering so loudly, it's all I can do to make out what she's saying...)Pearl:\nWow, Mystic Maya! So this is the famous Hazakura Temple!Maya:\nP-P-P-Pearly... I-I-I-I... Ah-Achoo!???:\nWell, well, well... How nice to see you here. Welcome to our temple!Maya:\nOh...! Th-Th-Thank you...

We're freezing into human popsicles as we spea--!???:\nHo ho ho. Well, we are high up in the mountains after all. In any case, we shouldn't speak here. ...Please follow me inside.Maya:\nTh-Thank you. I was starting to think I would pass--???:\nOh! Yes, yes! I almost forgot to introduce myself.Bikini:\nI'm the head nun here at the temple. My name is Bikini.Maya:\nB-B-B-Bikini...!?Bikini:\nThat's riiight! Actually, that's my \"temple\" name. What do you think? It's a tradition to have one, and I wanted something that has a nice image to it. So I thought, \"Why not choose a bikini?\" Besides, it makes me seem younger. Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho!Maya:\nIt certainly does! Oh, I signed up for your \"Special Course\"!Bikini:\nWell, my, my, my. Quite brave of you considering how cold it is! Young people can be so reckless with their health! Don't blame me if you become one with those you channel. Wa ha ha! Ho ho ho!Pearl:\nR-Reckless...?Maya:\n\"Wa ha ha\"...?Pearl:\nMaybe you should take it easy tonight, Mystic Maya... We can come back another day.Maya:\nBut you went through all that trouble to get reservations for m--Bikini:\nYes, yes, yes, that's right! You've come all this way, so please, enjoy yourselves!

It looks pretty well maintained, too. This thing kinda puts your hometown to shame, Maya.\nMaya:\nYeah... Well, a lot of things have happened in Kurain Village. We used to be a lot richer, back when people hired us to perform channelings.\nPhoenix:\nOh, I see... But now the place looks a bit run down...\nMaya:\nHmm... I guess I was just born in the wrong time.\n\n\n\n\nMain Hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nThat looks like the Main Hall where we'll be staying tonight. From here, it looks like one of those ice hotels you always hear about!\nPhoenix:\n...They gotta have a heater or something in there, don't you think? I don't wanna die.\nMaya:\nI'm not worried, I brought my hot-water bottle.\nPhoenix:\nDid you bring one for me?\nMaya:\nWhat are you talking about, Nick? Who carries around 2 hot-water bottles?\nPhoenix:\n(Brr! If the cold doesn't kill me, the ice queen over here will finish the job...)\n\n\n\n\nBell tower\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nOh, look! It's a cute little bell tower! I absolutely love the sound of a giant bell!\nPhoenix:\nOh? So, which do you like better? That or the sound of money?\nMaya:\n...! ...... Sorry, but I'll take money for the win, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What are you apologizing for?\n\n\n\n\nSnowmobile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nOh look, it's one of those snow motorcycle things!\nPhoenix:\nMost people call that a \"snowmobile\", you know.\nMaya:\n\"Snow motorcycle things\", \"Snowblowmeal\". Same thing. Hmm... Too bad we didn't invite Desirée. I bet she could race like the wind on this \"Slowmobile\"! Or maybe she'd give me ride on this \"Blowsnowbile\".\nPhoenix:\nArgh! I told you, it's \"snowmobile\"!Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanneling dojo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUmm... So what's a \"channeling dojo\" anyway?\nBikini:\nOh my, my, my... You don't even know that?\nMaya:\nForgive him, Sister, for he knows not what he is saying.\nBikini:\nWell, well, well. Just call me Bikini and forget that \"Sister\" part. A channeling dojo is basically a spiritual power training ground. We have special holy items prepared here to help people boost their spiritual power.\nPhoenix:\nH-Holy items...?\nBikini:\nIf you train an entire evening surrounded by these items... Aaah. It's quite mysterious. The spiritual power of these items seems to envelop you. Wa ha ha ha.\nPhoenix:\n(Wow, she must have just gotten off the trolley from the land of make-believe...)\nMaya:\nUm, so what exactly is the \"Special Course\"...?\nBikini:\nYou must be incredibly devoted to be interested in that at such a young age! It's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant a spell... ...30,000 times! All while being showered in freezing cold spirit water.\nMaya:\nEh...?\nBikini:\nIt's February now, right? You have to be careful this time of the year... If you don't watch it, you'll catch pneumonia or maybe even die of hypothermia... So be careful, you hear? Wa ha ha. Ho ho ho. Ha!\nMaya:\nHow am I supposed to \"be careful\"...?\nPearl:\nOh no... I knew I shouldn't have signed Mystic Maya up for this...\n\n\n\n\nThe other nun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUmm, Sister... About this picture...\nBikini:\nWell, well. Look at that. I must say I look rather divine here, don't you think?\nPhoenix:\nOh, um, yeah. Unforgettable in every way.\nBikini:\nYou mean it? Oh, I knew it! Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho ho! The makeup was pretty tough, but Iris helped me out.\nMaya:\n\"Iris\"...?\nBikini:\nThe cute little girl in the photo. She looks just like me, doesn't she? We're just a small temple here, so she and I run the entire place.\nMaya:\nReally? That kinda sounds like fu--\nPhoenix:\nSorry to cut in, but...! This \"Iris\"... Where is she right now?\nBikini:\nOh! Just listen to you! You haven't come all the way up here just to find a girlfriend, have you?\nPearl:\n... *glare*\nPhoenix:\nNo, no, no! Th-That's not what I had in mind at all...\nBikini:\nAnyway, Iris is in the Inner Temple preparing for this evening.\nMaya:\nInner Temple...?\nBikini:\nYes, yes, that's right. Iris will be back this evening. Why don't you go have a look at the Main Hall for now? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha.\nPhoenix:\n(So she's in the Inner Temple, huh...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm, do you think you could take a look at this?\nBikini:\nI may not look like it, but I can tell you I'm very much in demand. And to be quite honest, I'm finding this a little difficult to say...\nPearl:\n...What IS she trying to say, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI think she's trying to say that she's busy.\nMaya:\nBut seriously Nick, what's the deal? Nothing has even happened yet and you're already shoving evidence into people's faces. You need to forget about work and relax a little.\nPearl:\nTry to have some fun, OK Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, you're right... (Sure. Pin the hypothermia on the lawyer is great fun!)February 7Hazakura TempleMain HallMaya:\nBrr... It's fr-freezing in here, too! Achoo!Pearl:\nHee hee. It reminds me of the Meditation Room in Fey Manor!Phoenix:\n...Pearls, you've been in an unusually good mood since we got here.Pearl:\nWell, kids are made of energy, you know!Phoenix:\nAs for you, Maya, you look like you're about to catch a bad cold.Maya:\nW-W-Well, I'm not exactly a little kid anymore, I guess. Ah-Achoo!Phoenix:\n(Nngh... Is she going to make it...?)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSliding doors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI bet the writing on these sliding doors are instructions for spirit channeling... Kinda like how we scribbled math formulas on the bathroom walls to remember them. Except we couldn't go to the bathroom during tests... And I can't read these walls.\n\n\n\n\nObjects on floor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere are straw zabuton cushions arranged around a hibachi brazier... I haven't seen a layout like this since I saw this really old Japanese movie on TV. ...If it wasn't for this hibachi, they'd probably freeze to death.\n\n\n\n\nAltar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's an altar. It looks a bit old, but someone does a good job taking care of it. Speaking of altars, I remember seeing one like this in Kurain Village last year. I guess they really do have something to do with spiritual power after all.\n\n\n\n\nMagatama on altar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere's a laughably large Magatama on the altar. If I can see Psyche-Locks with the tiny Magatama I've got... ...I can only imagine what kind of power this bad boy has under his hood!\n\n\n\n\nLeft corner near altar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's a stack of straw zabuton cushions. Maya told me this type of zabuton is called \"enza\"... I suppose if I'd never come here, I'd have missed out on all these new things.February 7Suspension BridgeMaya:\nWow! Look at this broken down old bridge, Nick!Phoenix:\nY-Yeah, and look at that big canyon below us.Maya:\nHey! There's a river down there! It looks like it's flowing real fast! ...What's wrong, Nick? You look like you've seen a ghost!Phoenix:\nI-I'm just not very good with heights...Maya:\nOh... Hey! I've got it! Maybe you should face your fear and try hurling yourself off the edge? You know! One... Two... Three... Jump! It might be just what you need to get over your fear of heights!Phoenix:\n...Yeah, death is a real good way to overcome phobias alright. Anyway, it sure looks like a rickety bridge.Maya:\nCan't argue there. That's probably why it's called, \"Dusty Bridge\".Phoenix:\nRead it again, Maya. It says, \"Dusky Bridge\".Maya:\nWell, it's practically the same thing.Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCliff on opposite side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like it's about 20 yards to that cliff over there.\nMaya:\nI guess that's where I'll be training tonight. Do you want to train with me, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nAnd do the Special Course? I think not.\nMaya:\nBut it'd be so great if you had spiritual powers, too! (Really? \"I see dead people\" sounds more like a cause for alarm to me...)\n\n\n\n\nWooden sign on left side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere's a narrow path going off in a different direction than that of the Main Hall.\nMaya:\nThe sign here is so old, the text seems to have vanished.\nPhoenix:\nThe path leads to a wooden staircase that goes down to the bottom of the canyon.\nMaya:\nOK, I'll write, \"wooden staircase\" on it then.\nPhoenix:\n...Do you really think that is necessary? You'd have to be blind not to see the stairs.\nMaya:\nWell, it can't hurt. Just pass me a pencil, OK?\nPhoenix:\nGraffiti is a crime, Maya.\n\n\n\n\nBridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! Why don't we hop across the bridge. It'll be fun!\nPhoenix:\nI'm not so sure... It looks like a bunny hopping across the bridge would destroy it.\nMaya:\nOK, Nick. Then let's try to find a cute little white bunny and test your theory.\nPhoenix:\n(That right there sums up the fundamental difference between sane and insane.)\n\n\n\n\nBoulder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSome letters are engraved into a roughly cut boulder.\nMaya:\n\"D-U-S-T-Y Bridge\", huh?\nPhoenix:\nIt says, \"Dusky\"! \"Dusky Bridge\"! OK?\nMaya:\nC'mon, Nick! Take a look at that bridge and tell me it's not supposed to be \"Dusty\"! This sign is obviously wrong, and I'm gonna fix it! Now give me a pencil, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nDo I look like a pencil holder to you?\n\n\n\n\nPublic phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nI can't believe there's a public phone here. Who would ever use it?\nPhoenix:\nThe people who live here, I guess. I doubt they have any real phones there.\nMaya:\nYeah, but it took like 20 minutes to walk here from the Main Hall! ... It would've been smarter of them to build the Main Hall here, don't you think?\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe you should work on channeling someone who makes logical sense, Maya.After clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate:February 7Hazakura TempleMain HallMaya:\nTh-Th-The Main Hall... I th-think it's even c-c-c-colder in here! Achoo!Pearl:\nAh! Mr. Nick! Do you smell that? It smells like meat and gravy!Maya:\nYeah, you're right! I guess it's pot roast for tonight! Yum!Phoenix:\n...Weird. I thought they would serve something a little more... well, traditional.Maya:\nWhat are you talking about, Nick!? You think monks and nuns just sit around eating rice gruel all the time!?Pearl:\nMystic Maya is right! Ooh! I hope there's mashed potatoes, too! I love mashed potatoes!???:\nHa ha ha... What a cute little acolyte! Greetings to all of you.Phoenix:\nOh... Um, hello. (Wow, this lady makes Maya look like a 6.8/10 on the weirdness scale.)Maya:\nYour outfit... Did you come here for the Special Course, too...????:\nHa, ha, ha... Unfortunately, no. Actually, I'm...Pearl:\nAaaaaaaaaah! Y-You're...! Y-You're...! You're Ms. Elise Deauxnim!Elise:\nYes, that's right... You know of me?Pearl:\nM-M-My name... My name is Pearl Fey! I-I'm your biggest fan!Maya:\nWho is she, Nick?Phoenix:\nHmm... I see it now... Zvarri! A fortune-teller...?Pearl:\nI-I've got all your books, Ms. Deauxnim!Elise:\nHa, ha, ha... What a sweet thing to say. And please, call me Elise.Phoenix:\nUm, \"books\"...?Pearl:\nMr. Nick, don't you know anything!? Don't you even know who this is?Phoenix:\nWell, um... ...An author, maybe?Elise:\nYes, and an illustrator. ...Of picture books.Maya:\nPicture books, huh? Oh, now I get it...Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElise Deauxnim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... I'm sorry I didn't know who you are. I don't get a lot of chances to really enjoy picture books.\nElise:\nIt's alright. I take no offense to that. My books are nothing but simple stories for children.\nPearl:\nAnd really beautiful pictures too, Ms. Elise! Your books always make me feel as if my heart has been purified.\nElise:\nHa ha ha... It makes me feel very happy to hear you say that.\nPhoenix:\n(I do have to admit... She certainly seems like a kind, sensitive lady.)\nPearl:\nMs. Elise won an award last year for her book, \"The Magic Bottle\"!\nElise:\nYes... A friend of mine secretly submitted a story I had written to a publisher. They liked it so much that they asked if it was alright to make it into a book.\nPhoenix:\nWow... It must have been a really great story.\nMaya:\n...Maybe I should try to write a children's book, too. If I do, you can secretly send it to a publisher for me, Nick.\nElise:\nRecently, I've accepted a sort of... apprentice you might say.\nPhoenix:\nAn apprentice?\nElise:\nHe calls himself Laurice... Laurice Deauxnim. I believe he's off doing some landscape sketches now... On Laurice's behalf as well, I'd like to thank you for your support.\nPearl:\nOf course, Ms. Elise! Anything for you!\nElise:\nHa ha ha...\n\n\n\n\nWhy come here?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPearl:\nUm... Why did you come to Hazakura Temple, Ms. Elise? Are you here... to do some spiritual training?\nElise:\nHa ha ha... No, that's not it. I'm actually here to gather materials for a new book I'm working on.\nPearl:\nWow! I-I can't wait to read it!\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls is completely taken with her...)\nElise:\nI wanted to do a book with a more Japanese feel to it this time.\nPhoenix:\n...So is that why you're dressed like you are?\nElise:\nThe children have a certain image of me in their minds. I don't want to disappoint them...\nPhoenix:\n(What can I say... She's really a sweet lady...)\nPearl:\nWow, Ms. Elise, you're dressed up like a mountain nun!\nElise:\nYes. The good people here were kind enough to let me borrow this... I'm wearing training clothes underneath my robe, as well.\nMaya:\n...I want a staff like that.\nElise:\nYou like the crystal sphere? It's real amethyst, you know.\nMaya:\nMaybe we'll find one like that up here on this mountain. Good luck, Nick! I know you'll find me one!Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMs. Deauxnim? What do you think about this?\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Do you think Ms. Elise is a suspect?\nPhoenix:\nHuh...?\nPearl:\nYou may be Mystic Maya's special someone, but I won't let you do this to Ms. Elise!\nPhoenix:\n(A suspect? Why would I suspect her of anything? It's not like anything's happened.)\nMaya:\nIsn't it cute, Nick? Pearly's getting all overprotective of her new friend.After clearing all Talk options:Elise:\nWell, you'll have to excuse me now... I have to go help with the dinner preparations.Pearl:\nWow! You mean you're cooking dinner tonight?Elise:\nThat's right. Would you like to help too, Pearl?Pearl:\nYes, yes! I want to help with whatever I can!Phoenix:\n(Pearls looks like she just won the lottery...)Maya:\nOh, I'll help too, then...Elise:\n...No, it's fine. Please don't worry about it. Feel free to relax and explore the area with your friend.Maya:\nHuh!? But...Elise:\n...Oh, yes! Please take this. I think it will be of help to you. It's a map of the area. We wouldn't want you to get lost now, would we?Phoenix:\n(The \"Inner Temple\"... There it is, on the other side of the bridge...) Well, if you insist, I guess we'll take this chance to go check out the other temple.Hazakura Temple Map added to the Court Record.Pearl:\nOK! I'll see you two later then! Remember! You're not allowed to fight!Maya:\nCome on, Nick! Let's go! At least we'll stay warm if we keep moving!February 7Hazakura TempleMain GateMaya:\nHuh? Where did Sister Bikini go?Phoenix:\nI guess she went to the Inner Temple... To go help that other nun out.Maya:\nOh, right... I think her name is... Iris?Phoenix:\nY-Yeah... That was it. (I want to find out who Iris really is, but I'm scared of what I'll find...)Maya:\n...?February 7Inner Temple GateMaya:\nWhoa, that bridge was shaking like jello in an earthquake.Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nAnd at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I bet. (Changed from [And at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I'd bet.] in the original release)Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nNot to mention the last part only had like one board left on it!Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nWhat's wrong with you? Your face is all green.Phoenix:\nC-Can you not pick on me for a second? I'm still trying to get over the shock that we made it safely across that death trap.Maya:\nYeah, I guess I'm a bit surprised, too... Yikes! That \"temple\" is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse at any time... (Changed from [Yikes! That 'temple' is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse anytime...] in the original release)Phoenix:\nI guess people don't use it too often. Is this really where you're going to train tonight?Maya:\nThat has to be it. It's kinda creepy around here... Like a ghost might jump out at you or something!Phoenix:\n(A spirit medium afraid of ghosts...? Isn't it ironic, don't you think?)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI don't care how much you pay me, I don't want to cross that bridge again.\nMaya:\nNo worries, Nick. No one is offering you any money.\nPhoenix:\nThat's because no reasonable person would call that pile of popsicle sticks a bridge! The latter half of it was nothing more than a few planks of wood and some string!\nMaya:\nHey, if we want to get back, we've got no choice but to cross it again, you know.\nPhoenix:\n... Maybe I'll just stay... I've always dreamed of living in a little shack in the woods.\nMaya:\n...Wow, you really are scared, aren't you?\n\n\n\n\nSuspension wire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nIt looks like this bridge is suspended by 4 of these wires.\nPhoenix:\n...They're reeeally thin. Shouldn't they be just a little thicker...?\nMaya:\nOh, stop it! You're such a worrywart, Nick! If the bridge were really going to collapse... ...I'm pretty sure the boards would break before these wires ever did!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nWhat's wrong? You're turning into an over-ripe avocado again.\n\n\n\n\nBuddha statues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nOh, wow! Look at these neat Buddha statues. Maybe I'll take one home with me.\nPhoenix:\nMaya!\nMaya:\nBut there are so many. They wouldn't notice if I took just one.\nPhoenix:\nAre you kidding? Of course they'll notice! What are you gonna do with one of those anyway?\nMaya:\nPut it in the office of course! We can trade that wooden statue in the office reception area for one of these!\nPhoenix:\n(You know, come to think of it, where did that wooden statue come from anyway...?)\n\n\n\n\nIncinerator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nHey! There's a giant robot buried in the snow!\nPhoenix:\n... Well, there's something buried in the snow, but... I think it's an incinerator.\nMaya:\nOh... Hee hee. But you've gotta admit it looks a lot like a robot.\nPhoenix:\nUm, sure... Anyway, I don't think it gets used much. It's looking pretty rusty.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Do you think this Giant Robo-cinerator can walk?\nPhoenix:\nI told you! It's not a robot! ...And it's not especially big either.\nMaya:\nBah, you have no imagination. I thought it'd be real neat if you had to beat it to advance.\nPhoenix:\n(A fight between a lawyer and an overgrown furnace? Who'd ever pay to see that!?)\n\n\n\n\nYellow gate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nHey! A half-opened gate! That's practically a welcome mat!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, except the sign on here says, \"No Entry\".\nMaya:\nUmm, Nick. Rules are made to be broken, you know.\nPhoenix:\n...You expect a lawyer to go along with that?\nMaya:\nOh, come on! You're such an old lady sometimes! Let's just go!\nPhoenix:\nDon't blame it on me when Sister Bikini puts a curse on you.\nMaya:\n... Now you've got me scared. Um, let's just forget about it, OK?\n\n\n\n\nWooden log on left\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nLooks like there's something written on it.\nPhoenix:\nI can't read it, but if I had to take a good guess, I'd say it says, \"Inner Temple\".\nMaya:\nWhat's the point of a sign if you can't read it? Must be tough for the mailman when he's delivering here.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess the sign is a good indication of how long this place has been here...)\n\n\n\n\nGate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nSo that's the Inner Temple up ahead, huh?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks kinda run-down.\nMaya:\nWell, it wouldn't be very temple-like if it was all bright and shiny.\nPhoenix:\nSo you're training here tonight, huh?\nMaya:\nYup! Then everyone'll see my spiritual powers!\n...Uuurrrgh...ggnngh...ggh...\nPhoenix:\nSounds like your stomach wants to show off its digestive powers instead...\nMaya:\nI wonder if that roast is ready yet?February 7Inner TempleTraining HallPhoenix:\nMan, look at this place... It's just a tiny, freezing-cold room. So this is where you'll both be training, huh...Maya:\nHuh? What do you mean, \"both\"? I'm the only one.Phoenix:\nReally? But I thought...Maya:\nPearly's just a little kid. She couldn't handle this kind of intense training.Phoenix:\n(So says the girl who I can barely hear over her teeth chattering...) (Changed from [So says the girl who I can barely hear over her bones chattering...] in the original release)Maya:\nAnyway... The real training room must be behind that door over there. Hmm... Yup, definitely getting the feeling it's back there. (Changed from [Yeah, I get the feeling it's back there, definitely.] in the original release)Phoenix:\n(Even I can sense that there's something supernatural about the cavern behind that door...)

It-It's nothing...Maya:\nI wonder why she spaced out like that. Don't you, Nick?Phoenix:\nUh... D-Did you say something, M-Maya?Maya:\n... Not you too, Nick...Iris:\nI... M-My name is Iris. I'm one of the nuns here at this temple.Maya:\nI'm Maya Fey. It's a pleasure to meet you!Iris:\nThe pleasure is mine... ... Oh, er, please excuse me! I have some... um, chores to attend to.Maya:\nShe sure is beautiful... and a bit spacey, I guess...

Hmph... Nothing! Just a bunch of clothes. Hey, Nick.\nPhoenix:\n... Huh! Oh, sorry. I was just... thinking.\nMaya:\nOh? About Iris, I bet! Looks like you've been bitten by the love bug, Nick!\n\n\n\n\nMattresses\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere are a bunch of musty looking blankets and bedding sets piled up here. I wonder why they're even here in the first place? \nMaya:\nIt's because all spiritual training is done under the supervision of a nun. I wonder if Sister Bikini is planning to sleep in here while I train? \nPhoenix:\n(But if they sleep, what's the point of having them here in the first place...?)\n\n\n\n\nSacred cavern entrance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nThe actual training area must be on the other side of this door.

She just laughed that gentle laugh of hers and listened!\nPhoenix:\n(Are you sure she wasn't just laughing at you...?)\n\n\n\n\nIris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nWhoo yeah! Her! My little Iris!\nMaya:\nShe's really pretty.\nButz:\nThis girl... She's perfect! She's exactly my type! I wonder if she would model for me. I want to draw a portrait of her.\nMaya:\nYeah, you always liked those model types, didn't you Larry? ...Hey, wait a sec! Didn't you say you were swearing off women...?\nButz:\nHuh!? Yeah, that's right. Of course I have! I have... basically. But...\nMaya:\n\"But\"...?\nButz:\nBut... Iris is different. I feel like... I feel like I still have one chance left at the dream...\nPhoenix:\n(This guy will never change.)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nHey, I know I may not look like it, but I'm an artist. I refuse to look at anything that doesn't have a radiant or beautiful motif.\nPhoenix:\n(Picky, picky, aren't you...?)After clearing all Talk options and presenting Iris profile:Pearl:\nEveryone!Maya:\nHey! Pearly!Pearl:\nDinner preparations are complete! Please come quickly to the Main Hall!Maya:\nAlright! I can't wait to dig in, Pearly!Pearl:\nI'm going to go to the Inner Temple and call Sister Iris! I also want to have a look at where Mystic Maya is going to be training...February 7, 7:46 PMHazakura TempleMain HallMaya:\nBoy am I stuffed...Phoenix:\nAre you sure it's alright to eat that much before your training?Maya:\nWell, this kind of training is a battle of endurance.Pearl:\nMystic Maya... Please don't do anything that might put your health at risk.Maya:\nHa ha ha. No pain, no gain, I guess.Pearl:\nNngh... I'm still worried about you...Bikini:\nWell, well, well. Let's not dilly-dally shilly-shally. You must get ready for tonight.Elise:\nGood luck. ...Maya.Maya:\nAlright! Here I go! I'll see you all tomorrow, I guess!Bikini:\nIris, please ring the bell at 10:00 for lights out, alright?Iris:\nYes, Sister Bikini.Bikini:\nAnd then, after you ring the bell, I want you to come join us at the Training Hall.Iris:\nI understand, Sister Bikini.Phoenix:\n(Maya and Bikini really seem excited about this training thing tonight...)Elise:\n...Well, Pearl? What are you going to do tonight?Pearl:\nWell, umm...Elise:\nIf you'd like, you can come to my room. Perhaps we can read some books together.Pearl:\nR-Really!? I'd love to! I, umm... I'm not very good at reading.Elise:\nHa ha ha. Well then, would you like to practice reading with me?Pearl:\nAh! I'd love to!Phoenix:\n(Pearls is absolutely smitten with Ms. Deauxnim...) So Larry, what are you going to do?Butz:\nHuh... Me? Um, well... I'm just gonna hang out in my room. I can't stand the cold at all.Phoenix:\n(I totally hear you there.)Pearl:\nUm, Ms. Elise? So, for example, how do you read this?Elise:\nIt says, \"gravely\"... That's kind of a tough word.Pearl:\nOh! OK! And what about this word?Elise:\nThat's another tough one. It says, \"roast\".Phoenix:\n(What kind of a book is she reading anyway...?)Pearl:\nWell, I'm going to go wash the dishes and help clean up. I'll go visit you when I'm done, Ms. Elise!Phoenix:\n(Well, not much to do except head to my room and huddle under the covers, I guess...)February 7, 9:12 PMHazakura TempleMain HallPhoenix:\n(Ugh... It's a whole different type of cold up here in the mountains! Argh... Why couldn't the nearest bathroom be just a little closer to my room...?)???:\n...Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nYaaaaaaah! Oh! Ah, Ms. Deauxnim! Are you going to use the bathroom, too?Elise:\nUm, no. But... Have you seen Pearl?Phoenix:\nNo... Not since after dinner. I thought she said she was going to go to your room...Elise:\nI know... But she never showed up. I-I'm going to go look for her. ...Excuse me.Phoenix:\n(Ms. Elise Deauxnim... A woman as mysterious in origin as her last name... But... The really mysterious one is...)Iris:\nOh...Phoenix:\nAh...! S-Sister Iris...!Iris:\nG... G-Good evening...Phoenix:\n(The real mysterious one is this girl...!)Iris:\nUm, are you on your way to the bathroom too, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n(...I can't let this chance pass me by! I should try to talk with her... And maybe get some answers.)Move\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n...It's freezing cold out there. And dark, too. There's nothing I need to do, so I think I'll just stay roasty-toasty in here.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... You're Sister Iris, right?\nIris:\n...Yes.\nPhoenix:\nS-So... um, when did you come to Hazakura Temple?\nIris:\n... I don't remember. Ever since I was a small child, the temple has been my home.\nPhoenix:\nSo you've never left?\nIris:\nWell, I don't have any family left to take care of me... Sister Bikini... I've come to think of her as my real mother, as it were.\nPhoenix:\nAh, I see... But you... Didn't you go to college? ...And maybe enroll with the Ivy University Literature Department?\nIris:\nNo, I never had an interest in going to a big university like that... My training is all the education I need.\nPhoenix:\nI... I see...\nIris:\nBut... Once in a while, when I get the chance, I make a trip to the nearby town. I can use a computer and a cell phone, too.\nPhoenix:\n... (That's not exactly something worth bragging about... But I don't see any Psyche-Locks... ...so I guess that means she's not lying...)\nIris:\nP-Please don't stare at me like that...\n\n\n\n\nHazakura Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of a place is this anyway? I heard it's for training to increase your spiritual power or something like that.\nIris:\nIt must seem awfully crazy to normal people like you.\nPhoenix:\nWell, I have to admit it is a whole different world up here...\nIris:\nI'm glad to hear you say that.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nIris:\nTalking with dead people... Who does it help anyway? ...I hate it.\nPhoenix:\nR-Really? (So then why stay in a place like this...?)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Instead of showing her things, I really need to just listen to her story! This girl... Just who is she?)After clearing all Talk options:Iris:\nAh...Phoenix:\nIs something wrong?Iris:\nI-I didn't realize it was so late. I have to go and ring the bell for lights out...Phoenix:\n(I guess it's almost 10:00 now, huh?)Iris:\n... Um... Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n...Yes?Iris:\nIf it's alright with you... I would like you to have this.Phoenix:\nBut this is your hood...Iris:\nIt has the power to protect you from evil spirits.Phoenix:\n(Come to think of it, Sister Bikini was wearing one of these, too...)Iris:\nI pray for your safety on this dark, cold night.Iris's Hood received from Iris.Iris:\nI'm sorry, but I must bid you goodnight.Phoenix:\nWait a minute, Sister Iris...Iris:\nY-Yes...?Phoenix:\nJust now, you called me by my name... You said, \"Mr. Wright\". How did you know my name? I never introduced myself to you.Iris:\nTh-That's...Phoenix:\n...Sister Iris. Please, tell me the truth. You and I... Have we ever met before?Iris:\n...5 PSYCHE-LOCKSPhoenix:\nI-Iris...Iris:\nO-Oh! It-It's almost 10:00...

On the ground...!) M-Ms. Deauxniiiiiim!...*squish*Phoenix:\n(...I just stepped on something soft.)Bikini:\nHey! Don't step on my tummy like that!Phoenix:\nWh-What are you doing lying there in the snow!?Bikini:\nI was passed out! What do you think!?Phoenix:\nSo that blood-curdling scream was you...?Bikini:\nF-Forget about that! H-Hurry up and call the police!Phoenix:\nIs there even a phone in the Main Hall?Bikini:\nNo, but we still get reception up here in the mountains! You must have a cell phone on you, right!?Phoenix:\nI, um... I didn't bring it with me--Bikini:\nOh, you're useless! I mean, even Iris has a cell phone... We've got no choice! You'll have to use the public phone by Dusky Bridge! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Run as fast as you can!Phoenix:\nY-Yes, ma'am...Bikini:\nIf you don't hurry, Iris will... Iris will...!February 7, 11:18 PMDusky BridgePhoenix:\n...*huff*...*huff*... (It's farther than I thought. The bridge is just up ahead. I have to go tell Maya what happened, too!) ............ ...Aaaaaaaaaah! Dusky Bridge...! It's burning down! (What the heck happened!?)Butz:\nWhat are you doing here?Phoenix:\nAaaaaaaaah!Butz:\nHuh? What is it? Is it me?Phoenix:\nD-Don't scare me like that, Larry! I almost had a heart attack!Butz:\nMy name isn't Larry! It's Laurice!Phoenix:\nLarry, hurry up and call the police! I'm going to the Inner Temple!Butz:\nD-Don't be stupid! The bridge is nothing but a burning wreck right now!Phoenix:\nListen to me! There's been a murder! Here! At Hazakura Temple!Butz:\nWha-Whaaaaat!?Phoenix:\nThe murderer might have fled across the bridge! I have to make sure Maya is safe!Butz:\nB-B-But...Phoenix:\nPlease! Call the police! I've got to go! ...Get outta my way, Larry!Butz:\nIt-It's too dangerous! Nick, w-wait!Phoenix:\n(I must have been crazy... I knew how dangerous it was, but I still went for it...)...*crack!*...Phoenix:\nAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!Butz:\nNiiiiiick----!Phoenix:\n(Weakened even more by the fire, the rickety old bridge's planks snapped and gave way.

This is nothing more than a terrible nightmare... I'll just roll over and...)Butz:\nW-Wait! Don't hang up! ...It's an emergency! It's Nick! H-He...

Tell me!Butz:\nTalk about a guy with bad luck! He may already be dead! Anyway, you've got to come back! You're the only one that can help! My Iris... My beautiful Iris!

Hurryyyyyy!Phone:\n...*beep*...Edgeworth:\n(It's been one year since I left that country... I thought I wouldn't have to see him again for a while... Sounds like it won't be a pretty reunion... As if I expected anything to change.)February 8, 2:19 PMDetention CenterVisitor's RoomButz:\nYou're late, Edgey! What took you so long!?Edgeworth:\nI don't want to hear it! I chartered a private jet to come as quickly as I could!Butz:\nWell, you should've chartered a faster one! Anyway, just listen! Something happened to Ms. Elise... and Nick is... Maya... and Iris's Bikini... ...Huh? Say something, Edgey!Edgeworth:\n...Before I came here, I stopped in at the hospital where Wright is. I believe I have a better understanding of the situation than you, at this point. The murder victim was the picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. She was found by Wright and the head nun. The suspect is the temple's younger nun. Then later, while Wright was crossing the bridge, it broke and he fell into the river. The hospital says that he'll need at least 2 days of bed rest.Butz:\nY-Yes! Th-That's right! You got it! B-But they arrested her... My sweet little Iris!Edgeworth:\n(And here I was, convinced HE was the one the police had arrested...) However... I still don't understand what these two items are for.Butz:\nWhat are you talking about?Edgeworth:\nThey're things Wright gave to me when I was leaving his room. (This is the first... He said some nonsense about being able to see into people's hearts with this... And the other... He couldn't possibly be asking what I think he is... could he?)Butz:\nI'm begging you! Iris's trial starts tomorrow! With Nick out of the picture, you're all I've got left! You're the only one that can represent her!Edgeworth:\n... What did you just say?Butz:\nYou know! REPRESENT! DEFEND! What were you expecting!? Why do you think I called you anyway!?Edgeworth:\n...I'm a prosecutor, Larry. A prosecutor. Do YOU understand what I'm saying? A prosecutor is a lawyer who...Butz:\nDon't talk to me like a kid! I graduated from junior high, you know! Don't worry about it! I promise I won't tell!Edgeworth:\nBut I...Butz:\nI mean, I heard a paper badge had no problem fooling an entire court before!Edgeworth:\n(...How could this country's judicial system have fallen into such decay!?)Butz:\nPlease, Edgey! At least listen to her... Listen to Iris's side of the story!Edgeworth:\n(So Wright wasn't joking when he gave me this badge after all...)Iris:\nThank you for coming. ...My name is Iris.Edgeworth:\n...Edgeworth. Miles Edgeworth. I don't know if I can be of any help, but... ...I will at least hear what you have to say. ...About the murder.Iris:\nUm...Edgeworth:\n...?Iris:\nM-Mr. Wright! H-H-How is he? Mr. Laurice said that he... That he might even die...Edgeworth:\n... Fortunately, he will be fine. (Larry, you moron! How could you say something like that!?) He was badly bruised when he hit the water, but otherwise he is unharmed.Iris:\n... Thank goodness...Edgeworth:\nBut, he's caught some kind of nasty cold.Iris:\nA cold...?Edgeworth:\nHe's running a high fever and is drifting in and out of consciousness.Iris:\n...Edgeworth:\n(I must be imagining things. This woman... I feel like I've met her before...)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurveillance camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe camera is glaring at me. \"If something glares at you, it's only polite to return the favor,\" is what I was taught. ...\nIris:\nUm... Is something bothering you?\nEdgeworth:\n...Hm? Oh, e-excuse me.\n\n\n\n\nGuard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe guard is glaring at me. \"If something glares at you, it's only polite to return the favor,\" is what I was taught. ...\nIris:\nUm... Are you alright, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n...Hm? Oh, e-excuse me.Move\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Going to a crime scene is akin to entering a jungle teeming with dangerous beasts. Before he goes there, a hunter needs to make sure he has plenty of ammunition. And in my case, that \nammunition is called, \"information\".Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nPardon me... Iris. I would like to ask you something, if you don't mind. I have the distinct feeling you and I have met before...\nIris:\nI-It must be your imagination, Mr. Edgeworth. After all... I hardly ever leave Hazakura Temple.\nEdgeworth:\nHazakura Temple? What's that?\nIris:\nIt's a place where those who wish to boost their spiritual power come to train. You need to undergo some very difficult training to release your inner spiritual power.\nEdgeworth:\nSpiritual power...? Did you go to that temple for that reason as well?\nIris:\nNo... I don't have any spiritual powers. I don't need them.\nEdgeworth:\nIn that case, what are you doing at that temple then?\nIris:\n... I... I've committed some sins. Sins that I need to pay for. That's why I'm there, and why I continue to train... To purify my soul.\n\n\n\n\nThe night of the crime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI want to ask you about last night... The night of the crime.\nIris:\nAlright... I helped to clean up after dinner, and then went back to my room at about 8:00. Later, I left my room to ring the lights out bell at 10:00.\nEdgeworth:\nBell...?\nIris:\n...We ring it at the same time each night.\nEdgeworth:\nI see... And then?\nIris:\nA-And then...\nEdgeworth:\n...?\nIris:\nI was told to go to the Training Hall, but... I went back to my room... and stayed there...\nEdgeworth:\nWhy didn't you go to the Training Hall like you were asked to?\nIris:\n...I-I was frightened.\nEdgeworth:\n(\"Frightened\"...?)\nIris:\nSo I just stayed in my room and meditated... until the murder happened.\nEdgeworth:\n(There's more to her story.  I just know there is. Maybe  I should dig a little deeper.)\n\n\n\n\nFrightened? (appears after \"The night of the crime\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou were asked to go to the Training Hall on the night of the murder?\nIris:\nYes...\nEdgeworth:\nHowever... You didn't go. Because you say you were frightened. What exactly were you so frightened of?\nIris:\n...!\n\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Wh-What in the world!?)\nIris:\nUm... Is there something wrong?\nEdgeworth:\n...I'm sorry. It's nothing. (It looks like she's not aware of them herself... These must be what Wright was talking about... The \"Psycholocks\"! I believe he said that I need to present this \"Magatama\" item to do something...)\nIris:\n...?\n\n\n\n\nFrightened? (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nI... I don't like to walk alone at night. And, last night was...\nEdgeworth:\nWhat about last night?\n\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n\nIris:\nEr, oh... nothing. It's rather silly...\nEdgeworth:\nSo there was something special about last night, hmm?\nIris:\nNngh...\nEdgeworth:\n(It looks like I have no choice but to break these locks...)\n\n\n\n\nAny idea? (before clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night?\nIris:\n...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed.\nEdgeworth:\nSpiritual power...?\nIris:\nYes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example...\nEdgeworth:\n...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science. I don't believe in \"spiritual power\".\nIris:\nYes... I understand. Most people don't.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd I am certain that the thing that killed the victim was a human. So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim?\nIris:\n... No. I'm not the one who took her life.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... (That was foolish of me... It's not as if I can know for certain if she is telling me the truth...)\n\n\n\n\nAny idea? (after clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night?\nIris:\n...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed.\nEdgeworth:\nSpiritual power...?\nIris:\nYes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example...\nEdgeworth:\n...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science.

So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim?\nIris:\n... No. I'm not the one who took her life.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... (Those Psycholock things aren't appearing... I suppose that means I can believe that she's not lying.) ...Heh.\nIris:\nWhat's wrong?\nEdgeworth:\n(I can't believe what I'm thinking... And here I just finished saying that I don't believe in spiritual power...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nIs that an attorney's badge?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, this belongs to Wright.\nIris:\nReally?\nEdgeworth:\nI'm actually a prosecutor.\nIris:\nOh...! Then why do you have a defense attorney's badge pinned on your lapel...?\nEdgeworth:\nWell, you see... I, um... I borrowed it.\n\n\n\n\nHanging Scroll\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWho is the woman on this hanging scroll?\nIris:\nWell, I don't know the details, but... I've heard she's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique.\nEdgeworth:\nM-Master?\nIris:\nYes. Mystic Misty. She was a great spirit medium. ...That's what I've heard. I also heard that she went missing over 15 years ago.\nEdgeworth:\n... Spirit mediums... There's no such thing anyway...\nIris:\nMr. Edgeworth...?\nEdgeworth:\nI know all about them... They're nothing but frauds!\nIris:\n...?\nEdgeworth:\n(She doesn't know anything about it, of course... But there was a time, 17 years ago, when I met the \"Master\" myself...)\n\n\n\n\nIris's Hood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nThat's called a \"Demon-Warding Hood\". ...I gave that to Mr. Wright last night.\nEdgeworth:\nHe was wearing this when I saw him at the hospital today.\nIris:\nIt's an important item for protecting acolytes from evil spirits.\nEdgeworth:\nIf it's so important, then why did you give it to him?\nIris:\nLast night... I felt... something... I felt that something terrible was about to happen... I... I didn't want Mr. Wright to fall into its grip.\nEdgeworth:\n(Well he wound up falling into something much deeper and colder... I probably shouldn't say that out loud, though. Thank god for inner monologue.)\n\n\n\n\n\"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\n...I was against the idea of our temple appearing in that magazine. I was afraid that... this type of a tragedy might occur.\nEdgeworth:\nIn that case, why did you allow them to run an article about you?\nIris:\nIt was Sister Bikini... She's actually rather fond of attention... Surprisingly so.\nEdgeworth:\n(She certainly does look rather happy in this photo...)\n\n\n\n\nPhoto of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nThat's Mystic Elise Deauxnim. She's a picture book author, or so I've heard.\nEdgeworth:\nDoes she come to Hazakura Temple often...?\nIris:\nNo... This was her first time. It's just that...\nEdgeworth:\n...?\nIris:\nShe was a very important visitor.\nEdgeworth:\nIs that so?\nIris:\nYes, Sister Bikini told me, \"Be certain not to offend her.\"\nEdgeworth:\n(The victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim... The prosecutor's office still doesn't have much information about her it seems...)\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix Wright profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nMr. Wright... How bad is his cold?\nEdgeworth:\nWell his fever is very high. As a result, he's rather confused. He's worried about Maya, who is still trapped in the Inner Temple... ...And he's quite worried about you as well, it seems.\nIris:\n...Really?\nEdgeworth:\nYes... Naturally, once he recovers, I'll pass the baton back to him.\nIris:\nNo... Don't... I'm sure that Mr. Wright wouldn't want that... He wouldn't want to defend me.\n\n\n\n\nLarry Butz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nOh... That's Mr. Laurice.\nEdgeworth:\n...I'm sorry? Who did you say it was?\nIris:\nLaurice Deauxnim. He is Mystic Elise's apprentice, I think.\nEdgeworth:\n(Alright... Now who exactly is this guy...?)\nIris:\nHe's a very sincere, hard-working person.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nIris:\nUm... Did I say something wrong, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nE-Excuse me. I was temporarily at a loss for words. (Take a trip... Come home... Be thrust suddenly into bizarro world...)\n\n\n\n\nIris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nYou want to know about me? There's not much to tell, I'm afraid.\nEdgeworth:\nJust let me get one thing straight. You were raised at Hazakura Temple, correct? And yet, somehow, you seem to know Wright.\nIris:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nSo you two must have crossed paths somewhere.\nIris:\n...No, Mr. Edgeworth. Whomever it was... ...it couldn't have been me.\nEdgeworth:\n(What is that supposed to mean?)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nI'm sorry... I don't leave the temple grounds very often... So I don't know very much about the outside world.After clearing all Talk options:Edgeworth:\nHmm... It appears that's about all that you can tell me.Iris:\nThank you very much for listening to my story.Edgeworth:\n...I visited Wright at the hospital before coming here. He asked me to take care of you...Iris:\n...M-Me?Edgeworth:\nYes, at the trial tomorrow... He asked me to defend you.Iris:\n... If Mr. Wright has that much faith in you, Mr. Edgeworth... ...Then I will gladly entrust my fate in your capable hands.Edgeworth:\nBut before that, I have one question.Iris:\nYes?Edgeworth:\nDo you know Wright?Iris:\nEr... Wh-Why would you ask that?Edgeworth:\nWhenever you came up in our conversation, he would begin to act a little... strange.Iris:\n... Mr. Edgeworth... What is Mr. Wright to you? (Changed from [Mr. Edgeworth... Are you his friend?] in the original release)Edgeworth:\n...He is a very dear and indispensable friend. (Changed from [Friend? Well... In a sense, yes.] in the original release)Iris:\n... It was 5 years ago... That's when I... That's when I... deceived him.Edgeworth:\nYou \"deceived\" him...?Iris:\nI heard that he was... in a lot of pain after what happened. I know what a weak person I am. That's why... That's why I thought it was best if he never saw me again. I wanted him to just forget about me, without learning the truth.Edgeworth:\n... Well, if you ask me, Wright is still suffering... And until he learns the truth, I don't think he will ever be able to truly recover. ...Iris. It's not too late. You should go to him. ...Tell him the truth.Iris:\n...Edgeworth:\nI'll defend you, but only if you agree to that one condition.Iris:\n... Alright, Mr. Edgeworth... I promise.Edgeworth:\n...Very well. I'll do everything in my power to get you an acquittal. (That's enough information gathering for now. I should head to the crime scene...)February 8Dusky BridgeEdgeworth:\n(It sure is cold alright... So this is it... Dusky Bridge...)???:\nOh, wow! It's you, Mr. Edgeworth! (Changed from [Ahem! M-Mr. Edgeworth!] in the original release)Edgeworth:\nNngh... Detective Gumshoe. (Changed from [Urk... Detective Gumshoe.] in the original release)Gumshoe:\nLong time no see! It's been about a year? ...Or has it been longer?Edgeworth:\nIt doesn't matter, Detective. What does matter is why you're shuffling around up here.Gumshoe:\nOh, ouch! ...And there's that sharp left jab! (Changed from [Oh, ouch! ...And there was a sharp left jab!] in the original release) Well, I'm happy to see you anyway, Mr. Edgeworth!Edgeworth:\nLet me guess... You were transferred by HR to the local precinct? (Changed from [Let me guess... You were transferred into another section at work.] in the original release) A wise decision. The vast amount of nothing up here should be quite easy to guard. (Changed from [A good choice. The vast amount of nothing up here must be quite easy to guard.] in the original release)Gumshoe:\nI heard you were back in the country and arranged to come all the way out here! Everybody was real nice. They even let me take charge of the investigation, sir.Edgeworth:\n(...Gumshoe indeed! Like gum on your shoe, he's impossible to get rid of!)Gumshoe:\nI'm supposed to report on the details of the crime scene, sir! Anyway! Here I am! Detective Dick Gumshoe! Reporting for duty!Edgeworth:\n...Great. Um, thank you, Detective.Gumshoe:\nI thought Prosecutor Godot was gonna get here before me. That guy's a real mystery, I tell you!Edgeworth:\n(...Prosecutor Godot?)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCliff on other side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt looks like a pretty good distance to that far cliff.\nGumshoe:\nYeah... It's gotta be around 100 yards or so.\nEdgeworth:\n... Detective... That's not even CLOSE to a hundred yards.\nGumshoe:\nWell... I gotta admit I'm not very good at judging distances.\nEdgeworth:\n(It's about 20 yards or so. And impossible to cross without a bridge, it seems...)\n\n\n\n\nWooden sign on left side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThere's a little shack down that way called, \"Heavenly Hall\".\nEdgeworth:\nA shack...?\nGumshoe:\nIt's like a run-down doghouse for losers that can't bear the freezing drafts of wind... Kinda reminds me of my apartment, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nThe name \"Heavenly Hall\" makes it sound like a palace...\nGumshoe:\nGiving a hovel a great name is a crime itself! I'd call it false advertising! By the way, the name of my apartment complex is \"Compton Castles\"...\nEdgeworth:\n...That's not such a great name, if you ask me.\nGumshoe:\nWell, it's not such a great apartment either, sir.\n\n\n\n\nBridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo this is the bridge Wright tried to cross?\nGumshoe:\nPretty reckless, if you ask me.\nEdgeworth:\nI'm amazed he survived the fall from up here...\nGumshoe:\nYeah, he's one lucky guy, sir. Now I see how he manages to win his cases in court. Blind luck.\nEdgeworth:\n(I think dumb luck suits Wright just a bit better.)\n\n\n\n\nBoulder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSome letters are wildly engraved into a roughly cut boulder. \"Dusky Bridge\"... It certainly is an appropriate name.\nGumshoe:\nYou need to get some glasses, Mr. Edgeworth! That sign says, \"Dusty Bridge\". I can see how you read it wrong, though, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nYou're the one who needs glasses, Detective. Try reading it one more time.\nGumshoe:\n... Ah! You're right! It's \"Dusky Bridge\" after all! ... I guess whoever wrote this made a mistake!\n\n\n\n\nPublic phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nHey! It's a public phone! You don't see a lot of these anymore!\nEdgeworth:\n...That's true.\nGumshoe:\nSince we've got one here, why don't we take a photo as a memento!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, um, sure. Why not?\nGumshoe:\nOh, darn it! I don't have a camera with me! ...I'm gonna go buy a disposable camera! I'll be right back, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n(What's so special about public phones, and why is he so fascinated by them...?)Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened (before visitng Main Hall)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case...\nGumshoe:\nIt's simple!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, simple is as simple does, as they say.\nGumshoe:\nOh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing!\nEdgeworth:\nA witness...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that Bikini lady.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Bikini lady\"? Here? On this freezing cold mountain?\nGumshoe:\n...Well, you should talk to her yourself if you want the details, sir.\nEdgeworth:\n(I may have to talk to this \"bikini lady\"... I mean, \"decisive witness\" myself...)\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened (after visitng Main Hall)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case...\nGumshoe:\nIt's simple!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, simple is as simple does, as they say.\nGumshoe:\nOh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing!\nEdgeworth:\nA witness...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that Bikini lady.\n\n\n\n\nDusky Bridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo this is the bridge that Wright fell through?\nGumshoe:\nYup! I can't imagine being that reckless myself... \"Look before you cross,\" is how it goes, right? Or was that \"leap\"...?\nEdgeworth:\nAnd? Is there something on the other side?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, some old building they call the Inner Temple... But we can't get over there without a bridge, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat...?\nGumshoe:\nNobody lives there, so it's usually not a problem... But someone was at the Inner Temple doing some training and now they're stuck there.\nEdgeworth:\nYes, I heard that from Wright. It's Maya Fey.\nGumshoe:\nOh no... Her again...? Anyway, the air's really turbulent right now so we can't do an aerial extraction. No one's gonna be able to reach the Inner Temple until tomorrow, sir.\nEdgeworth:\n(Will she be alright in this cold...?) So how did this bridge burn down anyway?\nGumshoe:\nWe're almost 100% sure it was lightning.\nEdgeworth:\n...Lightning?\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor Godot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo who is this Prosecutor Godot? I've never heard of him.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, he's a new guy... Showed up after you left the country! He's a complete rookie, but nobody can say a bad word about the guy.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat kind of a man is he?\nGumshoe:\nHe just became a prosecutor recently, but he's good, sir. Real good.\nEdgeworth:\n(If he's so good, how is it that I've never heard of him...?) Is he the lead prosecutor on this case?\nGumshoe:\nYou bet he is! After all, \"you know who\" is right in the middle of it.\nEdgeworth:\n\"You know who\"?\nGumshoe:\nPhoenix Wright, of course! For some reason, Godot has really got it in for Mr. Wright!\nEdgeworth:\nOh?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, he seems to have some kind of a grudge.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd what would be the cause of this grudge...?\nGumshoe:\nI dunno... Maybe he made fun of his mask or something.\nEdgeworth:\n(None of this is making any sense. I'd better look into this Godot myself.)\n\n\n\n\nLightning (appears after \"Dusky Bridge\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning?\nGumshoe:\nYup. Last night it snowed for the first time in 3 days. It's a little unusual for lightning to occur during a snow fall like that... But according to the weather data, lightning definitely struck.\nWeather Data added to the Court Record.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm, I see... This is a very detailed weather report... Almost too detailed... It even has the exact time that the lightning struck the bridge...\nGumshoe:\nOh, that? We got that information from the witness's testimony.\nEdgeworth:\nSomeone actually saw the lightning hit the bridge? Who is this witness?\nGumshoe:\n... Sorry. I'll go ask one of the local cops later, sir.\n\n\n\n\nLightning (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning?\nGumshoe:\nYup.

What's that thing doing on your lapel, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n...Is it really that odd?\nGumshoe:\nYou bet it is, sir! A prosecutor wearing a defense attorney's badge? That's like a detective with a license to kill!\nEdgeworth:\n(Does this little thing hold that ominous of a meaning...?)\n\n\n\n\nMagatama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHave you ever seen this thing before...?\nGumshoe:\nHey, thanks a lot. I was getting kind of hungry! ...*chomp!*\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What are you doing, Detective!?\nGumshoe:\nAck! ...I thought it was some kind of candy that would fill me up, sir. Lately I've been feeling so hungry all the time...\nEdgeworth:\n(Nngh... Maybe his salary has been cut just a little too much...?)\n\n\n\n\nPhoto of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThere's a lot we don't know about this victim... We don't know her real name, her background... We don't know anything really.\nEdgeworth:\nThat's rather odd... If she was trying to hide her identity, why would she become an author?\nGumshoe:\nI'll bet it was just one of those things. You know... She probably never expected to get so popular.\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix Wright profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nWhenever something happens, this guy always shows up like he hasn't got a care. In fact, you know what...? Every time he shows up, I always wonder the same thing. \"Maybe somehow he's actually the cause of all these incidents!\"\nEdgeworth:\n(I wonder if Gumshoe has realized it yet... But you could say the exact the same thing about him!)\n\n\n\n\nDick Gumshoe profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYour face is more drawn out than the last time I saw you over a year ago.\nGumshoe:\nR-Really? I thought so!\nEdgeworth:\nNo, wait... It's not so much \"drawn out\", as \"weary and tired\", or maybe just plain old \"thin\".\nGumshoe:\nI thought that too, sir. My salary's been kinda on the low end... So yeah, my food options have been kinda non-existent. Off-brand chicken soup, off-brand spaghetti, off-brand bread... That sort of stuff.\nEdgeworth:\nI thought you were really into instant noodles last year...?\nGumshoe:\n...I got really sick of the stuff after a while, sir.\n\n\n\n\nLarry Butz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nHe's supposed to be Ms. Elise Deauxnim's apprentice or something.\nEdgeworth:\n...I see.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, he drew a nice portrait of me.\nEdgeworth:\n...That's nice.\nGumshoe:\nBut he made me pay him 50 cents for it.\nEdgeworth:\n...I'm sorry about that.\nGumshoe:\n... You don't seem very interested in him, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\n...I really don't want to talk about him. That's why.\n\n\n\n\nIris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI feel like I've seen this girl somewhere before! She wasn't from a prior case, was she?\nGumshoe:\nNope, can't be. We did a database search with her fingerprints and came up with nothing.\nEdgeworth:\nI see... (I just can't shake this nagging feeling...)\nGumshoe:\nWell, everyone knows that you are quite popular with the ladies, sir... Maybe she's an old girlfriend that you sent to Dumpsville when you were younger.\nEdgeworth:\nD-Detective! Where did you hear such nonsense from!?\nGumshoe:\nI didn't hear it from anyone. It's just sorta how I imagine you to be... sir.\nEdgeworth:\n(...D-Do I really inspire this sort of frothing desire from the female masses?)\n\n\n\n\nGodot profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI usually hear about promising young prosecutor candidates while they're still in school. But I've never seen or heard of this person.\nGumshoe:\nI gotta admit... He's puzzling alright. He just appeared one day, big mug of steaming coffee in his hand...\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... He sounds like an interesting man...\nGumshoe:\nYeah... The whole prosecutor's office is really into double espresso macchiatos lately.\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nLook, I'm just your everyday, simple detective. Don't ask me such tough questions, OK?\nEdgeworth:\n...That's not something to be proud of, Detective!February 8Detention CenterVisitor's RoomEdgeworth:\n(It looks like Iris is being interrogated right now.) ...This place certainly brings back memories.Gumshoe:\nOh yeah. Come to think of it, you got thrown in here once too, didn't you, sir? But you know what? I've never been in jail a single time!Edgeworth:\n(I should think it's hard to land in jail when you're so harmless...) Yes, well... If you're in jail, you don't have to pay for your own meals, you know.Gumshoe:\n...*gasp!* ...Edgeworth:\nDon't get any funny ideas, Detective...!Gumshoe:\n...Too late, I already did.Edgeworth:\n(In any case... I guess I'll have to come back here later...)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurveillance camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThat camera is meant to monitor everything that happens in here. And right now, it's pointed straight at the guard.\n\n\n\n\nGuard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe guard is staring at me with a puzzled expression on his face. Me... and the badge on my lapel. ...I get the feeling he recognizes me.February 8Hazakura TempleMain GateButz:\nYo! Edgey! What took you so long!? I'm so cold, my brain's turned to sherbet.Edgeworth:\n...I knew it was a mistake to race back to this country.Butz:\nWh-What do you mean...?Edgeworth:\nWright is going to be fine, and the case itself isn't anything unusual...

What's going on here, Mr. Edgeworth!?Edgeworth:\nUm, it's hard to explain, but one thing led to another and...Butz:\nWhat kind of lame excuse is that!? And you call yourself a defense attorney!?Gumshoe:\nProsecutor Edgeworth is a prosecutor, and that's why he's Prosecutor Edgeworth! \"Prosecutor Edgeworth, Defense Attorney\" just sounds plain old weird, pal! ...Right, Prosecutor Edgeworth!?Edgeworth:\n(...I'm not sure what role I'm supposed to be playing anymore.)Butz:\nHmph!

I just know it, OK!? So trust me on this one!Edgeworth:\nEver the romantic, aren't you, Larry? Nevertheless, I'll do whatever I can to prove her innocence.

Like a fine wine, it gets better with age!\nEdgeworth:\nEven fine wine turns to vinegar and begins to stink at some point. ...I suggest you wash that atrocious rag you call a coat, Detective.\n\n\n\n\nMain Hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThat must be the Main Hall back there.\nGumshoe:\nA brilliant deduction, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n............

There's something I've always wondered about...\nEdgeworth:\n(Something tells me he's going to tell me what's on his mind, whether I like it or not...)\nGumshoe:\nWe call a person who tells a lie a \"liar\", right? So why don't we call a person who rings a bell a \"beller\"? Or \"truer\" for a guy who tells the truth!

After all, I saved his life.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is that supposed to mean?\nButz:\nIf I hadn't called for help so quickly, he would have died. It's no surprise though. I used to be a security guard.

What is the \"greater\" one like?\nBikini:\nThe \"Greater Magatama\" is displayed in the Main Room of Fey Manor. It was supposed to be shown at the Treasures of Kurain exhibit... But, it was so large that they couldn't bring it through the doors.\n\n\n\n\nLeft corner near altar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(There are more enza cushions in the corner of the room.) ...What's that white piece of paper sticking out from under that stack...?\nGumshoe:\nHmm... Beats me.\nEdgeworth:\nWould you mind checking that for me, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir! Here you are, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nIt looks like an old manila envelope...\nGumshoe:\nEeeeeeeeeeaaaah!!\nEdgeworth:\n...What is it, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nTh-This... This could be it! An ultra important clue! A super-special clue!\nEdgeworth:\n...I suppose I should read it myself then.\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like a letter addressed to Sister Iris. \"tonight at 10 at Heavenly Hall. ... ...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed.\"\nEdgeworth:\nTh-This sounds like a blackmail letter...!\nNote to Iris added to the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\nNice going there, Mr. Edgeworth! Why can't I ever find clues like that!? You're an ultra-important prosecutor!! A super-duper prosecutor!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, I suppose it takes a super-duper kind of dumb to miss a clue like this.\n\n\n\n\nLeft corner near altar (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(There are more enza cushions in the corner of the room.)\nGumshoe:\nNice going there, Mr. Edgeworth! Why can't I ever find clues like that!? You're an ultra-important prosecutor!! A super-duper prosecutor!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, I suppose it takes a super-duper kind of dumb to miss a clue like this.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe night of the crime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nFirst, I'd like to ask you about last night.\nBikini:\nWell, last night... we had an acolyte here for training. After dinner, the two of us went to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple.\nEdgeworth:\n(She must be talking about Maya...) Approximately what time was that...?\nBikini:\nI suppose it was about 9:00 when we left here. Training lasts all night long. It's extremely exhausting. The channeling dojo's Head Nun must be in attendance at all times to keep watch.\nGumshoe:\nWow, you're right! That does sound exhausting!\nEdgeworth:\nDetective, this is no time for flattery.\nGumshoe:\nSorry.\nEdgeworth:\nSome time around 11:00, you witnessed the incident in the courtyard. But your duty was in the Inner Temple. Why did you come back here?\nBikini:\nHmm... The way you're staring at me, I'm starting to get goosebumps! Ha ha ha ho ho!\nEdgeworth:\n(Nngh... I'm starting to get goosebumps myself, but for a decidedly different reason.)\nGumshoe:\nHo ho, you get the chills pretty easy, don't you Mr. Edgeworth?\n\n\n\n\nWhat you saw\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAlright then... I'd like you to tell me exactly what you saw in the courtyard.\nBikini:\nIt must have been past 11:00. Ah! No! I can't say it! It-It's too much for my poor heart!\nGumshoe:\nHey! Calm down, lady! L-Let go of my tie!\nBikini:\n...I saw two people! One of them was lying on the ground... Th-The other one was stabbing her from the back... with a sword!\nEdgeworth:\nDid you see this criminal with your own eyes?\nBikini:\nI didn't want to believe what I was seeing...! ...But it was Iris!\nEdgeworth:\nYou must have been quite shocked.\nGumshoe:\nOf course she was! Try putting yourself in her shoes! It'd be like if you were stabbing Mr. Wright smack in the middle of a courtroom! And I happened to witness it from the witness stand! ...I'd be pretty shocked too.\nBikini:\nI know it sounds insane... But that's what I saw. And when I finally realized what I was seeing, I screamed, and then... I passed out.\nEdgeworth:\n(...Unfortunately for us, her testimony seems to be pretty solid.)\nBikini:\nHowever... The idea of Iris doing such a foul act seems... unnatural.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Unnatural\"...?\nBikini:\nThe girl I know simply isn't capable of this sort of foulness...\nEdgeworth:\n(...I wonder what she means by that?)\n\n\n\n\nWhy return? (appears after \"The night of the crime\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAs the head nun, it's your duty to stay with the acolyte at all times, correct?\nBikini:\nYes, that's correct. I know I may look strong, but the truth is... I've got a bad lower back.\nEdgeworth:\nA bad lower back...?\nBikini:\nYes, it's especially bad in the winter. So bad that I can't even lift a bucket. Do you remember how cold it was last night? My bad back felt as stiff as frozen glass. I just wanted to take a nice hot bath to ease my aching back... That's why I returned to the Main Hall.\nEdgeworth:\nSo you left the disciple all alone?\nBikini:\nDon't be ridiculous! I would never do that! That's why I ordered Iris to the Inner Temple after she had rung the bell for lights out.\nEdgeworth:\n(Yes, but she never went to the Inner Temple, did she? So did this head nun actually see Iris there? (Changed from [Did this head nun even see Iris?] in the original release) I think I'd better try to get some more details...)\n\n\n\n\nThe acolyte (appears after \"What you saw\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo who is this acolyte that was to train at the Inner Temple...?\nBikini:\nHer name is Maya Fey... I treated her very badly, I'm ashamed to say. And after she went through the trouble of signing up for the Special Course...\nGumshoe:\n\"Special Course\"?\nBikini:\nIt's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant 30,000 times...\nEdgeworth:\nYou don't mean to tell me she's still doing that over at the Inner Temple, do you?\nBikini:\nNo, no, no. Of course not! You don't have to worry about that one little bit. Last night, we still hadn't started the training session itself.\nEdgeworth:\nWell, um... That's good to hear.\nBikini:\n...Oh! Dear, dear! There's one thing I forgot to tell you.\nGumshoe:\n...Uh-oh, I don't think I like the sound of this.\nBikini:\nDo you know that small girl? I believe she is Mystic Maya's little sister.\nEdgeworth:\n(Maya has a little sister...?)\nGumshoe:\nOh, you mean little Pearl! That's Maya Fey's cousin.\nEdgeworth:\nLittle... Pearl...?\nBikini:\nI thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after we'd finished with dinner cleanup... (Changed from [I thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after cleaning up dinner...] in the original release) But I haven't seen her at all since late last night! She's nowhere to be found!\nEdgeworth:\nY-You mean she...!? She was with the victim!?\nBikini:\nIt's all the fault of my stupid, creaky old back!\nEdgeworth:\n(A little girl who was with the victim on the night of the murder... is gone!)\nGumshoe:\nAs they say... \"The plot thickens!\"Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagatama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nTh-That's...! That's one of the Fey clan's very own Magatamas! That's a priceless treasure you've got there!\nGumshoe:\nW...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me!\nBikini:\nYes... You don't look it, but now I can see you're a real fan of the occult!\nEdgeworth:\nExcuse me?\nBikini:\nOh, of course this piece couldn't possibly be real, but to have such a nice replica... Clearly, you are a big fan of the Kurain Tradition!\nGumshoe:\nW...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me!\nEdgeworth:\n(I should have known better than to show this thing around...)\n\n\n\n\nHanging Scroll\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nHuh... Ahh! Well, well, well... Look what you've found! That's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, Mystic Misty Fey!\nEdgeworth:\n\"Fey\"...\nBikini:\nIt's been nearly 20 years since Mystic Misty's disappearance. Apparently, she intended to pass on the Master title to her daughter.\nEdgeworth:\nWho is this daughter?\nBikini:\nWell, I myself am part of a branch family of the Fey clan. But even I am not privy to information concerning the main family...\n\n\n\n\nIris's Hood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nWell, well, well! That's a Demon-Warding Hood! Acolytes are highly susceptible to possession by evil spirits, you know. That's why we always wear these for protection.\nEdgeworth:\nOh, I see...\nBikini:\nWhat are you waiting for? You won't get any protection just by holding it, you know! Put it on already!\nEdgeworth:\nNo! I can't...! I was just...!\nBikini:\n... Ha ha ha ho ho ho!\nGumshoe:\nHo ho ho! It's like it was made just for you, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean by that, Detective!?\nBikini:\nIt looks absolutely marvelous! You've just got to keep it on for a while!\nEdgeworth:\n(Is this some sort of divine retribution...?)\n\n\n\n\n\"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAbout this picture...\nBikini:\nWell look at that! I look pretty s-to-the-exy, don't you think!?\nGumshoe:\nUm, ah... Y-Yeah. Absolutely.\nBikini:\nUp until recently, we've avoided exposure in such magazines. But this time we had our reasons...\nEdgeworth:\nIs that so? For exampl--?\nBikini:\nHa ha ha ha ha!!! Well, why deny the world the sight of such a lovely face!?\n\n\n\n\nPhoto of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\n...Ohhhh! H-How could such a... terrible thing have happened...? It's all... It's all... It's all my fault!\nGumshoe:\nWell come on, lady... I don't think you need to take all the blame yourself.\nBikini:\nQuiet! What do you know anyway!?\nGumshoe:\n...Ouch. You're scary!\nBikini:\nWith that stupid 5 o'clock shadow and that stupid old coat of yours... It's too bad that you weren't the one that disappeared!\nGumshoe:\n... ...Why does she have to take it all out on me?\nEdgeworth:\n(Her anger does seem a little... manufactured.)\n\n\n\n\nNote to Iris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nDo you know anything about this old, crumpled-up letter?\nBikini:\n... Is that addressed to Iris?\nGumshoe:\nYup, it clearly says \"To Iris\" on it.\nBikini:\nI can't believe it... That girl doesn't have any secrets from me...\nEdgeworth:\n(Ah... So Sister Bikini didn't know anything about it...)\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix Wright profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nThis man... His face betrays a life of suffering and great weariness of the world.\nEdgeworth:\n...Um, sure.\nBikini:\nBut even so... I can't believe this guy actually jumped into the river! Think of all the fun things he might have enjoyed if he had just lived... Relentless spiritual training alone is no way to lead a complete life, huh...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n(It sounds like she's got some major regrets she's dealing with... Hmm... Perhaps I should let Gumshoe explain Wright's situation to her for me...)\nGumshoe:\nH-Hey! Don't look at me like that! Do you own dirty work! ...Sir!\n\n\n\n\nLarry Butz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nThis is Mystic Elise's apprentice, is it not? I think he might have a bit of a crush on me... Sweet boy at any rate.\nGumshoe:\nHuh?\nBikini:\nOh, I don't blame him. Sister Bikini understands the temptations of young men.\nEdgeworth:\n...Sure.\nBikini:\nBut I'm afraid it wouldn't be proper to abuse my position. I am head nun, after all. But, in return, I did allow him to draw a portrait of me.\nEdgeworth:\n(I pray it was a pose that maintained your modesty. For everyone's sake...)\n\n\n\n\nIris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou said you went with Maya to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple last night. Did you happen to see Iris while you were there?\nBikini:\nOf course I saw her. I told her to meet us after ringing the 10:00 bell for lights out.\nGumshoe:\nSo you're saying Iris came to the Inner Temple then?\nBikini:\nOf course she did. Iris has always been a good, obedient girl. After that, I had Maya begin her training ceremony.\nEdgeworth:\n(But that doesn't fit with Iris's story at all... She said that she never went to the Inner Temple!)\nGumshoe:\nAs they say... \"The plot thickens!\"\n\n\n\n\nBikini profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nIt's all my fault... Me and my stupid back! Mystic Elise has been murdered, an important acolyte is trapped... ...and a little girl has been lost!\nGumshoe:\nYou know you really shouldn't be so negative. It creates bad karma...\nBikini:\n...Quite right. I need to do some more training myself, I think...\n\n\n\n\nMaya Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nShe's a very important visitor, you know! An honored acolyte!\nEdgeworth:\n\"Honored\"? How so?\nBikini:\nThe Fey name is synonymous with the Kurain Channeling Technique. Therefore, she must be a spirit medium of great power indeed.\nGumshoe:\nNow that you mention it, one year ago... ...there was a case that was about the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique!\nEdgeworth:\n...Detective. I detest talk of supernatural drivel. I suppose now you'll say she has midi-chlorians?\nGumshoe:\nHo ho ho. So it gives you the creeps, huh, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n(...That's got nothing to do with it.)\n\n\n\n\nPearl Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nOh, this poor girl... Where could she have gone...?\nGumshoe:\nWell, we checked out her home and she's not there.\nBikini:\nAnd she's nowhere in the vicinity of the temple either...\nEdgeworth:\n(Which means... ...there's only a few other possibilities as to where she could be.)\nGumshoe:\nAh! Do you think maybe she fell off the bridge and was carried downstream...!?\nEdgeworth:\n... Why do you have to be such a pessimist, Detective!?\nGumshoe:\nNngh... I was just trying to think like you, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\n(Ironic. I became a pessimist only after I had the pleasure of working with you!)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nUmm, about this here...\nBikini:\nHmm... Let me see... Well, as you may know... In order to see reality for what it truly is... ...we strive to break our attachments to much of the transient, material realm. I guess you could call me an \"immaterial girl\"!\nGumshoe:\nI guess she lives in an immaterial world, huh Mr. Edgeworth?Main Gate (before clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nI'm just no good with people like her.

Gotta make sure I don't leak the prosecution's whole investigation...Edgeworth:\nDon't worry about it, Detective.

Let's see if we can summarize what we've learned so far.\nGumshoe:\nOK! Let's take a look at the map. ...According to the testimony of Sister Bikini, the head nun... ...right after they'd finished dinner, she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple. (Changed from [...she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple right after dinner was finished.] in the original release) At 10 PM, after ringing the bell for lights out, Iris went to the Inner Temple. When she got there, Bikini had her take over while she went back to Hazakura Temple. After taking a hot bath to soothe her back... ...Sister Bikini witnessed the murder in the courtyard! If you want more details, you should ask Bikini herself in the Main Hall.\nEdgeworth:\n(The Inner Temple, huh...? I'd like some more information about that place...)\n\n\n\n\nTomorrow's trial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe trial begins tomorrow, but who's the prosecutor?\nGumshoe:\nI'm pretty sure it's that Godot guy, but... ...nobody can get a hold of him, so they're looking for a replacement.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean...?\nGumshoe:\nIt's really weird. All of a sudden, no one can reach him! Hmm, I wonder if the rumors are true. Maybe since Mr. Wright caught a cold and won't be defending, he just lost interest.\nEdgeworth:\nI intend to appear in court in the role of defense lawyer. However... I would be quite unhappy if it came out that I'm actually a prosecutor.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, I can see why. But I'm not the one you have to worry about... I think the real problem is gonna be that judge...\nEdgeworth:\n...Yes, he certainly would remember my face, even after such a long absence. That's why I requested another judge preside over the case. We've only met each other once. There's a good chance he won't remember me at all.\nGumshoe:\nY-Yeah, but... what about the prosecutor? Everyone in the prosecutor's office must know you! Wouldn't it be a problem if someone there made a big stink, sir?\nEdgeworth:\nThere's no need to worry. I pulled a few strings and arranged for a prosecutor of my own choosing.\nGumshoe:\nWow, Mr. Edgeworth... I had no idea you had such a powerful string to pull!\n\n\n\n\nInner Temple (appears after \"What happened\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this Inner Temple that Maya was supposedly training at...?\nGumshoe:\nAccording to Bikini, it's an old building they use for training the acolytes. It's on the other side of Dusky Bridge.\nEdgeworth:\n(The bridge that burned down, huh...) Is there anything else on the other side of that bridge besides the Inner Temple?\nGumshoe:\nNope, not a thing.\nEdgeworth:\nNothing?\nGumshoe:\nThe other side is surrounded by cliffs on all sides... In a way, it's kinda like a little island out there.\nEdgeworth:\n(So the only thing there is the Inner Temple...)\nGumshoe:\nI hear it's not the kind of place a person could survive in.\nEdgeworth:\n(Please be alright, Maya...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictim's Staff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nOh, so I think I might have already told you about this, but... The truth is... When I was a little kid...\nEdgeworth:\nYou wanted to become a wizard, right?\nGumshoe:\nHey, that's amazing! How did you know that!? So? What do you think? I'd make a really great one, don't you think?\nEdgeworth:\nWe just had this conversation a little while ago, Detective!\n\n\n\n\nShichishito\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThis sword represents the multiple branches that life can take, all ending as one.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... I've never heard that one.\nGumshoe:\nYou know what I think about sometimes? What kind of life would I have had if I hadn't joined the Homicide Division.\nEdgeworth:\n...So you think about that kind of thing too, huh?\nGumshoe:\nOf course I do. I think about it a lot. Me as a traffic cop. Me as a detention officer. Me as the Blue Badger...\nEdgeworth:\n(...I guess he doesn't have any plans to leave the force.)\n\n\n\n\nBikini profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThis is the witness who saw the crime take place out there in the temple courtyard. I'm pretty sure it's gonna be her testimony that'll be key to this case, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nSo you mean she's going to be a witness in the trial tomorrow...?\nGumshoe:\nOf course! A nun is as trustworthy as you can get! We got this one in the bag! ... Oh. I-I mean, I've always been on your side, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! So yeah, this is a pretty tight spot we've gotten ourselves into, huh!?\nEdgeworth:\n(Now I understand why Wright is always breaking into a cold sweat...)\n\n\n\n\nMaya Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI wonder if Maya is alright? I could never show my face to Wright again if something were to happen to her.\nGumshoe:\nAww, it'll be OK. If that ever happens, you can just show him my face. How's that...?\nEdgeworth:\n...\nGumshoe:\nAck! Um, I didn't mean it like that, sir! It was just a silly little joke!\nEdgeworth:\nI wonder if there is another way to get across to the other side? The support wires for the bridge are still intact, correct?\nGumshoe:\nThat bridge is almost 20 yards long... I know I may look like it, Mr. Edgeworth, but I'm no super hero.\nEdgeworth:\n(In any case, I just hope Maya is alright...)\n\n\n\n\nPearl Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat about Pearl...? Has no one seen her at all since last night?\nGumshoe:\nSeems that way... Apparently, she hasn't gone back to Kurain Village either, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nBut it's true that she was with Elise Deauxnim at some point last night?\nGumshoe:\nNo doubt about it. Ah...! Y-You mean that maybe whoever killed Ms. Deauxnim also...!?\nEdgeworth:\nD-Don't jump to any crazy conclusions!\nGumshoe:\nOooooouuuch! ...You sure have one mean punch, Mr. Edgeworth! It's down-right fierce!After clearing all Talk options in Dusky Bridge, clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate, clearing all Talk options and examining left corner near altar in Hazakura Temple - Main Hall, and clearing all Talk options and examining staff and Ami Fey statue in Hazakura Temple - Courtyard:February 8Detention CenterVisitor's RoomIris:\nAh...

Where is it on this map...?\nIris:\n...It's around here. To get there, you must follow a small path down from Dusky Bridge... The reality is, to get to the Inner Temple, I had no choice but to cross that bridge. But the thought that such a terrible criminal could be lurking at Heavenly Hall... I... I was so scared by the whole affair that I didn't even want to think about it. (Changed from [I...

Maybe I'll find some sign of our mystery blackmailer.) In any case, you still claim to have never left your room last night?\nIris:\nYes. That's exactly right.\nIris's Testimony added to the Court Record.\nEdgeworth:\nThe trial starts tomorrow... I promise you, I will win. I'm going to win so that you and Phoenix Wright can see each other again.\nIris:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nBut when I do... ...you must promise me that you will tell him your secret.\nIris:\n... But it's pointless...\nEdgeworth:\nWhy would you say that?\nIris:\nBecause I may know who Phoenix Wright is... But... He has no idea who I am.\n\n\n\n\nFrightened?

Maybe I'll find some sign of our mystery blackmailer.)\n\n\n\n\nInner Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI just finished speaking with the head nun of Hazakura Temple. She testified very clearly as to what happened. She said she saw you stab Ms. Elise Deauxnim with a sword.\nIris:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nAnd one other thing. She said that when Maya Fey began her training at the Inner Temple... ...you were there as well.\nIris:\nWhat...!?\nEdgeworth:\nWhen I spoke with you last, you claimed that you never went to the Inner Temple. And yet, Sister Bikini says she met with you at the Inner Temple that very night.\nIris:\nB-But I... I didn't go there! I didn't go to the Inner Temple last night.\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm... It looks like she's unwilling to tell me the whole truth.

Understand?\nIris:\nY-Yes, sir...\nEdgeworth:\nThe smallest flame can sometimes bathe a case in a whole new light... In my years in court, I've seen it happen over and over again. That's why I'm committed to searching until I have those answers. Now then, is it really true that you didn't go to the Inner Temple last night...?\nIris:\nY-Yes, I swear... I already told you that.\nEdgeworth:\n...Yes. You said you didn't go because you were frightened.\nIris:\n...Th-That's right.\nEdgeworth:\nIf that's the case... ...then the obvious question is, \"What were you so afraid of?\"\nIris:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nIris... I wonder. Is this what frightened you so much that you couldn't even leave your own room!?\n\n\n\nPresent Note to Iris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I found this in the Main Hall. It is addressed to you.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nPerhaps THIS is what you were afraid of! ...Well!?\nIris:\nI-I'm sorry, but... you're wrong...\nEdgeworth:\nHuh...? Why is your voice trembling like that?\nIris:\nIt's just that... Your eyes... Your eyes are scaring me...\nEdgeworth:\nUrk! (Blast! I must be trying too hard to bluff.) ...Please excuse me. I'm still not used to this role I've been assigned.\nIris:\nN-No, I should apologize... I'm sorry for being such a scaredy-cat.\nEdgeworth:\nAnyway... I'm still determined to find the answers to this mystery.\nIris:\nBut I'm telling you, I really was in my room all last night.\nLeads back to:\n\"If that's the case...\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI found this in the Main Hall. It is addressed to you.\nIris:\nAh... Th-That's...!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, Iris...?\nIris:\nWhy... Why are you glaring at me like that?\nEdgeworth:\nYou were scared of the blackmailer who wrote this to you, isn't that correct!?\nIris:\nAaaaah!\n\n1 LOCK BROKEN\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Was it the evidence or the power of my glare that broke that lock...? Oh well, I don't suppose it matters either way.)\nIris:\nB-But, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\n...Yes?\nIris:\nI thought that letter was just someone playing a prank on me...\nEdgeworth:\nA \"prank\"?\nIris:\nWell, yes... After all, even if I did have a \"secret\"... ...there's no one to tell it to that would cause me any grief.\nEdgeworth:\n... Hmm... I wonder about that.\nIris:\nSister Bikini is like a mother to me. I would never hide anything from her!\nEdgeworth:\nNo, you may not have anything to hide under normal circumstances. However! Last night was different.\nIris:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nUnfortunately, I don't know the exact nature of your secret yet. However...!

Is it just possible that maybe... ...you yourself have a deep, dark secret in your heart?\nEdgeworth:\n...! Why do you say that...!?\nIris:\nAs they say, it takes one to know one.\nEdgeworth:\n(How could she have known about that...? Is she peering into my soul!?) ...It's true that there is a deep-seated darkness in my heart. However, the only way I can get rid of it is to fully uncover the truth!\nIris:\nYou mean... the truth behind my secret?\nLeads back to:\n\"Unfortunately, I don't know the exact nature of your secret yet.\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nPhoenix Wright...\nIris:\nAh...!\nEdgeworth:\nYou mean something to Wright, it seems... And I can tell he holds a special place in your heart as well. That's why you didn't want him, of all people, to know your deep, dark secret. Well? What do you have to say?\nIris:\n... I should've expected as much... Especially from a friend of his...\n\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nUnlock Successful\n\n\n\nNote to Iris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis letter... It appears to be addressed to you.\nIris:\n... I think it's someone's idea of a joke, Mr. Edgeworth. That's why I threw it away.\nEdgeworth:\n(She's not giving me a straight answer for some reason. I'm going to have to find someone else who can give me more information about this.)\n\n\n\n\nShichishito\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nI-Is that the murder weapon?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, it is. Have you ever seen it before?\nIris:\nY-Yes. Mystic Ami was holding it... in the courtyard...\nEdgeworth:\n(And apparently, the head nun witnessed the whole sad affair... She saw you stabbing Ms. Elise Deauxnim with this very sword last night...)\nIris:\n...?\n\n\n\n\nLarry Butz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nOh... That's Mr. Laurice. He's a very sincere, hard-working person. He was even kind enough to draw a portrait of me.\nEdgeworth:\n(Knowing Larry... ...this woman is exactly the type that he would fall in love with at first sight.)\n\n\n\n\nBikini profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...I'd like to ask you about Sister Bikini, the head of Hazakura Temple.\nIris:\nShe raised me as if she were my real mother.\nEdgeworth:\n\"As if she were your real mother\"...?\nIris:\nI was left at Hazakura Temple when I was just a small child. And she's taken care of me ever since.\nEdgeworth:\nForgive me for sounding rude, but what about your family?\nIris:\n... I'm sorry, but I'd rather not talk about this.\n\n\n\n\nMaya Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nOh... This is the woman who was to undergo training last night. She seems like a very strong, reliable woman.\nEdgeworth:\n... (Whatever else anyone has to say about this Iris woman... ...I can't exactly say she's the best judge of character.)\n\n\n\n\nPearl Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nThis is the trainee's younger sister, correct? She's cute as a button! And she seems to really love mashed potatoes and gravy!\nEdgeworth:\n...Oh?\nIris:\nShe even said she was going to have the leftovers for dinner the next night... And then she took the leftover potatoes and the whole pot of gravy with her to her room.\nEdgeworth:\n(That's quite an appetite for such a little girl...)February 8Heavenly HallGumshoe:\nWhoa! Not much of a view down here, huh? It's still better than the view from my apartment, though.Edgeworth:\nTsk! Someone's here! Hide yourself, Detective!???:\nOh! Why why why!? Why does this always happen!?Butz:\nWhenever I find a girl I like, they always run away! I even chased one of them to Japan... Next it's going to be prison, I guess. (Changed from [I even chased one of them to Tibet... Next it's going to be prison, I guess.] in the original release) ...I'll steal that detective's wallet. That'll get me locked up for sure. ...Nah. I can't do that to someone who looks like he's down on his luck.Gumshoe:\n...He's just talking to himself.Edgeworth:\nShh! Be quiet and listen!Butz:\nI knew it... I shouldn't have done that! I blew it again...Edgeworth:\n(\"Done that\"? What did he do, I wonder...)Gumshoe:\nHey! You! About what you just said... I got an objection!Butz:\nWh-Wh-Wh-What the...!? Ed-Edgey! You dirty rat!Edgeworth:\n*glare* (Gumshoe... You oaf...!)Gumshoe:\nI-I'm sorry, sir! Before I knew it, I was shouting out, \"Objection!\". And in a loud, commanding voice, too! I even pointed with my pointer finger!Edgeworth:\n...You've watched too many trials.Gumshoe:\nI'm sorry!Edgeworth:\nOK, Larry, the jig is up. What have you got to say for yourself?Butz:\nUngh...Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEagle River\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThis is the Eagle River, sir. It runs pretty fast, so it doesn't ice over, even in the winter.\nEdgeworth:\nIf it had iced over, Wright would have been in some serious trouble.\nGumshoe:\nYou're right about that! He would've landed on the ice, and slid downstream to who knows where.\nEdgeworth:\n(...Not exactly what I meant, but alright...)\n\n\n\n\nDusky Bridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt's a little far, but I have a pretty clear view of Dusky Bridge from here.\nButz:\nAhh. I still can't believe it! ...Really.\nEdgeworth:\n...? What is it, Larry?\nButz:\nHuh! Err, uhh, nothing. It's nothing!\nGumshoe:\nSounds pretty suspicious to me!\nEdgeworth:\n(Something about that statement smells... And you know what they say...)\n\n\n\n\nStairway\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThese go all the way to Dusky Bridge. It's a pretty long, but easy, walk.\nGumshoe:\nI fell down 4 times on my way down here, sir!\nButz:\nOh, sorry about that, Detective. I ate four bananas and tossed their peels on the stairs on my way down here...\nGumshoe:\n... What!? So that's what I was slipping on!\nButz:\nBe careful on the way back. Those deadly banana peels are still out there.\nGumshoe:\nHmm... That's a real important piece of information right there, Mr. Edgeworth!\n\n\n\n\nString of flags\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this festive-looking ornament?\nButz:\nIt reminds me of art class in grade school. We used to have a lot of fun decorating the classroom with origami. Remember?\nEdgeworth:\nW-Well, I...\nButz:\nOh, yeah... You were never any good at it.\nGumshoe:\nReally?\nButz:\nYeah, this guy was so bad, he couldn't even fold a dollar, let alone a crane. Everyone tried to comfort him, but he would just sit there sobbing.\nGumshoe:\nReally? I never would have expected that.\nEdgeworth:\nBe quiet already! I'll never forget the shame of that day! You want a crane! I can now make a perfect quarter-inch crane without a single flaw!\nButz:\n... You know, Edgey... Nothing for nothing, but a quarter-inch crane without a single flaw is not easy.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's quite a feat, Prosecutor Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\n(Grr... This is exactly why I hate childhood friends...)\n\n\n\n\nShack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThat's a horrible graffiti problem you've got there, pal.\nButz:\nYou don't know anything, Detective. This is art! It's an expression of my bittersweet love for Iris.\nEdgeworth:\nLarry. Do you know what the difference between graffiti and true art is?\nButz:\n... It's how the artist himself defines it, right?\nEdgeworth:\n... (I should've seen that one coming.)\nGumshoe:\nWell, if that's the case, then all of my lunchboxes are masterpieces too, pal!\n\n\n\n\nRoof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe straw roof is totally covered with freshly fallen powdery snow.\nGumshoe:\nWow, makes a nice image, doesn't it? I always did like the rustic look.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Heavenly Hall\"... I suppose it's an appropriate name in some sense.\nButz:\nYou got that right. Look at that bridge up there. This place has to be heaven, because that thing is hell.\nEdgeworth:\n... You would do well to remember, Larry... ...that this is a sacred place to some people.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeavenly Hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this little shack anyway?\nButz:\nWell, I just discovered it myself yesterday.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd why were you down here in the first place?\nButz:\nErr, come on... I'm an artist... I was looking for a good place to sketch. This is a great little place! It's err... artistic. It's quiet, it's cold, it's got no power, and it looks like it's about to collapse.\nGumshoe:\n...Sounds a lot like my apartment there, pal.\nEdgeworth:\n(One thing's for sure... No one is likely to show up and disturb you here...)\nButz:\nSo can I get you something to drink? Some hot water, maybe?\nGumshoe:\n...He's getting all buddy-buddy on us, sir.\n\n\n\n\nIris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\n...Listen to me, Edgey. You've gotta do this... You've gotta save Iris!\nEdgeworth:\nWhy are you so sure she's innocent? Because she's cute?\nButz:\nWatch your mouth! Anyway, I've made up my mind about it! I'm going to marry that girl!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nGumshoe:\nUmm... Mr. Edgeworth is pretending he didn't hear you, so I'm gonna ask for him. Have you already asked this girl to marry you?\nButz:\nNo, no. Not yet. But I can tell how she feels by the look in her eyes! She's got this \"I really want this man to carry me over the threshold\" look! I'm sure Nick would be surprised! He'd never imagine that I could marry such a beautiful girl like that!\nEdgeworth:\nSomething tells me he would be shocked, indeed.\nButz:\nThat's why I didn't want her to do anything dangerous. I mean, what am I gonna do if she gets hurt?\nGumshoe:\n... What is this guy trying to say? He lost me about a mile back...\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... If we really want to know the answer to that... (...we're going to have to drag him onto the witness stand.)\n\n\n\n\nThe night of the crime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nCome to think of it, you still haven't answered my question. Where were you and what were you doing last night?\nButz:\nAww, man... Don't you have anything else to talk about? With that kind of attitude, you'll never be a ladies' man like me...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nButz:\nO-OK, OK! Chill out with those scary eyes! I got it! If you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Something incredible\"?\n\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n\nButz:\n...Yeah, yeah. But let's not talk about that now. Let's talk about the good old days. What do you say? Come on, I'll pour you a nice cup of hot water.\nEdgeworth:\n(Why hasn't he realized... ...that I absolutely despise talking about the \"good old days\", especially with him?)\n\n\n\n\nThe night of the crime (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat exactly did you see last night?\nButz:\nWell... It's kinda hard to say...\n\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n\nButz:\nIt's one of those things... Ya know what I mean...? It's like... It's not so much \"what\" I saw, as it's the situation in general... You see what I'm getting at? Whew, that's a relief. Thanks, buddy. Ha ha ha ha ha.\nEdgeworth:\n(I have the strangest urge to smash this guy against those big, nasty locks...)\n\n\n\n\nThe night of the crime (after breaking Psyche-Locks)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo you were here in Heavenly Hall last night, were you not, Larry? And you saw the lightning hit Dusky Bridge, didn't you?\nButz:\nS-Sorry, Edgey...\nGumshoe:\nSorry doesn't cut it, you scumbag! Threatening a young lady like that...\nButz:\n*gulp*... ... Wait, hold up.\nGumshoe:\n...What now, pal?\nButz:\nWhat are you talking about!? What \"threatening\" stuff!?\nGumshoe:\nI'll tell you what! You tried to scare Iris by threatening to expose her secret, pal!\nButz:\nWhat do you mean threaten!? When did I threaten her!?\nGumshoe:\n\"...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed...\" That sure sounds like a threat to me, pal! Blackmail, in fact!\nButz:\nGimme a break! It's a love letter! Haven't you ever been in love!?\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What did you just say!?\nButz:\nMy love for her burns so hotly, it could melt all the snow on this mountain!\nEdgeworth:\nO-Oh? Then what is this secret you mention!?\nButz:\nCome on, Edgey... Don't you get it? I'm talking about the secret love between her and me! Obviously she wouldn't want old lady Bikini to know about it, right...? About our... hot and sour... bittersweet love affair!\nEdgeworth:\n... Alright, then why did you send a love letter in a business-like manila envelope!?\nButz:\nGive me a break! It's not my fault I didn't have any other envelopes! Yeesh!\nGumshoe:\nThen why were you so quick to apologize, pal!?\nButz:\nIt's cuz Edgey gave me that scary look of his!\nEdgeworth:\n... ...\nButz:\nWhat's wrong, Edgey? Why are you so quiet all of a sudden?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's it? THAT'S what all those huge locks were about? (Changed from [That's it? That's all [sic] those huge locks were about?] in the original release) I-I don't understand why you were so defensive...\nButz:\nWell, I dunno either... I guess the thing is... ...you shouldn't expect too much from a guy like me. ...Hey, come on. Don't let it get you down!\nGumshoe:\n... B-But Mr. Edgeworth! This guy is still hiding something! I know it!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nDon't forget what this guy said just a minute ago!\n\n\nButz:\nIf you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible.\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm... He's right!) Larry!\nButz:\nWh-What!? Y-You're looking at me like a hungry dog that just found a bone!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat was this \"something incredible\" you saw last night...? ...You're going to tell me, Larry! One way or another!\n\n\n\n\nSomething incredible (appears after \"The night of the crime\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"I...

You're really upset, aren't you, Edgey? OK, I'll talk!\nEdgeworth:\n...Huh? (That was a bit too easy...)\nButz:\nYeah, anyway! It was awesome! Never seen anything like it! At around 10 o'clock last night, it started thundering. I'd been sleeping... I'm not sure for how long. Suddenly... ZING! The world in front of me went white! Like I'd just been slapped in the face by my old girlfriend, Naomi!\nEdgeworth:\n...And then?\nButz:\nAnd then... It was on fire! The bridge was on fire!\nEdgeworth:\nDusky Bridge caught on fire!? Are you saying you saw it with your own eyes?\nButz:\nHey! Why are you giving me the evil eye!? I'm telling the truth!\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm... There are still three Psycholocks remaining... (Changed from [Hmm... There are still 3 Psycholocks remaining...] in the original release) That means he's still trying to hide something...) By the way, Larry... Where were you when you saw that happen?\nButz:\nWh-Wh-Wh-Where you say? Wh-Wh-What do you mean!?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean, \"What do I mean\"!? ...Just answer the question!\nButz:\nI-I was in my own room... by the Main Hall! Where else would I be!?\nEdgeworth:\nAs usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar. The problem, I suspect, lies there...\nButz:\nTh-Th-Th-Th-There? Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Whaddya mean th-th-there?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's impossible for you to have seen lightning strike Dusky Bridge from your room!\n\n\n\nPresent Hazakura Temple Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This is a map of the area.

Try drinking your hot water. If you don't drink it fast it's going to get cold.\nEdgeworth:\nOh, sorry... (It's cold alright... The water... And my evidence.)\nButz:\nWell? Have you calmed down yet?\nEdgeworth:\nUm, yes... I'm going to think it over again.\nButz:\nH-Hey, I'm telling you... there's nothing to think over! I was in my room doing \"she loves me, she loves me not\" with a bunch of flowers.\nLeads back to:\n\"As usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar.\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis is a map of the area. Take a look around the vicinity of Hazakura Temple.\nButz:\nWh-What am I looking for?\nEdgeworth:\nI think that should be fairly obvious. The Main Hall is surrounded by trees and it's impossible to see the bridge from here.\nButz:\nWhat...!? Why didn't you tell me that before!?\n\n1 LOCK BROKEN\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Well? How about it?\nButz:\nHow about what?\nEdgeworth:\nDo you feel like talking now?\nButz:\nAbout what?\nEdgeworth:\n... (It looks like it won't be that easy after all...) ...You leave me no choice. I'll have to move on to the next step. You weren't in your room at the temple. So then... Where were you?\nButz:\nY-Y-You don't know that I wasn't in my room!\nEdgeworth:\n(So where was Larry, and why was he there...? If I've read the situation up to this point correctly, the answer is fairly obvious.) ...Very well then. Let's test my theory. The place you witnessed lightning striking Dusky Bridge from was... here!\n\n\n\nPresent Heavenly Hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall!\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis is where you were! Well, what do you think, Larry!?\nButz:\nOh... Not much I guess.\nEdgeworth:\n... I'm sorry, but what kind of answer is that?\nButz:\nWell, you were just making small talk, right? Like \"How are you doing?\" or something.\nEdgeworth:\n...Larry. Look at the expression on my face. Do I look like I was just making small talk?\nButz:\nTo be honest? No... I guess not. Ha ha ha ha ha...\nEdgeworth:\n(It appears I didn't think it through carefully enough.)\nLeads back to:\n\"So where was Larry, and why was he there...?\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall!\nButz:\n...Wh-Why would I be hanging out in this old shack? It's freezing cold, there's no electricity, and it could fall apart at any minute...\nEdgeworth:\nLarry... How do you know that anyway? How do you know there's no electricity? After all, it's not that dark yet.\nButz:\nAh... Uh-oh!\nEdgeworth:\nIn other words, you have just provided evidence to prove my theory... My theory that you've at least once in your life visited Heavenly Hall after sunset!\n\n1 LOCK BROKEN\n\nButz:\nI have to admit I'm impressed, Edgey! You're in a totally different league from Nick.\nEdgeworth:\n...That's nice. Now tell me. What were you doing at this cold little shack last night?\nButz:\nThat's what you might call... A \"Fair de Core\".\nEdgeworth:\nI think you mean \"affaire de coeur\". Could it be you were... waiting for someone?\nButz:\nOoooh nooo! Y-You really are one scary guy, you know...\nEdgeworth:\nI believe that last night, you were waiting for this person to come meet you!\n\n\n\nPresent Iris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n \nEdgeworth:\n...Well, Larry!? Was it THIS person...?\nButz:\n...You know what? You should save your finger pointing for the courtroom.\nEdgeworth:\nTsk...!\nButz:\nIt's no wonder people call you a workaholic. You work too hard! You should be like me!\nEdgeworth:\n(Well, I'd rather \"work too hard\" than \"hardly work\" like a loafaholic like you...) In any case... I know you were waiting for someone!\nButz:\nYeah, but... It's like I said. It's an \"affaire de guerre\".\nEdgeworth:\nNo, Larry. You mean \"affaire de coeur\". At least I think you do.\nLeads back to:\n\"Could it be you were... waiting for someone?\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry.\nButz:\nI told you before... Don't call me \"Larry\"...\nEdgeworth:\nThe person you were waiting for was... Iris!\nButz:\nOhh... Suddenly I feel cold all over, Edgey.\nEdgeworth:\nNo doubt because of my chilly glare.\nButz:\nSo you think I got the hots for Sister Iris, huh...? D-Do you have some kind of evidence!? You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing?\nEdgeworth:\n(This is where I draw the line and end this ridiculous little game...)

I-Is it just me?\nEdgeworth:\nNow, I'm the one that suddenly feels cold...\nButz:\nMaybe it's because of my cold laugh?\nEdgeworth:\n(Grr... I hate making such stupid mistakes...)\nButz:\nDo you really have the evidence you say you do, Edgey?\nLeads back to:\n\"You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing?\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Here's your evidence. You called her to this spot with a pathetic blackmail letter!\nButz:\nOh! H-Hey! G-G-Give that back! You're embarrassing me! What are you doing with that anyway!?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's not important! ...I misjudged you, Larry.\nButz:\nWhat do you mean...?\nEdgeworth:\nTaking advantage of a woman's frailty like that! You should be ashamed of yourself!\nButz:\nOhhh... OHHHH!\nEdgeworth:\nFirst of all, what's this at the top of the letter? It says, \"Salutation here\"!\nButz:\nW-Well that's what it said in that book, \"Letter Writing for Dummies\"!\nEdgeworth:\nYou're not supposed to actually write that!

It really wasn't you who killed Ms. Elise Deauxnim, correct?Iris:\n... That is correct. It wasn't me.Edgeworth:\n...Very well, then.Iris:\nUm... Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\n...Yes?Iris:\nYou are a prosecutor... aren't you? Are you sure about this? If your true identity is revealed...Edgeworth:\nDon't worry. I've made the necessary arrangements.

However, the same cannot be said for the prosecution in this case.Edgeworth:\n...Indeed.Judge:\nI'm not sure I like such blatant waste of this court's time. An empty prosecutor's chair can only mean... ...that the prosecutor has no confidence in their ability to prove their case. It would seem this case is already over before it had a chance to begin. I am ready to announce my verdict at this time. This court finds the defendant...???:???:\nThe prosecution... stands ready.Judge:\nA-And you are...?von Karma:\nFranziska von Karma... Prosecuting prodigy.Judge:\nV-Von Karma, you say...? Perchance, you wouldn't be of any relation to the legendary prosecutor Manfred von Karma?von Karma:\n... Legends are a thing of the past. I am a Von Karma. That is all. Upon a special request, I flew in today for the purposes of prosecuting this case.Judge:\nY-You did!? Then... you must be quite a big shot, eh! By the way, Mr. Edgeworth...Edgeworth:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nI'm almost certain that I've seen you somewhere before. Or am I just imagining things? You look very much like a prosecutor I met once...Edgeworth:\n...I believe you are imagining things, Your Honor.Judge:\nMs. von Karma? Do you have anything to say?von Karma:\n... There is no such weakling as this man among those of the Prosecutor's Office.Judge:\nThere... there isn't...? But I'm sure... once before, in this courtroom... Ack!von Karma:\n...I told you, there is no such weakling!Judge:\nWh-What is that!? A whip!? I'm not sure I care for such a thing in my courtroom! B-Bailiff! Remove that whip, at...Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\n...I have no objection to the whip.Judge:\nY-You don't...?Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution can wield a whip or drink seventeen cups of coffee...

I will not allow this chance to crush you slip through my fingers!Edgeworth:\n...I see you brought your flair for the histrionic.Judge:\nAllow me to add to the things I'm not sure about... People acting bizarrely in my court! Uwa-hah!von Karma:\n...The stage is set. Now continue with the proceedings, Your Honor.Judge:\nVery well. Ms. von Karma, please give an outline of this case. With as little whipping as possible!von Karma:\nThe murder victim is the famed picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Her body was found in the Hazakura Temple courtyard. She had been stabbed through the torso by a ceremonial sword from a golden statue.Judge:\nThe sword in this picture... is the weapon in question, correct...? ...Very well. The court accepts this photo of the crime scene.Crime Photo added to the Court Record.von Karma:\nThere is no mistake. This was the doing of Sister Iris. After all... there is a witness to her crime.Judge:\n...Very well. Please bring this witness to the stand!Edgeworth:\n(And so it begins... My first and my last trial... as a defense attorney!)von Karma:\n...Witness. State your name and occupation. Please.Judge:\nH-Hold on here! I'm not sure about being not sure if I care for this at all! Witness! Please stand up nice and straight!Edgeworth:\nIf I recall correctly... ...there are a few milk crates in the Defendant's Lobby for our back pain-plagued witness. (Changed from [...there are a few milk crates in the defendant's lobby for witnesses with bad backs.] in the original release)Judge:\nBailiff! Fetch a crate for this poor lady, please!von Karma:\n...Once again. Your name and occupation, please.Bikini:\nLittle old me? Well, I'm the head nun of Hazakura Temple on Eagle Mountain. My name is Bikini. You got it? Bikini. Nice to meet everyone.Judge:\n... But you don't appear to be wearing a bikini right now... Uwah!von Karma:\n...The courtroom is the garden of holy judgment. Those with lechery in their hearts should leave this sanctuary at once!Judge:\nY-You want me to leave!?Bikini:\nNo need to get your bikinis in a twist! Let me tell you, I'm a sight to behold in summer! Wha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha!Edgeworth:\nIn any case... Witness. I hear that you saw the crime take place on the night in question.Bikini:\nThat's right! I can still hardly believe it myself, to be honest. There's no way dear little Iris could do anything like that...Judge:\nLet us hear what you have to say then. First, tell us aboot your own movements that night, eh!Witness Testimony-- The Night of the Murder --Bikini:\nThat night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But...\nWell, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently.\nSo, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.\nThere's no bath at the Inner Temple, you see, and I needed a long, hot soak.\nIt was after I had finished, just as I was heading back... that's when I saw it!Judge:\nHmm... So it was simply coincidence that you found yourself returning to Hazakura Temple?Bikini:\n...Yes, you could say that. If my back hadn't been in so much pain, I would have stayed at the Inner Temple.Edgeworth:\n(That sounds like a pretty important statement she just made...)von Karma:\nThere is only one problem with this testimony that I can see... And you're not about to fall at the first hurdle, now are you, Miles Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth. ...Please begin your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- The Night of the Murder --Bikini:\nThat night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this Inner Temple...?\nBikini:\nWell, see, conversing with the spirits is what we train people to do, right?\nJudge:\nWe'll be the ones asking you the questions, madam.\nBikini:\n...In order to do that, a place strong in spiritual power is required. There's a small temple across Dusky Bridge, called the Inner Temple.  Acolytes must spend an entire night there to undergo intense training.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd how exactly do you help with this process...?\nBikini:\nIt is all quite exacting. It can't be performed without a nun supervising.\nvon Karma:\nLike a tutor, watching to make sure a spoiled child studies.\nEdgeworth:\n(A tutor with a whip, in your case.) If that is the case... ...then why did you return to Hazakura Temple, where the murder took place?Bikini:\nWell, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nViolently...?\nBikini:\nThat's right. It's no laughing matter, especially in winter! I can't hold anything heavier than a knife and fork during the cold months! Just being alive is like strict training! Wah ha ha! Wha ha! Wah ha ha!\nEdgeworth:\nOn the night of the murder, was this fabulous back of yours hurting again...?\nBikini:\nThat's right. Raging like a bull in a pigpen. I almost fainted once or twice! I just knew that unless I warmed it up, it was going to finally finish me off!Bikini:\nSo, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou \"left Iris to help\"... With what?\nBikini:\nWhat do you think? The acolyte's training, of course. It was just past 10 PM, so we were starting to enter into the training exercises proper.\nJudge:\nWasn't it your place to remain with the disciple?\nBikini:\nWell, the job is simply to watch over the acolyte so that they don't pass away.\nEdgeworth:\nJust to confirm this point again, that night... ...you met Iris in the Inner Temple, correct?\nBikini:\nYes, yes. She's a gentle, honest girl. She's never once failed to follow my directions.Present Iris's Testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Witnesses have to undergo their own trials, I'm afraid. The defendant's fate rests on their powers of observation and memory, after all.\nBikini:\nWell, well, well. Don't worry! I'm more than up to the task! I'm a woman of faith, after all. The head honcho of Hazakura Temple.\nEdgeworth:\nIn that case, Ms. Honcho... I'd like you to explain something for me. The discrepancy between your testimony and that of the defendant, Iris. She claims that after ringing the lights out bell, she went back and stayed in her room. ...Which means! She did not go to the Inner Temple at all!\nBikini:\nN... No...! She said that...?\nvon Karma:\n\nvon Karma:\nA defendant or a witness... Who is more likely to lie, do you suppose? The defendant is simply lying to cover her back!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nBut that is completely illogical. The murder was committed in the courtyard of Hazakura Temple. Claiming that she \"went to the Inner Temple\" would make for a much better alibi.\nvon Karma:\n...!\nBikini:\nBut that is odd... Whatever the reason... I can't believe that she would lie...!\nJudge:\nHmm... she does indeed have honest eyes! Uwaaaah!\nvon Karma:\n...All people lie. That is my belief.\nJudge:\nWhy am I the only one being whipped in here...!? Anyway! Neither the witness nor the defendant have any reason to lie! Which means... We must call your memory into question...\nBikini:\nDear, dear, dear. You're older than me and yet you want to play that game, do you?\nJudge:\nA-Ah, well, that isn't exactly what I...\nBikini:\nMy memory is perfect! Crystal clear! Especially in winter!\nJudge:\nThen... I suppose it's too early to end this cross-examination, eh. Mr. Edgeworth. If you are going to question the memory of this witness... ...you will need to show me a more decisive piece of evidence.\nEdgeworth:\n...Understood, Your Honor. (I was naïve to think that alone would do the trick.)\nJudge:\nThen please add your comments aboot Iris to the testimony... And let us return to the cross-examination.\nChanges statement from \"So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.\" to \"Iris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner.\"Bikini:\nIris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nAre you sure that you're not making a mistake...?\nBikini:\n...You, young man, need to get your estimation of me up from the floor!\nEdgeworth:\nNngh...!\nBikini:\nIris always wears the same clothes. The smallest thing out of place would have stood out like a sore thumb to me! You're making a mistake, thinking I made a mistake!\nJudge:\n...An excellent finish there, witness.\nEdgeworth:\n(Still, I have to wonder...)Present Iris's Hood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...Witness. Let's get one thing straight.\"Bikini:\nThere's no bath at the Inner Temple, you see, and I needed a long, hot soak.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...So you returned to the Hazakura Temple in order to take a bath?\nBikini:\nMy back is to blame for everything. It's a \"do or be done in\" kind of world, after all.\nEdgeworth:\nHow long were you in the bath for, if you don't mind me asking?\nBikini:\n... My my my, what a filthy little rogue you are! I know what's on your mind!\nEdgeworth:\n...?\nBikini:\nI bet your next question is going to be, \"Where exactly did you wash?\" Ah, THIS is why you have to watch the young ones...\nEdgeworth:\nW-What are you going on about!? I was... Gwah!\nvon Karma:\n...Pathetic, Miles Edgeworth.\nJudge:\nThe lowest of the low.\nEdgeworth:\n(Is there some sort of \"Kick Me\" sign stuck to the defense's bench!?)\nBikini:\nAnyway, I couldn't afford to be away from my post for too long, you understand, so...Bikini:\nIt was after I had finished, just as I was heading back... that's when I saw it!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe crime took place in the courtyard, correct...?\nBikini:\nWhen you go from my room to the Main Hall... ...you have to take a winding hallway from which you can see the courtyard.\nvon Karma:\nThat's right. In other words... ...it was pure coincidence that the witness saw the crime taking place before her eyes. There was no complicated set-up in this case!\nJudge:\nHmm... That certainly seems to be true.Edgeworth:\n(There is indeed only one problem with this testimony. If I can clearly point out what it is, then I can begin to quantify... ...just how good this witness's memory and observation skills are.)Edgeworth:\n...Witness. Let's get one thing straight. The defendant whom you claim to have met... ...she was wearing this \"Demon-Warding Hood\", correct?Bikini:\nOf course! That is a very important piece of clothing, I'll have you know! Wha ha ha! Wha ha ha! Ha ha... Wait a minute...von Karma:von Karma:\nH-Hold it right there! Why do you have that...!?Edgeworth:\nThat's the question of the day, now isn't it... Ms. von Karma? I'll have you know that this hood was given to someone as a gift that night. Before the lights out bell was rung.von Karma:\nW... What!?Edgeworth:\n...You know where I'm going with this, don't you? If the witness had seen the defendant as she claims... ...then the Iris she saw should have been missing this very hood! (Changed from [...the defendant couldn't have been wearing this very hood!] in the original release)Bikini:\nWell well well!Edgeworth:\n(It's not a bad feeling at all, exposing contradictions like this... Now I understand that happy look on Wright's face every time he does it...)Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Witness, your response... Wuahaaa!von Karma:\n...Sister. This hood... You have spare ones around the temple, don't you?Bikini:\nSpares... Well... I do tend to make too many of them.Judge:\nI see... A stockpile. A surplus of hoods, eh?Bikini:\nEach nun is only given one hood. This should be the only hood that Iris owned...Judge:\nHmm... Then this is quite strange! Waaaah!von Karma:\nIf there was a surplus of hoods, then she could have worn one of those! ...There is no contradiction here!Judge:\nHmm...Edgeworth:\n(I'm sorry to break this to you, Ms. von Karma... but you won't get away that easily. Discrepancies such as this will sow seeds in any human heart. The seeds of doubt.)Judge:\n...Witness. While I don't wish to call your testimony into doubt... ...you must give every detail with precision.Bikini:\nI-I'm not sure I'm comfortable going along with this...von Karma:\nSister. You shall continue with your testimony. Tell us what you saw after finishing your bath, on your way back to the Inner Temple!Edgeworth:\n(Those seeds of doubt are sprouting in the judge's heart. They just need a little more stimulation to bear fruit... Contradictory stimulation.)Witness Testimony-- After My Bath --Bikini:\nI finished my bath around 11, and I thought I should return to the Inner Temple.\nAnd as I was walking back... I heard a noise from the courtyard. I took a look and...\nIris was...! Oh, Mystic Elise! And with that sword, of all things!\nMystic Elise was staying in the corner room, which faces out onto the courtyard.\nThe stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window.Judge:\nYou saw a truly terrible sight, didn't you...? If I was in your place... ...then it would be much like Ms. von Karma whipping Mr. Edgeworth in two in court! And me, seeing it all from this very chair! ...Er, well, something like that.Edgeworth:\n(This judge... His imagination is about as vivid and creative as Detective Gumshoe...)von Karma:\nI would look the fool if I commented on such foolishness. Anyway, this case is mine... Miles Edgeworth!Edgeworth:\nCalling everyone by their full name... Can't you do something about that habit of yours?Cross Examination-- After My Bath --Bikini:\nI finished my bath around 11, and I thought I should return to the Inner Temple.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...How far is it from your room to the Inner Temple?\nBikini:\nLet me think a moment... About twenty minutes, on these stumps of mine. It's about 15 minutes to Dusky Bridge from Hazakura Temple. The Inner Temple is just beyond the bridge.\nvon Karma:\nStill, you never made it back there that night, did you?\nBikini:\nT-That's right... I was heading along the walkway toward the Main Hall...Bikini:\nAnd as I was walking back... I heard a noise from the courtyard. I took a look and...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou say you heard a noise...?\nBikini:\n\"Thump\"... Just like that.\nvon Karma:\n...That could only be the sound of the victim falling.\nBikini:\nIt's very quiet in the temple, you know. You can even hear the snow falling from the branches. \"Thump\"... Just like that.\nJudge:\nBut then, couldn't this noise you heard have been snow falling to the ground?\nBikini:\n... I never thought of that. Wah ha ha. Wha ha ha. Ha ha...\nJudge:\nHoh hoh. Hoh hoh. Hoh hoh... Uaaaaaah!\nvon Karma:\nThe next one to laugh gets a whipping!\nBikini:\nWell. Whatever the source of the sound, I looked over at the courtyard and...Bikini:\nIris was...! Oh, Mystic Elise! And with that sword, of all things!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...This is the second time that the witness has testified to seeing the defendant. But... some doubt remains in these claims.\nBikini:\nHey, just what does that mean!? Just because you're a good-looking young man doesn't give you the right to...\nEdgeworth:\nThe murderer who stabbed the victim with the sword... Sister Bikini, try to recall exactly who it was you saw! As clearly as you can!\nBikini:\nHmm... Well. You're a handsome young man, so I'll forgive you. ... Oh! Now that you mention it... There was something awfully strange about her... Something that has been bugging me all this time!\nEdgeworth:\n...Please, don't keep us in suspense.\nBikini:\nHer hood!\nvon Karma:\nHer hood...?\nBikini:\nThat's right! ...It's coming back to me... Iris... She wasn't wearing her hood! I thought something was out of place, but... It all makes sense now, doesn't it? After all, she'd given that hood away to someone, right?\nEdgeworth:\n...Urk!\nvon Karma:\nHah... You've dug your own grave, Miles Edgeworth!\nJudge:\nWhat do you say, Mr. Edgeworth? Is this testimony important?\n\n\n\nIt's not important\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(...This line of questioning is only going to tear the  wound open further.) These statements are as useless as the investigations of a certain detective. ...There is no need to record them.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nJudge:\nVery well. ...Please, continue with your testimony.\nvon Karma:\nHmph...\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nIt's important\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(This may initially appear to put me at a disadvantage... But, I can't see any other leads at the moment...) ...Your Honor. I would like these new statements to be added to the testimony.\nvon Karma:\nHeh... Miles Edgeworth.\nvon Karma:\nIf you want to hang yourself, you need only to ask. I'll gladly lend you my whip!\nJudge:\nWitness. Add that statement to your testimony.\nBikini:\n...No problem.\nAdds statement \"Now that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on.\"Bikini:\nNow that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou are sure about that...?\nBikini:\nYes. After all, we always wear the same clothes. Ah! I don't mean because we're poor, you understand? It's our style. Yes, that's it!\nEdgeworth:\n...There's absolutely no need to explain yourself.\nBikini:\nAnyway! She looked different from normal, so that really stuck out.\nvon Karma:\nLike me holding a whippet puppy instead of my whip.\nEdgeworth:\n(At least then it might bite you and not someone else...)\nBikini:\nIris didn't have her hood on. I'm sure of it!\nJudge:\n...Very well. Now, please tell us aboot the victim, eh.Bikini:\nMystic Elise was staying in the corner room, which faces out onto the courtyard.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe room the victim was staying in overlooked the courtyard, correct?\nJudge:\nWhich means... the victim's room was on the second floor?\nBikini:\nNo, no. Hazakura Temple is a single story building. But the mountain itself slopes downward... ...which elevates the Main Gate side of the temple and the guest rooms in the back... ...to about the height of a two story building.\nJudge:\nI see... And the victim was staying in one of these elevated rooms, correct?\nBikini:\nYes... I should know. I'm the one who carried her things to her room, after all...Bikini:\nThe stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat makes you so sure of all this...?\nBikini:\nIt's just like I told you earlier... \"I heard a noise from the courtyard.\" OK? \"Thump\"... Just like that.\nvon Karma:\nYou're one smart sister, I'll give you that. The autopsy report states that... ...the victim's body was covered in bruises... ...indicating a fall from around 10 feet in height.\nJudge:\nHmm... It appears that the witness was not mistaken then.\nBikini:\nYep. Yep. I'm more than just a pretty face. Especially in winter! I'm a woman of faith, after all. The head honcho of Hazakura Temple.\nEdgeworth:\n(There's only two of them working there...!)\nvon Karma:\nWhat's wrong, Miles Edgeworth? No snappy comeback remark?\nEdgeworth:\n...Present Elise's Autopsy Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...Impressive logic. That's what I'd like to say, anyway.\"Edgeworth:\n(...It doesn't feel like she is lying. This is very powerful testimony, too. She claims to have seen the instant in which the defendant stabbed the victim... There are only two things I can believe in right now... My client, Iris, and my own abilities as a defense attorney.)Edgeworth:\n...Impressive logic. That's what I'd like to say, anyway.Bikini:\nOh please, do! My brain is something else... especially in winter!Edgeworth:\nHowever... I think you are overlooking one thing. ...Ms. von Karma. Would you be so kind as to take another look at the autopsy report?von Karma:\nT-The autopsy report...?Edgeworth:\nThe victim did fall from a height of 10 feet. ...However. This fall... was after she was killed.von Karma:\nAh...!Judge:\nT-That's right! It says \"after death\" right here!Edgeworth:\nThe scene the witness claims to have seen is contradictory! If the defendant stabbed and killed the victim there in the courtyard... ...how did the victim then go on to take a ten foot fall!?von Karma:\nAaah!Judge:\nO-Order! Order! The victim was killed and then fell! If that is the case... ...then the victim must have been killed in her room... Don't you agree?von Karma:\nTh-That is the logical conclusion... Yes, that's right! The victim must have been stabbed by the defendant in her own room! And she was then thrown out of her window down into the courtyard below!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nWere there any signs of a struggle in Ms. Deauxnim's room...?von Karma:\n...!Edgeworth:\nShe was stabbed with a sword! That would leave a blood stain, wouldn't you agree?Judge:\nW-Well, Ms. von Karma? Was there any blood...? Waaaaaah!von Karma:\n...No traces of blood were found in the victim's room.Judge:\n...Your whip has just caused traces of blood to be found on my glorious playoff beard. However! If there was no blood in the room, then your claim that... Waaaaah!von Karma:\nI'm sure there's no need for me to go over this... ...as I'm sure Your Honor is well aware... ...of when a stab wound produces the most blood.Judge:\nWhen it produces the most blood...?von Karma:\nVery little blood is actually lost at the moment of a blade's insertion. If you want to talk about when the most blood would be lost from a body... ...that would be when the blade is removed.Edgeworth:\nIndeed. With the weapon still in place... ...it acts like a lid on the wound.Judge:\nThat's true... With the weapon still in the body, there wouldn't be much bleeding... A perfectly reasonable line of thinking!von Karma:\nWe have come to a conclusion then! The victim was thrown out of the window with the sword still in place... This removes all of the contradictions!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! I must admit that this is a probable version of events!Edgeworth:\n(I'd expect no less from Franziska von Karma... She locates and takes control of every vital point!)von Karma:\n...Hmph...Judge:\nIt seems... ...that we need a clearer testimony from the witness. Remove all supposition on your part and tell us only the truth, please! Witness! Please! Remain standing on the crate!Bikini:\nDon't go selling me short now! The weight of winter snow has bent me out of shape! ...Especially my back and my mood!von Karma:\nSister. Please, give us your testimony. I will give you a vigorous massage once we are finished here.Edgeworth:\n(...With the whip?)Bikini:\n...Oh, boy. Alright, alright...Witness Testimony-- Further Details --Bikini:\nWhen I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place.\nThinking about it now, I didn't actually see her stab Mystic Elise.\nI've never seen so much blood before...\nThat's when I fainted. You can't blame me, can you?\nAnd when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back!Judge:\nHmm... This all confirms Ms. von Karma's theory...von Karma:\nVon Karmas strive for nothing but perfection. Putting together such facts is nothing for me! You should know that, Miles Edgeworth!Edgeworth:\n(\"Perfection\" is an impossibility, Franziska von Karma... And I'm here to teach you just that...)Cross Examination",

Law OfficesMaya:\nHey, Nick.Phoenix:\nYeah? What is it?Maya:\nYou know how I've got spiritual powers, unlike you?Phoenix:\nUm, sure... You are a spirit medium, after all.Maya:\nBut just like you, if I don't keep my powers sharp, they get dull, right?Phoenix:\nUm... I guess so, yeah.Maya:\nGlad you agree! OK, Pearly! You're up!Phoenix:\n(Pearls...?)Pearl:\nSo! That's why we need to go on a special \"Spiritual Hot Spot Tour\", Mr. Nick!Phoenix:\n...Huh? I'm lost. What's this magazine you're shoving in my face?Pearl:\nIt's the New Year's issue of \"Oh! Cult!\", Winter Spiritual Locations Special!Phoenix:\n...Oh. (Pearls looks so happy.)Maya:\n\"Maximize your spiritual powers with just one night of intensive training!\" ...Oh! It sounds too good to be true!Phoenix:\nI'll say. It sounds more like a scam to me.Maya:\nIt's at a spiritual retreat called \"Hazakura Temple\". It's way up in the mountains, and I bet it's nice and cold. ...Just perfect for training!Phoenix:\n(Now I definitely don't want to go...)Maya:\nYou know, I think I've heard of this temple before. It's a famous channeling dojo. It's hard for even real spirit mediums like us to make reservations up there!Phoenix:\nReservations...? For a temple? Are you serious?Pearl:\nDon't worry! I've already made special reservations, just for us!Maya:\nYeah! And I signed up for the \"Special Course\"!Phoenix:\nTh-That's nice. And the timing couldn't be better. ...Since we don't have a case right now anyway.Maya:\nAlrighty then! It's settled! Well, come on! Don't just stand there! Start packing your stuff!Pearl:\nYes, Mr. Nick! You'd better start packing your stuff!Phoenix:\nHuh...? M-ME!? Why do I have to go!?Maya:\nWell, we have to be accompanied by someone over 20 years old.Phoenix:\nHey! I don't have anything to do with spirit power. The only thing I can channel is a TV. ... So, um, is there a heated pool at this \"Hazakura Temple\"?Pearl:\nNo, but you can stand under a freezing waterfall!Phoenix:\n... Sorry, but I think I'll pass. I hate cold places.Maya:\nWhaaat!? No way! How can you be so selfish!?Pearl:\nCome on, Mr. Nick! Look at this place! Doesn't it look beautiful!?Phoenix:\nNope. Not going. I'm gonna be nice and toasty at home....... .................What the...!?Pearl:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Nick?Phoenix:\nLet me see that magazine! Th-This nun...Maya:\nIs she a friend of yours or something, Nick?Phoenix:\n(Th-This girl... I-It's...!)Dahlia:\nMy name is Dahlia Hawthorne. I just want to say... It's an honor for me to be here in your noble presence.Dahlia:\nHonestly, how can any woman ever count on you for anything? ...You disgust me!Phoenix:\nBut... It can't be! (She was found guilty and should still be in prison...)Pearl:\n...Mr. Nick?Phoenix:\n... I'll go.Maya:\nHuh...?Phoenix:\nHazakura Temple... I said I'll go.Maya:\nYay! Isn't that great, Pearly!?Pearl:\nYes! Oh, thank you! Thank you, Mr. Nick! You'd do anything for Mystic Maya, right? Even walk over burning coals, right!?\"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue received from Pearls.Phoenix:\n(Dahlia Hawthorne... I knew there was no way she could possibly be at that temple... But, I just had to be see for myself... ...who this \"nun\" really was.)February 7, 3:24 PMHazakura TempleMain GateMaya:\nBrrrrr... It-It-It's so c-c-cold here, Nick!Phoenix:\nMaybe you should put on something warmer for a change!Maya:\nW-W-Well, it's supposed to be c-c-cold... It's t-t-training. ...Ah-Achoo!Phoenix:\n(Her teeth are chattering so loudly, it's all I can do to make out what she's saying...)Pearl:\nWow, Mystic Maya! So this is the famous Hazakura Temple!Maya:\nP-P-P-Pearly... I-I-I-I... Ah-Achoo!???:\nWell, well, well... How nice to see you here. Welcome to our temple!Maya:\nOh...! Th-Th-Thank you... Ah-Achoo!???:\nOh my, my, my... Thank you for coming all this way. Come now, come now. You must have been cold.Phoenix:\nWhat's with the past tense...? We're freezing into human popsicles as we spea--!???:\nHo ho ho. Well, we are high up in the mountains after all. In any case, we shouldn't speak here. ...Please follow me inside.Maya:\nTh-Thank you. I was starting to think I would pass--???:\nOh! Yes, yes! I almost forgot to introduce myself.Bikini:\nI'm the head nun here at the temple. My name is Bikini.Maya:\nB-B-B-Bikini...!?Bikini:\nThat's riiight! Actually, that's my \"temple\" name. What do you think? It's a tradition to have one, and I wanted something that has a nice image to it. So I thought, \"Why not choose a bikini?\" Besides, it makes me seem younger. Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho!Maya:\nIt certainly does! Oh, I signed up for your \"Special Course\"!Bikini:\nWell, my, my, my. Quite brave of you considering how cold it is! Young people can be so reckless with their health! Don't blame me if you become one with those you channel. Wa ha ha! Ho ho ho!Pearl:\nR-Reckless...?Maya:\n\"Wa ha ha\"...?Pearl:\nMaybe you should take it easy tonight, Mystic Maya... We can come back another day.Maya:\nBut you went through all that trouble to get reservations for m--Bikini:\nYes, yes, yes, that's right! You've come all this way, so please, enjoy yourselves! There's still time before supper, so why don't you have a look around?Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nWhat do you think, Nick? Pretty awesome gate, huh?\nPhoenix:\nIt sure is... It looks pretty well maintained, too. This thing kinda puts your hometown to shame, Maya.\nMaya:\nYeah... Well, a lot of things have happened in Kurain Village. We used to be a lot richer, back when people hired us to perform channelings.\nPhoenix:\nOh, I see... But now the place looks a bit run down...\nMaya:\nHmm... I guess I was just born in the wrong time.\n\n\n\n\nMain Hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nThat looks like the Main Hall where we'll be staying tonight. From here, it looks like one of those ice hotels you always hear about!\nPhoenix:\n...They gotta have a heater or something in there, don't you think? I don't wanna die.\nMaya:\nI'm not worried, I brought my hot-water bottle.\nPhoenix:\nDid you bring one for me?\nMaya:\nWhat are you talking about, Nick? Who carries around 2 hot-water bottles?\nPhoenix:\n(Brr! If the cold doesn't kill me, the ice queen over here will finish the job...)\n\n\n\n\nBell tower\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nOh, look! It's a cute little bell tower! I absolutely love the sound of a giant bell!\nPhoenix:\nOh? So, which do you like better? That or the sound of money?\nMaya:\n...! ...... Sorry, but I'll take money for the win, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What are you apologizing for?\n\n\n\n\nSnowmobile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nOh look, it's one of those snow motorcycle things!\nPhoenix:\nMost people call that a \"snowmobile\", you know.\nMaya:\n\"Snow motorcycle things\", \"Snowblowmeal\". Same thing. Hmm... Too bad we didn't invite Desirée. I bet she could race like the wind on this \"Slowmobile\"! Or maybe she'd give me ride on this \"Blowsnowbile\".\nPhoenix:\nArgh! I told you, it's \"snowmobile\"!Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanneling dojo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUmm... So what's a \"channeling dojo\" anyway?\nBikini:\nOh my, my, my... You don't even know that?\nMaya:\nForgive him, Sister, for he knows not what he is saying.\nBikini:\nWell, well, well. Just call me Bikini and forget that \"Sister\" part. A channeling dojo is basically a spiritual power training ground. We have special holy items prepared here to help people boost their spiritual power.\nPhoenix:\nH-Holy items...?\nBikini:\nIf you train an entire evening surrounded by these items... Aaah. It's quite mysterious. The spiritual power of these items seems to envelop you. Wa ha ha ha.\nPhoenix:\n(Wow, she must have just gotten off the trolley from the land of make-believe...)\nMaya:\nUm, so what exactly is the \"Special Course\"...?\nBikini:\nYou must be incredibly devoted to be interested in that at such a young age! It's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant a spell... ...30,000 times! All while being showered in freezing cold spirit water.\nMaya:\nEh...?\nBikini:\nIt's February now, right? You have to be careful this time of the year... If you don't watch it, you'll catch pneumonia or maybe even die of hypothermia... So be careful, you hear? Wa ha ha. Ho ho ho. Ha!\nMaya:\nHow am I supposed to \"be careful\"...?\nPearl:\nOh no... I knew I shouldn't have signed Mystic Maya up for this...\n\n\n\n\nThe other nun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUmm, Sister... About this picture...\nBikini:\nWell, well. Look at that. I must say I look rather divine here, don't you think?\nPhoenix:\nOh, um, yeah. Unforgettable in every way.\nBikini:\nYou mean it? Oh, I knew it! Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho ho! The makeup was pretty tough, but Iris helped me out.\nMaya:\n\"Iris\"...?\nBikini:\nThe cute little girl in the photo. She looks just like me, doesn't she? We're just a small temple here, so she and I run the entire place.\nMaya:\nReally? That kinda sounds like fu--\nPhoenix:\nSorry to cut in, but...! This \"Iris\"... Where is she right now?\nBikini:\nOh! Just listen to you! You haven't come all the way up here just to find a girlfriend, have you?\nPearl:\n... *glare*\nPhoenix:\nNo, no, no! Th-That's not what I had in mind at all...\nBikini:\nAnyway, Iris is in the Inner Temple preparing for this evening.\nMaya:\nInner Temple...?\nBikini:\nYes, yes, that's right. Iris will be back this evening. Why don't you go have a look at the Main Hall for now? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha.\nPhoenix:\n(So she's in the Inner Temple, huh...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm, do you think you could take a look at this?\nBikini:\nI may not look like it, but I can tell you I'm very much in demand. And to be quite honest, I'm finding this a little difficult to say...\nPearl:\n...What IS she trying to say, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI think she's trying to say that she's busy.\nMaya:\nBut seriously Nick, what's the deal? Nothing has even happened yet and you're already shoving evidence into people's faces. You need to forget about work and relax a little.\nPearl:\nTry to have some fun, OK Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, you're right... (Sure. Pin the hypothermia on the lawyer is great fun!)February 7Hazakura TempleMain HallMaya:\nBrr... It's fr-freezing in here, too! Achoo!Pearl:\nHee hee. It reminds me of the Meditation Room in Fey Manor!Phoenix:\n...Pearls, you've been in an unusually good mood since we got here.Pearl:\nWell, kids are made of energy, you know!Phoenix:\nAs for you, Maya, you look like you're about to catch a bad cold.Maya:\nW-W-Well, I'm not exactly a little kid anymore, I guess. Ah-Achoo!Phoenix:\n(Nngh... Is she going to make it...?)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSliding doors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI bet the writing on these sliding doors are instructions for spirit channeling... Kinda like how we scribbled math formulas on the bathroom walls to remember them. Except we couldn't go to the bathroom during tests... And I can't read these walls.\n\n\n\n\nObjects on floor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere are straw zabuton cushions arranged around a hibachi brazier... I haven't seen a layout like this since I saw this really old Japanese movie on TV. ...If it wasn't for this hibachi, they'd probably freeze to death.\n\n\n\n\nAltar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's an altar. It looks a bit old, but someone does a good job taking care of it. Speaking of altars, I remember seeing one like this in Kurain Village last year. I guess they really do have something to do with spiritual power after all.\n\n\n\n\nMagatama on altar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere's a laughably large Magatama on the altar.

Maya told me this type of zabuton is called \"enza\"... I suppose if I'd never come here, I'd have missed out on all these new things.February 7Suspension BridgeMaya:\nWow! Look at this broken down old bridge, Nick!Phoenix:\nY-Yeah, and look at that big canyon below us.Maya:\nHey! There's a river down there! It looks like it's flowing real fast! ...What's wrong, Nick? You look like you've seen a ghost!Phoenix:\nI-I'm just not very good with heights...Maya:\nOh... Hey! I've got it! Maybe you should face your fear and try hurling yourself off the edge? You know! One... Two... Three... Jump! It might be just what you need to get over your fear of heights!Phoenix:\n...Yeah, death is a real good way to overcome phobias alright. Anyway, it sure looks like a rickety bridge.Maya:\nCan't argue there. That's probably why it's called, \"Dusty Bridge\".Phoenix:\nRead it again, Maya. It says, \"Dusky Bridge\".Maya:\nWell, it's practically the same thing.Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCliff on opposite side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like it's about 20 yards to that cliff over there.\nMaya:\nI guess that's where I'll be training tonight. Do you want to train with me, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nAnd do the Special Course? I think not.\nMaya:\nBut it'd be so great if you had spiritual powers, too! (Really? \"I see dead people\" sounds more like a cause for alarm to me...)\n\n\n\n\nWooden sign on left side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere's a narrow path going off in a different direction than that of the Main Hall.\nMaya:\nThe sign here is so old, the text seems to have vanished.\nPhoenix:\nThe path leads to a wooden staircase that goes down to the bottom of the canyon.\nMaya:\nOK, I'll write, \"wooden staircase\" on it then.\nPhoenix:\n...Do you really think that is necessary? You'd have to be blind not to see the stairs.\nMaya:\nWell, it can't hurt. Just pass me a pencil, OK?\nPhoenix:\nGraffiti is a crime, Maya.\n\n\n\n\nBridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! Why don't we hop across the bridge. It'll be fun!\nPhoenix:\nI'm not so sure... It looks like a bunny hopping across the bridge would destroy it.\nMaya:\nOK, Nick. Then let's try to find a cute little white bunny and test your theory.\nPhoenix:\n(That right there sums up the fundamental difference between sane and insane.)\n\n\n\n\nBoulder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSome letters are engraved into a roughly cut boulder.\nMaya:\n\"D-U-S-T-Y Bridge\", huh?\nPhoenix:\nIt says, \"Dusky\"! \"Dusky Bridge\"! OK?\nMaya:\nC'mon, Nick! Take a look at that bridge and tell me it's not supposed to be \"Dusty\"! This sign is obviously wrong, and I'm gonna fix it! Now give me a pencil, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nDo I look like a pencil holder to you?\n\n\n\n\nPublic phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nI can't believe there's a public phone here. Who would ever use it?\nPhoenix:\nThe people who live here, I guess. I doubt they have any real phones there.\nMaya:\nYeah, but it took like 20 minutes to walk here from the Main Hall! ... It would've been smarter of them to build the Main Hall here, don't you think?\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe you should work on channeling someone who makes logical sense, Maya.After clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate:February 7Hazakura TempleMain HallMaya:\nTh-Th-The Main Hall...

Yum!Phoenix:\n...Weird. I thought they would serve something a little more... well, traditional.Maya:\nWhat are you talking about, Nick!? You think monks and nuns just sit around eating rice gruel all the time!?Pearl:\nMystic Maya is right! Ooh! I hope there's mashed potatoes, too! I love mashed potatoes!???:\nHa ha ha...

And please, call me Elise.Phoenix:\nUm, \"books\"...?Pearl:\nMr. Nick, don't you know anything!? Don't you even know who this is?Phoenix:\nWell, um... ...An author, maybe?Elise:\nYes, and an illustrator. ...Of picture books.Maya:\nPicture books, huh? Oh, now I get it...Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElise Deauxnim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... I'm sorry I didn't know who you are. I don't get a lot of chances to really enjoy picture books.\nElise:\nIt's alright. I take no offense to that. My books are nothing but simple stories for children.\nPearl:\nAnd really beautiful pictures too, Ms. Elise! Your books always make me feel as if my heart has been purified.\nElise:\nHa ha ha... It makes me feel very happy to hear you say that.\nPhoenix:\n(I do have to admit... She certainly seems like a kind, sensitive lady.)\nPearl:\nMs. Elise won an award last year for her book, \"The Magic Bottle\"!\nElise:\nYes... A friend of mine secretly submitted a story I had written to a publisher. They liked it so much that they asked if it was alright to make it into a book.\nPhoenix:\nWow... It must have been a really great story.\nMaya:\n...Maybe I should try to write a children's book, too. If I do, you can secretly send it to a publisher for me, Nick.\nElise:\nRecently, I've accepted a sort of... apprentice you might say.\nPhoenix:\nAn apprentice?\nElise:\nHe calls himself Laurice... Laurice Deauxnim. I believe he's off doing some landscape sketches now... On Laurice's behalf as well, I'd like to thank you for your support.\nPearl:\nOf course, Ms. Elise! Anything for you!\nElise:\nHa ha ha...\n\n\n\n\nWhy come here?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPearl:\nUm... Why did you come to Hazakura Temple, Ms. Elise? Are you here... to do some spiritual training?\nElise:\nHa ha ha... No, that's not it. I'm actually here to gather materials for a new book I'm working on.\nPearl:\nWow! I-I can't wait to read it!\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls is completely taken with her...)\nElise:\nI wanted to do a book with a more Japanese feel to it this time.\nPhoenix:\n...So is that why you're dressed like you are?\nElise:\nThe children have a certain image of me in their minds. I don't want to disappoint them...\nPhoenix:\n(What can I say... She's really a sweet lady...)\nPearl:\nWow, Ms. Elise, you're dressed up like a mountain nun!\nElise:\nYes. The good people here were kind enough to let me borrow this... I'm wearing training clothes underneath my robe, as well.\nMaya:\n...I want a staff like that.\nElise:\nYou like the crystal sphere? It's real amethyst, you know.\nMaya:\nMaybe we'll find one like that up here on this mountain. Good luck, Nick! I know you'll find me one!Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMs. Deauxnim? What do you think about this?\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Do you think Ms. Elise is a suspect?\nPhoenix:\nHuh...?\nPearl:\nYou may be Mystic Maya's special someone, but I won't let you do this to Ms. Elise!\nPhoenix:\n(A suspect? Why would I suspect her of anything? It's not like anything's happened.)\nMaya:\nIsn't it cute, Nick? Pearly's getting all overprotective of her new friend.After clearing all Talk options:Elise:\nWell, you'll have to excuse me now... I have to go help with the dinner preparations.Pearl:\nWow! You mean you're cooking dinner tonight?Elise:\nThat's right. Would you like to help too, Pearl?Pearl:\nYes, yes! I want to help with whatever I can!Phoenix:\n(Pearls looks like she just won the lottery...)Maya:\nOh, I'll help too, then...Elise:\n...No, it's fine. Please don't worry about it. Feel free to relax and explore the area with your friend.Maya:\nHuh!? But...Elise:\n...Oh, yes! Please take this. I think it will be of help to you. It's a map of the area. We wouldn't want you to get lost now, would we?Phoenix:\n(The \"Inner Temple\"... There it is, on the other side of the bridge...) Well, if you insist, I guess we'll take this chance to go check out the other temple.Hazakura Temple Map added to the Court Record.Pearl:\nOK! I'll see you two later then! Remember!

Where did Sister Bikini go?Phoenix:\nI guess she went to the Inner Temple... To go help that other nun out.Maya:\nOh, right... I think her name is... Iris?Phoenix:\nY-Yeah... That was it.

Your face is all green.Phoenix:\nC-Can you not pick on me for a second? I'm still trying to get over the shock that we made it safely across that death trap.Maya:\nYeah, I guess I'm a bit surprised, too... Yikes! That \"temple\" is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse at any time... (Changed from [Yikes! That 'temple' is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse anytime...] in the original release)Phoenix:\nI guess people don't use it too often. Is this really where you're going to train tonight?Maya:\nThat has to be it. It's kinda creepy around here... Like a ghost might jump out at you or something!Phoenix:\n(A spirit medium afraid of ghosts...? Isn't it ironic, don't you think?)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI don't care how much you pay me, I don't want to cross that bridge again.\nMaya:\nNo worries, Nick. No one is offering you any money.\nPhoenix:\nThat's because no reasonable person would call that pile of popsicle sticks a bridge! The latter half of it was nothing more than a few planks of wood and some string!\nMaya:\nHey, if we want to get back, we've got no choice but to cross it again, you know.\nPhoenix:\n... Maybe I'll just stay... I've always dreamed of living in a little shack in the woods.\nMaya:\n...Wow, you really are scared, aren't you?\n\n\n\n\nSuspension wire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nIt looks like this bridge is suspended by 4 of these wires.\nPhoenix:\n...They're reeeally thin. Shouldn't they be just a little thicker...?\nMaya:\nOh, stop it! You're such a worrywart, Nick! If the bridge were really going to collapse... ...I'm pretty sure the boards would break before these wires ever did!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nWhat's wrong? You're turning into an over-ripe avocado again.\n\n\n\n\nBuddha statues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nOh, wow! Look at these neat Buddha statues. Maybe I'll take one home with me.\nPhoenix:\nMaya!\nMaya:\nBut there are so many. They wouldn't notice if I took just one.\nPhoenix:\nAre you kidding? Of course they'll notice! What are you gonna do with one of those anyway?\nMaya:\nPut it in the office of course! We can trade that wooden statue in the office reception area for one of these!\nPhoenix:\n(You know, come to think of it, where did that wooden statue come from anyway...?)\n\n\n\n\nIncinerator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nHey! There's a giant robot buried in the snow!\nPhoenix:\n... Well, there's something buried in the snow, but... I think it's an incinerator.\nMaya:\nOh... Hee hee. But you've gotta admit it looks a lot like a robot.\nPhoenix:\nUm, sure... Anyway, I don't think it gets used much. It's looking pretty rusty.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Do you think this Giant Robo-cinerator can walk?\nPhoenix:\nI told you! It's not a robot! ...And it's not especially big either.\nMaya:\nBah, you have no imagination.

Um, let's just forget about it, OK?\n\n\n\n\nWooden log on left\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nLooks like there's something written on it.\nPhoenix:\nI can't read it, but if I had to take a good guess, I'd say it says, \"Inner Temple\".\nMaya:\nWhat's the point of a sign if you can't read it? Must be tough for the mailman when he's delivering here.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess the sign is a good indication of how long this place has been here...)\n\n\n\n\nGate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nSo that's the Inner Temple up ahead, huh?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks kinda run-down.\nMaya:\nWell, it wouldn't be very temple-like if it was all bright and shiny.\nPhoenix:\nSo you're training here tonight, huh?\nMaya:\nYup! Then everyone'll see my spiritual powers!\n...Uuurrrgh...ggnngh...ggh...\nPhoenix:\nSounds like your stomach wants to show off its digestive powers instead...\nMaya:\nI wonder if that roast is ready yet?February 7Inner TempleTraining HallPhoenix:\nMan, look at this place... It's just a tiny, freezing-cold room. So this is where you'll both be training, huh...Maya:\nHuh? What do you mean, \"both\"? I'm the only one.Phoenix:\nReally?

Looks like you've been bitten by the love bug, Nick!\n\n\n\n\nMattresses\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere are a bunch of musty looking blankets and bedding sets piled up here. I wonder why they're even here in the first place? \nMaya:\nIt's because all spiritual training is done under the supervision of a nun. I wonder if Sister Bikini is planning to sleep in here while I train? \nPhoenix:\n(But if they sleep, what's the point of having them here in the first place...?)\n\n\n\n\nSacred cavern entrance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nThe actual training area must be on the other side of this door.

I'll see you all tomorrow, I guess!Bikini:\nIris, please ring the bell at 10:00 for lights out, alright?Iris:\nYes, Sister Bikini.Bikini:\nAnd then, after you ring the bell, I want you to come join us at the Training Hall.Iris:\nI understand, Sister Bikini.Phoenix:\n(Maya and Bikini really seem excited about this training thing tonight...)Elise:\n...Well, Pearl? What are you going to do tonight?Pearl:\nWell, umm...Elise:\nIf you'd like, you can come to my room. Perhaps we can read some books together.Pearl:\nR-Really!? I'd love to! I, umm... I'm not very good at reading.Elise:\nHa ha ha. Well then, would you like to practice reading with me?Pearl:\nAh! I'd love to!Phoenix:\n(Pearls is absolutely smitten with Ms. Deauxnim...) So Larry, what are you going to do?Butz:\nHuh... Me? Um, well... I'm just gonna hang out in my room. I can't stand the cold at all.Phoenix:\n(I totally hear you there.)Pearl:\nUm, Ms. Elise? So, for example, how do you read this?Elise:\nIt says, \"gravely\"... That's kind of a tough word.Pearl:\nOh! OK! And what about this word?Elise:\nThat's another tough one. It says, \"roast\".Phoenix:\n(What kind of a book is she reading anyway...?)Pearl:\nWell, I'm going to go wash the dishes and help clean up. I'll go visit you when I'm done, Ms. Elise!Phoenix:\n(Well, not much to do except head to my room and huddle under the covers, I guess...)February 7, 9:12 PMHazakura TempleMain HallPhoenix:\n(Ugh... It's a whole different type of cold up here in the mountains! Argh... Why couldn't the nearest bathroom be just a little closer to my room...?)???:\n...Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nYaaaaaaah! Oh! Ah, Ms. Deauxnim! Are you going to use the bathroom, too?Elise:\nUm, no. But... Have you seen Pearl?Phoenix:\nNo... Not since after dinner. I thought she said she was going to go to your room...Elise:\nI know... But she never showed up. I-I'm going to go look for her. ...Excuse me.Phoenix:\n(Ms. Elise Deauxnim... A woman as mysterious in origin as her last name... But... The really mysterious one is...)Iris:\nOh...Phoenix:\nAh...! S-Sister Iris...!Iris:\nG... G-Good evening...Phoenix:\n(The real mysterious one is this girl...!)Iris:\nUm, are you on your way to the bathroom too, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n(...I can't let this chance pass me by! I should try to talk with her... And maybe get some answers.)Move\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n...It's freezing cold out there. And dark, too. There's nothing I need to do, so I think I'll just stay roasty-toasty in here.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... You're Sister Iris, right?\nIris:\n...Yes.\nPhoenix:\nS-So... um, when did you come to Hazakura Temple?\nIris:\n... I don't remember. Ever since I was a small child, the temple has been my home.\nPhoenix:\nSo you've never left?\nIris:\nWell, I don't have any family left to take care of me... Sister Bikini... I've come to think of her as my real mother, as it were.\nPhoenix:\nAh, I see... But you... Didn't you go to college? ...And maybe enroll with the Ivy University Literature Department?\nIris:\nNo, I never had an interest in going to a big university like that... My training is all the education I need.\nPhoenix:\nI... I see...\nIris:\nBut... Once in a while, when I get the chance, I make a trip to the nearby town. I can use a computer and a cell phone, too.\nPhoenix:\n... (That's not exactly something worth bragging about... But I don't see any Psyche-Locks... ...so I guess that means she's not lying...)\nIris:\nP-Please don't stare at me like that...\n\n\n\n\nHazakura Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of a place is this anyway? I heard it's for training to increase your spiritual power or something like that.\nIris:\nIt must seem awfully crazy to normal people like you.\nPhoenix:\nWell, I have to admit it is a whole different world up here...\nIris:\nI'm glad to hear you say that.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nIris:\nTalking with dead people... Who does it help anyway? ...I hate it.\nPhoenix:\nR-Really? (So then why stay in a place like this...?)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Instead of showing her things, I really need to just listen to her story! This girl... Just who is she?)After clearing all Talk options:Iris:\nAh...Phoenix:\nIs something wrong?Iris:\nI-I didn't realize it was so late. I have to go and ring the bell for lights out...Phoenix:\n(I guess it's almost 10:00 now, huh?)Iris:\n... Um... Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n...Yes?Iris:\nIf it's alright with you... I would like you to have this.Phoenix:\nBut this is your hood...Iris:\nIt has the power to protect you from evil spirits.Phoenix:\n(Come to think of it, Sister Bikini was wearing one of these, too...)Iris:\nI pray for your safety on this dark, cold night.Iris's Hood received from Iris.Iris:\nI'm sorry, but I must bid you goodnight.Phoenix:\nWait a minute, Sister Iris...Iris:\nY-Yes...?Phoenix:\nJust now, you called me by my name... You said, \"Mr. Wright\". How did you know my name? I never introduced myself to you.Iris:\nTh-That's...Phoenix:\n...Sister Iris. Please, tell me the truth. You and I... Have we ever met before?Iris:\n...5 PSYCHE-LOCKSPhoenix:\nI-Iris...Iris:\nO-Oh! It-It's almost 10:00...

On the ground...!) M-Ms. Deauxniiiiiim!...*squish*Phoenix:\n(...I just stepped on something soft.)Bikini:\nHey! Don't step on my tummy like that!Phoenix:\nWh-What are you doing lying there in the snow!?Bikini:\nI was passed out! What do you think!?Phoenix:\nSo that blood-curdling scream was you...?Bikini:\nF-Forget about that! H-Hurry up and call the police!Phoenix:\nIs there even a phone in the Main Hall?Bikini:\nNo, but we still get reception up here in the mountains! You must have a cell phone on you, right!?Phoenix:\nI, um... I didn't bring it with me--Bikini:\nOh, you're useless! I mean, even Iris has a cell phone... We've got no choice! You'll have to use the public phone by Dusky Bridge! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Run as fast as you can!Phoenix:\nY-Yes, ma'am...Bikini:\nIf you don't hurry, Iris will... Iris will...!February 7, 11:18 PMDusky BridgePhoenix:\n...*huff*...*huff*... (It's farther than I thought. The bridge is just up ahead. I have to go tell Maya what happened, too!) ............ ...Aaaaaaaaaah! Dusky Bridge...! It's burning down! (What the heck happened!?)Butz:\nWhat are you doing here?Phoenix:\nAaaaaaaaah!Butz:\nHuh? What is it? Is it me?Phoenix:\nD-Don't scare me like that, Larry! I almost had a heart attack!Butz:\nMy name isn't Larry! It's Laurice!Phoenix:\nLarry, hurry up and call the police! I'm going to the Inner Temple!Butz:\nD-Don't be stupid! The bridge is nothing but a burning wreck right now!Phoenix:\nListen to me! There's been a murder! Here! At Hazakura Temple!Butz:\nWha-Whaaaaat!?Phoenix:\nThe murderer might have fled across the bridge! I have to make sure Maya is safe!Butz:\nB-B-But...Phoenix:\nPlease! Call the police! I've got to go! ...Get outta my way, Larry!Butz:\nIt-It's too dangerous! Nick, w-wait!Phoenix:\n(I must have been crazy... I knew how dangerous it was, but I still went for it...)...*crack!*...Phoenix:\nAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!Butz:\nNiiiiiick----!Phoenix:\n(Weakened even more by the fire, the rickety old bridge's planks snapped and gave way. And as I was swallowed by the eternal darkness that surrounded me... ...a final, terrified scream rose up to pierce the frozen air of that harrowing night.)To be continued.Date: ???

This is nothing more than a terrible nightmare... I'll just roll over and...)Butz:\nW-Wait! Don't hang up! ...It's an emergency! It's Nick! H-He... He took a really nasty spill!Edgeworth:\nWell, it wouldn't be the first time, so...Butz:\nI'm not joking! His life is in danger!Edgeworth:\nWh-What...!? What happened!? Tell me!Butz:\nTalk about a guy with bad luck! He may already be dead! Anyway, you've got to come back! You're the only one that can help! My Iris... My beautiful Iris! She needs help...!Edgeworth:\nAlright. I don't know what's going on, but... I'll be there as soon as I can.Butz:\nI-I'm at the detention center! Please! Hurryyyyyy!Phone:\n...*beep*...Edgeworth:\n(It's been one year since I left that country... I thought I wouldn't have to see him again for a while... Sounds like it won't be a pretty reunion... As if I expected anything to change.)February 8, 2:19 PMDetention CenterVisitor's RoomButz:\nYou're late, Edgey! What took you so long!?Edgeworth:\nI don't want to hear it! I chartered a private jet to come as quickly as I could!Butz:\nWell, you should've chartered a faster one! Anyway, just listen! Something happened to Ms. Elise... and Nick is... Maya... and Iris's Bikini... ...Huh? Say something, Edgey!Edgeworth:\n...Before I came here, I stopped in at the hospital where Wright is. I believe I have a better understanding of the situation than you, at this point. The murder victim was the picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. She was found by Wright and the head nun. The suspect is the temple's younger nun. Then later, while Wright was crossing the bridge, it broke and he fell into the river. The hospital says that he'll need at least 2 days of bed rest.Butz:\nY-Yes! Th-That's right! You got it! B-But they arrested her... My sweet little Iris!Edgeworth:\n(And here I was, convinced HE was the one the police had arrested...) However... I still don't understand what these two items are for.Butz:\nWhat are you talking about?Edgeworth:\nThey're things Wright gave to me when I was leaving his room. (This is the first... He said some nonsense about being able to see into people's hearts with this... And the other... He couldn't possibly be asking what I think he is... could he?)Butz:\nI'm begging you! Iris's trial starts tomorrow! With Nick out of the picture, you're all I've got left! You're the only one that can represent her!Edgeworth:\n... What did you just say?Butz:\nYou know! REPRESENT! DEFEND! What were you expecting!? Why do you think I called you anyway!?Edgeworth:\n...I'm a prosecutor, Larry. A prosecutor. Do YOU understand what I'm saying? A prosecutor is a lawyer who...Butz:\nDon't talk to me like a kid! I graduated from junior high, you know! Don't worry about it! I promise I won't tell!Edgeworth:\nBut I...Butz:\nI mean, I heard a paper badge had no problem fooling an entire court before!Edgeworth:\n(...How could this country's judicial system have fallen into such decay!?)Butz:\nPlease, Edgey! At least listen to her... Listen to Iris's side of the story!Edgeworth:\n(So Wright wasn't joking when he gave me this badge after all...)Iris:\nThank you for coming. ...My name is Iris.Edgeworth:\n...Edgeworth. Miles Edgeworth. I don't know if I can be of any help, but... ...I will at least hear what you have to say. ...About the murder.Iris:\nUm...Edgeworth:\n...?Iris:\nM-Mr. Wright! H-H-How is he? Mr. Laurice said that he... That he might even die...Edgeworth:\n... Fortunately, he will be fine. (Larry, you moron! How could you say something like that!?) He was badly bruised when he hit the water, but otherwise he is unharmed.Iris:\n... Thank goodness...Edgeworth:\nBut, he's caught some kind of nasty cold.Iris:\nA cold...?Edgeworth:\nHe's running a high fever and is drifting in and out of consciousness.Iris:\n...Edgeworth:\n(I must be imagining things. This woman... I feel like I've met her before...)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurveillance camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe camera is glaring at me. \"If something glares at you, it's only polite to return the favor,\" is what I was taught. ...\nIris:\nUm... Is something bothering you?\nEdgeworth:\n...Hm? Oh, e-excuse me.\n\n\n\n\nGuard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe guard is glaring at me. \"If something glares at you, it's only polite to return the favor,\" is what I was taught. ...\nIris:\nUm... Are you alright, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n...Hm? Oh, e-excuse me.Move\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Going to a crime scene is akin to entering a jungle teeming with dangerous beasts. Before he goes there, a hunter needs to make sure he has plenty of ammunition. And in my case, that \nammunition is called, \"information\".Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nPardon me... Iris. I would like to ask you something, if you don't mind. I have the distinct feeling you and I have met before...\nIris:\nI-It must be your imagination, Mr. Edgeworth. After all... I hardly ever leave Hazakura Temple.\nEdgeworth:\nHazakura Temple? What's that?\nIris:\nIt's a place where those who wish to boost their spiritual power come to train. You need to undergo some very difficult training to release your inner spiritual power.\nEdgeworth:\nSpiritual power...? Did you go to that temple for that reason as well?\nIris:\nNo... I don't have any spiritual powers. I don't need them.\nEdgeworth:\nIn that case, what are you doing at that temple then?\nIris:\n... I... I've committed some sins. Sins that I need to pay for. That's why I'm there, and why I continue to train... To purify my soul.\n\n\n\n\nThe night of the crime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI want to ask you about last night... The night of the crime.\nIris:\nAlright... I helped to clean up after dinner, and then went back to my room at about 8:00. Later, I left my room to ring the lights out bell at 10:00.\nEdgeworth:\nBell...?\nIris:\n...We ring it at the same time each night.\nEdgeworth:\nI see... And then?\nIris:\nA-And then...\nEdgeworth:\n...?\nIris:\nI was told to go to the Training Hall, but... I went back to my room... and stayed there...\nEdgeworth:\nWhy didn't you go to the Training Hall like you were asked to?\nIris:\n...I-I was frightened.\nEdgeworth:\n(\"Frightened\"...?)\nIris:\nSo I just stayed in my room and meditated... until the murder happened.\nEdgeworth:\n(There's more to her story.  I just know there is. Maybe  I should dig a little deeper.)\n\n\n\n\nFrightened? (appears after \"The night of the crime\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou were asked to go to the Training Hall on the night of the murder?\nIris:\nYes...\nEdgeworth:\nHowever... You didn't go. Because you say you were frightened. What exactly were you so frightened of?\nIris:\n...!\n\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Wh-What in the world!?)\nIris:\nUm... Is there something wrong?\nEdgeworth:\n...I'm sorry. It's nothing. (It looks like she's not aware of them herself... These must be what Wright was talking about... The \"Psycholocks\"! I believe he said that I need to present this \"Magatama\" item to do something...)\nIris:\n...?\n\n\n\n\nFrightened? (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nI... I don't like to walk alone at night. And, last night was...\nEdgeworth:\nWhat about last night?\n\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n\nIris:\nEr, oh... nothing. It's rather silly...\nEdgeworth:\nSo there was something special about last night, hmm?\nIris:\nNngh...\nEdgeworth:\n(It looks like I have no choice but to break these locks...)\n\n\n\n\nAny idea? (before clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night?\nIris:\n...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed.\nEdgeworth:\nSpiritual power...?\nIris:\nYes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example...\nEdgeworth:\n...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science. I don't believe in \"spiritual power\".\nIris:\nYes... I understand. Most people don't.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd I am certain that the thing that killed the victim was a human. So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim?\nIris:\n... No. I'm not the one who took her life.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... (That was foolish of me... It's not as if I can know for certain if she is telling me the truth...)\n\n\n\n\nAny idea? (after clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night?\nIris:\n...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed.\nEdgeworth:\nSpiritual power...?\nIris:\nYes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example...\nEdgeworth:\n...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science. I don't believe in \"spiritual power\".\nIris:\nYes... I understand. Most people don't.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd I am certain that the thing that killed the victim was a human. So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim?\nIris:\n... No. I'm not the one who took her life.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... (Those Psycholock things aren't appearing... I suppose that means I can believe that she's not lying.) ...Heh.\nIris:\nWhat's wrong?\nEdgeworth:\n(I can't believe what I'm thinking... And here I just finished saying that I don't believe in spiritual power...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nIs that an attorney's badge?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, this belongs to Wright.\nIris:\nReally?\nEdgeworth:\nI'm actually a prosecutor.\nIris:\nOh...! Then why do you have a defense attorney's badge pinned on your lapel...?\nEdgeworth:\nWell, you see... I, um... I borrowed it.\n\n\n\n\nHanging Scroll\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWho is the woman on this hanging scroll?\nIris:\nWell, I don't know the details, but... I've heard she's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique.\nEdgeworth:\nM-Master?\nIris:\nYes. Mystic Misty. She was a great spirit medium. ...That's what I've heard. I also heard that she went missing over 15 years ago.\nEdgeworth:\n... Spirit mediums... There's no such thing anyway...\nIris:\nMr. Edgeworth...?\nEdgeworth:\nI know all about them... They're nothing but frauds!\nIris:\n...?\nEdgeworth:\n(She doesn't know anything about it, of course... But there was a time, 17 years ago, when I met the \"Master\" myself...)\n\n\n\n\nIris's Hood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nThat's called a \"Demon-Warding Hood\". ...I gave that to Mr. Wright last night.\nEdgeworth:\nHe was wearing this when I saw him at the hospital today.\nIris:\nIt's an important item for protecting acolytes from evil spirits.\nEdgeworth:\nIf it's so important, then why did you give it to him?\nIris:\nLast night... I felt... something... I felt that something terrible was about to happen... I... I didn't want Mr. Wright to fall into its grip.\nEdgeworth:\n(Well he wound up falling into something much deeper and colder... I probably shouldn't say that out loud, though. Thank god for inner monologue.)\n\n\n\n\n\"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\n...I was against the idea of our temple appearing in that magazine. I was afraid that... this type of a tragedy might occur.\nEdgeworth:\nIn that case, why did you allow them to run an article about you?\nIris:\nIt was Sister Bikini... She's actually rather fond of attention... Surprisingly so.\nEdgeworth:\n(She certainly does look rather happy in this photo...)\n\n\n\n\nPhoto of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nThat's Mystic Elise Deauxnim. She's a picture book author, or so I've heard.\nEdgeworth:\nDoes she come to Hazakura Temple often...?\nIris:\nNo... This was her first time. It's just that...\nEdgeworth:\n...?\nIris:\nShe was a very important visitor.\nEdgeworth:\nIs that so?\nIris:\nYes, Sister Bikini told me, \"Be certain not to offend her.\"\nEdgeworth:\n(The victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim... The prosecutor's office still doesn't have much information about her it seems...)\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix Wright profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nMr. Wright... How bad is his cold?\nEdgeworth:\nWell his fever is very high. As a result, he's rather confused. He's worried about Maya, who is still trapped in the Inner Temple... ...And he's quite worried about you as well, it seems.\nIris:\n...Really?\nEdgeworth:\nYes... Naturally, once he recovers, I'll pass the baton back to him.\nIris:\nNo... Don't... I'm sure that Mr. Wright wouldn't want that... He wouldn't want to defend me.\n\n\n\n\nLarry Butz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nOh... That's Mr. Laurice.\nEdgeworth:\n...I'm sorry? Who did you say it was?\nIris:\nLaurice Deauxnim. He is Mystic Elise's apprentice, I think.\nEdgeworth:\n(Alright... Now who exactly is this guy...?)\nIris:\nHe's a very sincere, hard-working person.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nIris:\nUm... Did I say something wrong, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nE-Excuse me. I was temporarily at a loss for words. (Take a trip... Come home... Be thrust suddenly into bizarro world...)\n\n\n\n\nIris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nYou want to know about me? There's not much to tell, I'm afraid.\nEdgeworth:\nJust let me get one thing straight. You were raised at Hazakura Temple, correct? And yet, somehow, you seem to know Wright.\nIris:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nSo you two must have crossed paths somewhere.\nIris:\n...No, Mr. Edgeworth. Whomever it was... ...it couldn't have been me.\nEdgeworth:\n(What is that supposed to mean?)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nI'm sorry... I don't leave the temple grounds very often... So I don't know very much about the outside world.After clearing all Talk options:Edgeworth:\nHmm... It appears that's about all that you can tell me.Iris:\nThank you very much for listening to my story.Edgeworth:\n...I visited Wright at the hospital before coming here. He asked me to take care of you...Iris:\n...M-Me?Edgeworth:\nYes, at the trial tomorrow... He asked me to defend you.Iris:\n... If Mr. Wright has that much faith in you, Mr. Edgeworth... ...Then I will gladly entrust my fate in your capable hands.Edgeworth:\nBut before that, I have one question.Iris:\nYes?Edgeworth:\nDo you know Wright?Iris:\nEr... Wh-Why would you ask that?Edgeworth:\nWhenever you came up in our conversation, he would begin to act a little... strange.Iris:\n... Mr. Edgeworth... What is Mr. Wright to you? (Changed from [Mr. Edgeworth... Are you his friend?] in the original release)Edgeworth:\n...He is a very dear and indispensable friend. (Changed from [Friend? Well... In a sense, yes.] in the original release)Iris:\n... It was 5 years ago... That's when I... That's when I... deceived him.Edgeworth:\nYou \"deceived\" him...?Iris:\nI heard that he was... in a lot of pain after what happened. I know what a weak person I am. That's why... That's why I thought it was best if he never saw me again. I wanted him to just forget about me, without learning the truth.Edgeworth:\n... Well, if you ask me, Wright is still suffering... And until he learns the truth, I don't think he will ever be able to truly recover. ...Iris. It's not too late. You should go to him. ...Tell him the truth.Iris:\n...Edgeworth:\nI'll defend you, but only if you agree to that one condition.Iris:\n... Alright, Mr. Edgeworth... I promise.Edgeworth:\n...Very well. I'll do everything in my power to get you an acquittal. (That's enough information gathering for now. I should head to the crime scene...)February 8Dusky BridgeEdgeworth:\n(It sure is cold alright... So this is it... Dusky Bridge...)???:\nOh, wow! It's you, Mr. Edgeworth! (Changed from [Ahem! M-Mr. Edgeworth!] in the original release)Edgeworth:\nNngh... Detective Gumshoe. (Changed from [Urk... Detective Gumshoe.] in the original release)Gumshoe:\nLong time no see! It's been about a year? ...Or has it been longer?Edgeworth:\nIt doesn't matter, Detective. What does matter is why you're shuffling around up here.Gumshoe:\nOh, ouch! ...And there's that sharp left jab! (Changed from [Oh, ouch! ...And there was a sharp left jab!] in the original release) Well, I'm happy to see you anyway, Mr. Edgeworth!Edgeworth:\nLet me guess... You were transferred by HR to the local precinct? (Changed from [Let me guess... You were transferred into another section at work.] in the original release) A wise decision. The vast amount of nothing up here should be quite easy to guard. (Changed from [A good choice. The vast amount of nothing up here must be quite easy to guard.] in the original release)Gumshoe:\nI heard you were back in the country and arranged to come all the way out here! Everybody was real nice. They even let me take charge of the investigation, sir.Edgeworth:\n(...Gumshoe indeed! Like gum on your shoe, he's impossible to get rid of!)Gumshoe:\nI'm supposed to report on the details of the crime scene, sir! Anyway! Here I am! Detective Dick Gumshoe! Reporting for duty!Edgeworth:\n...Great. Um, thank you, Detective.Gumshoe:\nI thought Prosecutor Godot was gonna get here before me. That guy's a real mystery, I tell you!Edgeworth:\n(...Prosecutor Godot?)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCliff on other side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt looks like a pretty good distance to that far cliff.\nGumshoe:\nYeah... It's gotta be around 100 yards or so.\nEdgeworth:\n... Detective... That's not even CLOSE to a hundred yards.\nGumshoe:\nWell... I gotta admit I'm not very good at judging distances.\nEdgeworth:\n(It's about 20 yards or so. And impossible to cross without a bridge, it seems...)\n\n\n\n\nWooden sign on left side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThere's a little shack down that way called, \"Heavenly Hall\".\nEdgeworth:\nA shack...?\nGumshoe:\nIt's like a run-down doghouse for losers that can't bear the freezing drafts of wind... Kinda reminds me of my apartment, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nThe name \"Heavenly Hall\" makes it sound like a palace...\nGumshoe:\nGiving a hovel a great name is a crime itself! I'd call it false advertising! By the way, the name of my apartment complex is \"Compton Castles\"...\nEdgeworth:\n...That's not such a great name, if you ask me.\nGumshoe:\nWell, it's not such a great apartment either, sir.\n\n\n\n\nBridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo this is the bridge Wright tried to cross?\nGumshoe:\nPretty reckless, if you ask me.\nEdgeworth:\nI'm amazed he survived the fall from up here...\nGumshoe:\nYeah, he's one lucky guy, sir. Now I see how he manages to win his cases in court. Blind luck.\nEdgeworth:\n(I think dumb luck suits Wright just a bit better.)\n\n\n\n\nBoulder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSome letters are wildly engraved into a roughly cut boulder. \"Dusky Bridge\"... It certainly is an appropriate name.\nGumshoe:\nYou need to get some glasses, Mr. Edgeworth! That sign says, \"Dusty Bridge\". I can see how you read it wrong, though, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nYou're the one who needs glasses, Detective. Try reading it one more time.\nGumshoe:\n... Ah! You're right! It's \"Dusky Bridge\" after all! ... I guess whoever wrote this made a mistake!\n\n\n\n\nPublic phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nHey! It's a public phone! You don't see a lot of these anymore!\nEdgeworth:\n...That's true.\nGumshoe:\nSince we've got one here, why don't we take a photo as a memento!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, um, sure. Why not?\nGumshoe:\nOh, darn it! I don't have a camera with me! ...I'm gonna go buy a disposable camera! I'll be right back, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n(What's so special about public phones, and why is he so fascinated by them...?)Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened (before visitng Main Hall)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case...\nGumshoe:\nIt's simple!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, simple is as simple does, as they say.\nGumshoe:\nOh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing!\nEdgeworth:\nA witness...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that Bikini lady.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Bikini lady\"? Here? On this freezing cold mountain?\nGumshoe:\n...Well, you should talk to her yourself if you want the details, sir.\nEdgeworth:\n(I may have to talk to this \"bikini lady\"... I mean, \"decisive witness\" myself...)\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened (after visitng Main Hall)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case...\nGumshoe:\nIt's simple!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, simple is as simple does, as they say.\nGumshoe:\nOh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing!\nEdgeworth:\nA witness...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that Bikini lady.\n\n\n\n\nDusky Bridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo this is the bridge that Wright fell through?\nGumshoe:\nYup! I can't imagine being that reckless myself... \"Look before you cross,\" is how it goes, right? Or was that \"leap\"...?\nEdgeworth:\nAnd? Is there something on the other side?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, some old building they call the Inner Temple... But we can't get over there without a bridge, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat...?\nGumshoe:\nNobody lives there, so it's usually not a problem... But someone was at the Inner Temple doing some training and now they're stuck there.\nEdgeworth:\nYes, I heard that from Wright. It's Maya Fey.\nGumshoe:\nOh no... Her again...? Anyway, the air's really turbulent right now so we can't do an aerial extraction. No one's gonna be able to reach the Inner Temple until tomorrow, sir.\nEdgeworth:\n(Will she be alright in this cold...?) So how did this bridge burn down anyway?\nGumshoe:\nWe're almost 100% sure it was lightning.\nEdgeworth:\n...Lightning?\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor Godot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo who is this Prosecutor Godot? I've never heard of him.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, he's a new guy... Showed up after you left the country! He's a complete rookie, but nobody can say a bad word about the guy.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat kind of a man is he?\nGumshoe:\nHe just became a prosecutor recently, but he's good, sir. Real good.\nEdgeworth:\n(If he's so good, how is it that I've never heard of him...?) Is he the lead prosecutor on this case?\nGumshoe:\nYou bet he is! After all, \"you know who\" is right in the middle of it.\nEdgeworth:\n\"You know who\"?\nGumshoe:\nPhoenix Wright, of course! For some reason, Godot has really got it in for Mr. Wright!\nEdgeworth:\nOh?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, he seems to have some kind of a grudge.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd what would be the cause of this grudge...?\nGumshoe:\nI dunno... Maybe he made fun of his mask or something.\nEdgeworth:\n(None of this is making any sense. I'd better look into this Godot myself.)\n\n\n\n\nLightning (appears after \"Dusky Bridge\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning?\nGumshoe:\nYup. Last night it snowed for the first time in 3 days. It's a little unusual for lightning to occur during a snow fall like that... But according to the weather data, lightning definitely struck.\nWeather Data added to the Court Record.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm, I see... This is a very detailed weather report... Almost too detailed... It even has the exact time that the lightning struck the bridge...\nGumshoe:\nOh, that? We got that information from the witness's testimony.\nEdgeworth:\nSomeone actually saw the lightning hit the bridge? Who is this witness?\nGumshoe:\n... Sorry. I'll go ask one of the local cops later, sir.\n\n\n\n\nLightning (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning?\nGumshoe:\nYup.

What's that thing doing on your lapel, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n...Is it really that odd?\nGumshoe:\nYou bet it is, sir! A prosecutor wearing a defense attorney's badge? That's like a detective with a license to kill!\nEdgeworth:\n(Does this little thing hold that ominous of a meaning...?)\n\n\n\n\nMagatama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHave you ever seen this thing before...?\nGumshoe:\nHey, thanks a lot. I was getting kind of hungry! ...*chomp!*\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What are you doing, Detective!?\nGumshoe:\nAck! ...I thought it was some kind of candy that would fill me up, sir. Lately I've been feeling so hungry all the time...\nEdgeworth:\n(Nngh... Maybe his salary has been cut just a little too much...?)\n\n\n\n\nPhoto of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThere's a lot we don't know about this victim... We don't know her real name, her background... We don't know anything really.\nEdgeworth:\nThat's rather odd... If she was trying to hide her identity, why would she become an author?\nGumshoe:\nI'll bet it was just one of those things. You know... She probably never expected to get so popular.\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix Wright profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nWhenever something happens, this guy always shows up like he hasn't got a care. In fact, you know what...? Every time he shows up, I always wonder the same thing. \"Maybe somehow he's actually the cause of all these incidents!\"\nEdgeworth:\n(I wonder if Gumshoe has realized it yet... But you could say the exact the same thing about him!)\n\n\n\n\nDick Gumshoe profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYour face is more drawn out than the last time I saw you over a year ago.\nGumshoe:\nR-Really? I thought so!\nEdgeworth:\nNo, wait... It's not so much \"drawn out\", as \"weary and tired\", or maybe just plain old \"thin\".\nGumshoe:\nI thought that too, sir. My salary's been kinda on the low end... So yeah, my food options have been kinda non-existent. Off-brand chicken soup, off-brand spaghetti, off-brand bread... That sort of stuff.\nEdgeworth:\nI thought you were really into instant noodles last year...?\nGumshoe:\n...I got really sick of the stuff after a while, sir.\n\n\n\n\nLarry Butz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nHe's supposed to be Ms. Elise Deauxnim's apprentice or something.\nEdgeworth:\n...I see.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, he drew a nice portrait of me.\nEdgeworth:\n...That's nice.\nGumshoe:\nBut he made me pay him 50 cents for it.\nEdgeworth:\n...I'm sorry about that.\nGumshoe:\n... You don't seem very interested in him, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\n...I really don't want to talk about him. That's why.\n\n\n\n\nIris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI feel like I've seen this girl somewhere before! She wasn't from a prior case, was she?\nGumshoe:\nNope, can't be. We did a database search with her fingerprints and came up with nothing.\nEdgeworth:\nI see... (I just can't shake this nagging feeling...)\nGumshoe:\nWell, everyone knows that you are quite popular with the ladies, sir... Maybe she's an old girlfriend that you sent to Dumpsville when you were younger.\nEdgeworth:\nD-Detective! Where did you hear such nonsense from!?\nGumshoe:\nI didn't hear it from anyone. It's just sorta how I imagine you to be... sir.\nEdgeworth:\n(...D-Do I really inspire this sort of frothing desire from the female masses?)\n\n\n\n\nGodot profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI usually hear about promising young prosecutor candidates while they're still in school. But I've never seen or heard of this person.\nGumshoe:\nI gotta admit... He's puzzling alright. He just appeared one day, big mug of steaming coffee in his hand...\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... He sounds like an interesting man...\nGumshoe:\nYeah... The whole prosecutor's office is really into double espresso macchiatos lately.\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nLook, I'm just your everyday, simple detective. Don't ask me such tough questions, OK?\nEdgeworth:\n...That's not something to be proud of, Detective!February 8Detention CenterVisitor's RoomEdgeworth:\n(It looks like Iris is being interrogated right now.) ...This place certainly brings back memories.Gumshoe:\nOh yeah. Come to think of it, you got thrown in here once too, didn't you, sir? But you know what? I've never been in jail a single time!Edgeworth:\n(I should think it's hard to land in jail when you're so harmless...) Yes, well... If you're in jail, you don't have to pay for your own meals, you know.Gumshoe:\n...*gasp!* ...Edgeworth:\nDon't get any funny ideas, Detective...!Gumshoe:\n...Too late, I already did.Edgeworth:\n(In any case... I guess I'll have to come back here later...)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurveillance camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThat camera is meant to monitor everything that happens in here. And right now, it's pointed straight at the guard.\n\n\n\n\nGuard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe guard is staring at me with a puzzled expression on his face. Me... and the badge on my lapel. ...I get the feeling he recognizes me.February 8Hazakura TempleMain GateButz:\nYo! Edgey! What took you so long!? I'm so cold, my brain's turned to sherbet.Edgeworth:\n...I knew it was a mistake to race back to this country.Butz:\nWh-What do you mean...?Edgeworth:\nWright is going to be fine, and the case itself isn't anything unusual...

I just know it, OK!? So trust me on this one!Edgeworth:\nEver the romantic, aren't you, Larry? Nevertheless, I'll do whatever I can to prove her innocence.

Like a fine wine, it gets better with age!\nEdgeworth:\nEven fine wine turns to vinegar and begins to stink at some point. ...I suggest you wash that atrocious rag you call a coat, Detective.\n\n\n\n\nMain Hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThat must be the Main Hall back there.\nGumshoe:\nA brilliant deduction, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n............

There's something I've always wondered about...\nEdgeworth:\n(Something tells me he's going to tell me what's on his mind, whether I like it or not...)\nGumshoe:\nWe call a person who tells a lie a \"liar\", right? So why don't we call a person who rings a bell a \"beller\"? Or \"truer\" for a guy who tells the truth!

After all, I saved his life.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is that supposed to mean?\nButz:\nIf I hadn't called for help so quickly, he would have died. It's no surprise though. I used to be a security guard.

Look at all these ancient straw frisbees!\nEdgeworth:\nThose are a type of \"zabuton\" cushions called \"enza\"!\nGumshoe:\n... Why are you giving me such a hard time? Huh, Mr. Edgeworth?

Please don't blow out the altar candles!\n\n\n\n\nMagatama on altar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...That thing sure casts a strong presence over the whole room.\nBikini:\nThis is the \"Lesser Magatama\".

What is the \"greater\" one like?\nBikini:\nThe \"Greater Magatama\" is displayed in the Main Room of Fey Manor. It was supposed to be shown at the Treasures of Kurain exhibit...

A super-duper prosecutor!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, I suppose it takes a super-duper kind of dumb to miss a clue like this.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe night of the crime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nFirst, I'd like to ask you about last night.\nBikini:\nWell, last night... we had an acolyte here for training. After dinner, the two of us went to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple.\nEdgeworth:\n(She must be talking about Maya...) Approximately what time was that...?\nBikini:\nI suppose it was about 9:00 when we left here. Training lasts all night long. It's extremely exhausting. The channeling dojo's Head Nun must be in attendance at all times to keep watch.\nGumshoe:\nWow, you're right! That does sound exhausting!\nEdgeworth:\nDetective, this is no time for flattery.\nGumshoe:\nSorry.\nEdgeworth:\nSome time around 11:00, you witnessed the incident in the courtyard. But your duty was in the Inner Temple. Why did you come back here?\nBikini:\nHmm... The way you're staring at me, I'm starting to get goosebumps! Ha ha ha ho ho!\nEdgeworth:\n(Nngh... I'm starting to get goosebumps myself, but for a decidedly different reason.)\nGumshoe:\nHo ho, you get the chills pretty easy, don't you Mr. Edgeworth?\n\n\n\n\nWhat you saw\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAlright then... I'd like you to tell me exactly what you saw in the courtyard.\nBikini:\nIt must have been past 11:00. Ah! No! I can't say it! It-It's too much for my poor heart!\nGumshoe:\nHey! Calm down, lady! L-Let go of my tie!\nBikini:\n...I saw two people! One of them was lying on the ground... Th-The other one was stabbing her from the back... with a sword!\nEdgeworth:\nDid you see this criminal with your own eyes?\nBikini:\nI didn't want to believe what I was seeing...! ...But it was Iris!\nEdgeworth:\nYou must have been quite shocked.\nGumshoe:\nOf course she was! Try putting yourself in her shoes! It'd be like if you were stabbing Mr. Wright smack in the middle of a courtroom! And I happened to witness it from the witness stand! ...I'd be pretty shocked too.\nBikini:\nI know it sounds insane... But that's what I saw. And when I finally realized what I was seeing, I screamed, and then... I passed out.\nEdgeworth:\n(...Unfortunately for us, her testimony seems to be pretty solid.)\nBikini:\nHowever... The idea of Iris doing such a foul act seems... unnatural.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Unnatural\"...?\nBikini:\nThe girl I know simply isn't capable of this sort of foulness...\nEdgeworth:\n(...I wonder what she means by that?)\n\n\n\n\nWhy return? (appears after \"The night of the crime\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAs the head nun, it's your duty to stay with the acolyte at all times, correct?\nBikini:\nYes, that's correct. I know I may look strong, but the truth is... I've got a bad lower back.\nEdgeworth:\nA bad lower back...?\nBikini:\nYes, it's especially bad in the winter. So bad that I can't even lift a bucket. Do you remember how cold it was last night? My bad back felt as stiff as frozen glass. I just wanted to take a nice hot bath to ease my aching back... That's why I returned to the Main Hall.\nEdgeworth:\nSo you left the disciple all alone?\nBikini:\nDon't be ridiculous! I would never do that! That's why I ordered Iris to the Inner Temple after she had rung the bell for lights out.\nEdgeworth:\n(Yes, but she never went to the Inner Temple, did she? So did this head nun actually see Iris there? (Changed from [Did this head nun even see Iris?] in the original release) I think I'd better try to get some more details...)\n\n\n\n\nThe acolyte (appears after \"What you saw\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo who is this acolyte that was to train at the Inner Temple...?\nBikini:\nHer name is Maya Fey... I treated her very badly, I'm ashamed to say. And after she went through the trouble of signing up for the Special Course...\nGumshoe:\n\"Special Course\"?\nBikini:\nIt's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant 30,000 times...\nEdgeworth:\nYou don't mean to tell me she's still doing that over at the Inner Temple, do you?\nBikini:\nNo, no, no. Of course not! You don't have to worry about that one little bit. Last night, we still hadn't started the training session itself.\nEdgeworth:\nWell, um... That's good to hear.\nBikini:\n...Oh! Dear, dear! There's one thing I forgot to tell you.\nGumshoe:\n...Uh-oh, I don't think I like the sound of this.\nBikini:\nDo you know that small girl? I believe she is Mystic Maya's little sister.\nEdgeworth:\n(Maya has a little sister...?)\nGumshoe:\nOh, you mean little Pearl! That's Maya Fey's cousin.\nEdgeworth:\nLittle... Pearl...?\nBikini:\nI thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after we'd finished with dinner cleanup... (Changed from [I thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after cleaning up dinner...] in the original release) But I haven't seen her at all since late last night! She's nowhere to be found!\nEdgeworth:\nY-You mean she...!? She was with the victim!?\nBikini:\nIt's all the fault of my stupid, creaky old back!\nEdgeworth:\n(A little girl who was with the victim on the night of the murder... is gone!)\nGumshoe:\nAs they say... \"The plot thickens!\"Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagatama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nTh-That's...! That's one of the Fey clan's very own Magatamas! That's a priceless treasure you've got there!\nGumshoe:\nW...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me!\nBikini:\nYes... You don't look it, but now I can see you're a real fan of the occult!\nEdgeworth:\nExcuse me?\nBikini:\nOh, of course this piece couldn't possibly be real, but to have such a nice replica... Clearly, you are a big fan of the Kurain Tradition!\nGumshoe:\nW...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me!\nEdgeworth:\n(I should have known better than to show this thing around...)\n\n\n\n\nHanging Scroll\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nHuh... Ahh! Well, well, well... Look what you've found! That's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, Mystic Misty Fey!\nEdgeworth:\n\"Fey\"...\nBikini:\nIt's been nearly 20 years since Mystic Misty's disappearance. Apparently, she intended to pass on the Master title to her daughter.\nEdgeworth:\nWho is this daughter?\nBikini:\nWell, I myself am part of a branch family of the Fey clan. But even I am not privy to information concerning the main family...\n\n\n\n\nIris's Hood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nWell, well, well! That's a Demon-Warding Hood! Acolytes are highly susceptible to possession by evil spirits, you know. That's why we always wear these for protection.\nEdgeworth:\nOh, I see...\nBikini:\nWhat are you waiting for? You won't get any protection just by holding it, you know! Put it on already!\nEdgeworth:\nNo! I can't...! I was just...!\nBikini:\n... Ha ha ha ho ho ho!\nGumshoe:\nHo ho ho! It's like it was made just for you, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean by that, Detective!?\nBikini:\nIt looks absolutely marvelous! You've just got to keep it on for a while!\nEdgeworth:\n(Is this some sort of divine retribution...?)\n\n\n\n\n\"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAbout this picture...\nBikini:\nWell look at that! I look pretty s-to-the-exy, don't you think!?\nGumshoe:\nUm, ah... Y-Yeah. Absolutely.\nBikini:\nUp until recently, we've avoided exposure in such magazines. But this time we had our reasons...\nEdgeworth:\nIs that so? For exampl--?\nBikini:\nHa ha ha ha ha!!! Well, why deny the world the sight of such a lovely face!?\n\n\n\n\nPhoto of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\n...Ohhhh! H-How could such a... terrible thing have happened...? It's all... It's all... It's all my fault!\nGumshoe:\nWell come on, lady... I don't think you need to take all the blame yourself.\nBikini:\nQuiet! What do you know anyway!?\nGumshoe:\n...Ouch. You're scary!\nBikini:\nWith that stupid 5 o'clock shadow and that stupid old coat of yours... It's too bad that you weren't the one that disappeared!\nGumshoe:\n... ...Why does she have to take it all out on me?\nEdgeworth:\n(Her anger does seem a little... manufactured.)\n\n\n\n\nNote to Iris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nDo you know anything about this old, crumpled-up letter?\nBikini:\n... Is that addressed to Iris?\nGumshoe:\nYup, it clearly says \"To Iris\" on it.\nBikini:\nI can't believe it... That girl doesn't have any secrets from me...\nEdgeworth:\n(Ah... So Sister Bikini didn't know anything about it...)\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix Wright profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nThis man... His face betrays a life of suffering and great weariness of the world.\nEdgeworth:\n...Um, sure.\nBikini:\nBut even so... I can't believe this guy actually jumped into the river! Think of all the fun things he might have enjoyed if he had just lived... Relentless spiritual training alone is no way to lead a complete life, huh...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n(It sounds like she's got some major regrets she's dealing with... Hmm... Perhaps I should let Gumshoe explain Wright's situation to her for me...)\nGumshoe:\nH-Hey! Don't look at me like that! Do you own dirty work! ...Sir!\n\n\n\n\nLarry Butz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nThis is Mystic Elise's apprentice, is it not? I think he might have a bit of a crush on me... Sweet boy at any rate.\nGumshoe:\nHuh?\nBikini:\nOh, I don't blame him. Sister Bikini understands the temptations of young men.\nEdgeworth:\n...Sure.\nBikini:\nBut I'm afraid it wouldn't be proper to abuse my position. I am head nun, after all. But, in return, I did allow him to draw a portrait of me.\nEdgeworth:\n(I pray it was a pose that maintained your modesty. For everyone's sake...)\n\n\n\n\nIris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou said you went with Maya to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple last night. Did you happen to see Iris while you were there?\nBikini:\nOf course I saw her. I told her to meet us after ringing the 10:00 bell for lights out.\nGumshoe:\nSo you're saying Iris came to the Inner Temple then?\nBikini:\nOf course she did. Iris has always been a good, obedient girl. After that, I had Maya begin her training ceremony.\nEdgeworth:\n(But that doesn't fit with Iris's story at all... She said that she never went to the Inner Temple!)\nGumshoe:\nAs they say... \"The plot thickens!\"\n\n\n\n\nBikini profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nIt's all my fault... Me and my stupid back! Mystic Elise has been murdered, an important acolyte is trapped... ...and a little girl has been lost!\nGumshoe:\nYou know you really shouldn't be so negative. It creates bad karma...\nBikini:\n...Quite right. I need to do some more training myself, I think...\n\n\n\n\nMaya Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nShe's a very important visitor, you know! An honored acolyte!\nEdgeworth:\n\"Honored\"? How so?\nBikini:\nThe Fey name is synonymous with the Kurain Channeling Technique. Therefore, she must be a spirit medium of great power indeed.\nGumshoe:\nNow that you mention it, one year ago... ...there was a case that was about the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique!\nEdgeworth:\n...Detective. I detest talk of supernatural drivel. I suppose now you'll say she has midi-chlorians?\nGumshoe:\nHo ho ho. So it gives you the creeps, huh, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n(...That's got nothing to do with it.)\n\n\n\n\nPearl Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nOh, this poor girl... Where could she have gone...?\nGumshoe:\nWell, we checked out her home and she's not there.\nBikini:\nAnd she's nowhere in the vicinity of the temple either...\nEdgeworth:\n(Which means... ...there's only a few other possibilities as to where she could be.)\nGumshoe:\nAh! Do you think maybe she fell off the bridge and was carried downstream...!?\nEdgeworth:\n... Why do you have to be such a pessimist, Detective!?\nGumshoe:\nNngh... I was just trying to think like you, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\n(Ironic. I became a pessimist only after I had the pleasure of working with you!)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nUmm, about this here...\nBikini:\nHmm... Let me see... Well, as you may know... In order to see reality for what it truly is... ...we strive to break our attachments to much of the transient, material realm. I guess you could call me an \"immaterial girl\"!\nGumshoe:\nI guess she lives in an immaterial world, huh Mr. Edgeworth?Main Gate (before clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nI'm just no good with people like her.

Sure.\nEdgeworth:\nI don't care how you feel about her personally... ...just tell me what you know about her and how she's related to the case.\nButz:\n... Don't you think you're expecting a little too much of me? I'm just a 25 year old jobless bum trying to be an apprentice artist!

Are you really gonna defend that nun, Iris, at the trial tomorrow?Edgeworth:\nYes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitment. (Changed from [Yes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitments.] in the original release)Gumshoe:\nWell, in that case... I've gotta be careful... Gotta make sure I don't leak the prosecution's whole investigation...Edgeworth:\nDon't worry about it, Detective. Just keep your mouth closed and I think most of it will flow out on its own.Gumshoe:\n... You got it, sir! I'll make sure it flows out like water from a tap! (Changed from [Roger, sir! I know exactly what you're saying!] in the original release)Edgeworth:\nY-Yes, you do that, Detective. (Just how much has your runny spout leaked over the years?)

The front and back of the Main Hall are on different levels.\nGumshoe:\nOh... That makes sense...

Let's see if we can summarize what we've learned so far.\nGumshoe:\nOK! Let's take a look at the map. ...According to the testimony of Sister Bikini, the head nun... ...right after they'd finished dinner, she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple. (Changed from [...she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple right after dinner was finished.] in the original release) At 10 PM, after ringing the bell for lights out, Iris went to the Inner Temple. When she got there, Bikini had her take over while she went back to Hazakura Temple. After taking a hot bath to soothe her back... ...Sister Bikini witnessed the murder in the courtyard! If you want more details, you should ask Bikini herself in the Main Hall.\nEdgeworth:\n(The Inner Temple, huh...? I'd like some more information about that place...)\n\n\n\n\nTomorrow's trial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe trial begins tomorrow, but who's the prosecutor?\nGumshoe:\nI'm pretty sure it's that Godot guy, but... ...nobody can get a hold of him, so they're looking for a replacement.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean...?\nGumshoe:\nIt's really weird. All of a sudden, no one can reach him! Hmm, I wonder if the rumors are true. Maybe since Mr. Wright caught a cold and won't be defending, he just lost interest.\nEdgeworth:\nI intend to appear in court in the role of defense lawyer. However... I would be quite unhappy if it came out that I'm actually a prosecutor.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, I can see why. But I'm not the one you have to worry about... I think the real problem is gonna be that judge...\nEdgeworth:\n...Yes, he certainly would remember my face, even after such a long absence. That's why I requested another judge preside over the case. We've only met each other once. There's a good chance he won't remember me at all.\nGumshoe:\nY-Yeah, but... what about the prosecutor? Everyone in the prosecutor's office must know you! Wouldn't it be a problem if someone there made a big stink, sir?\nEdgeworth:\nThere's no need to worry. I pulled a few strings and arranged for a prosecutor of my own choosing.\nGumshoe:\nWow, Mr. Edgeworth... I had no idea you had such a powerful string to pull!\n\n\n\n\nInner Temple (appears after \"What happened\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this Inner Temple that Maya was supposedly training at...?\nGumshoe:\nAccording to Bikini, it's an old building they use for training the acolytes. It's on the other side of Dusky Bridge.\nEdgeworth:\n(The bridge that burned down, huh...) Is there anything else on the other side of that bridge besides the Inner Temple?\nGumshoe:\nNope, not a thing.\nEdgeworth:\nNothing?\nGumshoe:\nThe other side is surrounded by cliffs on all sides...

I'd make a really great one, don't you think?\nEdgeworth:\nWe just had this conversation a little while ago, Detective!\n\n\n\n\nShichishito\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThis sword represents the multiple branches that life can take, all ending as one.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... I've never heard that one.\nGumshoe:\nYou know what I think about sometimes? What kind of life would I have had if I hadn't joined the Homicide Division.\nEdgeworth:\n...So you think about that kind of thing too, huh?\nGumshoe:\nOf course I do. I think about it a lot. Me as a traffic cop. Me as a detention officer. Me as the Blue Badger...\nEdgeworth:\n(...I guess he doesn't have any plans to leave the force.)\n\n\n\n\nBikini profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThis is the witness who saw the crime take place out there in the temple courtyard. I'm pretty sure it's gonna be her testimony that'll be key to this case, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nSo you mean she's going to be a witness in the trial tomorrow...?\nGumshoe:\nOf course! A nun is as trustworthy as you can get! We got this one in the bag! ... Oh. I-I mean, I've always been on your side, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! So yeah, this is a pretty tight spot we've gotten ourselves into, huh!?\nEdgeworth:\n(Now I understand why Wright is always breaking into a cold sweat...)\n\n\n\n\nMaya Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI wonder if Maya is alright? I could never show my face to Wright again if something were to happen to her.\nGumshoe:\nAww, it'll be OK. If that ever happens, you can just show him my face. How's that...?\nEdgeworth:\n...\nGumshoe:\nAck! Um, I didn't mean it like that, sir! It was just a silly little joke!\nEdgeworth:\nI wonder if there is another way to get across to the other side? The support wires for the bridge are still intact, correct?\nGumshoe:\nThat bridge is almost 20 yards long... I know I may look like it, Mr. Edgeworth, but I'm no super hero.\nEdgeworth:\n(In any case, I just hope Maya is alright...)\n\n\n\n\nPearl Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat about Pearl...? Has no one seen her at all since last night?\nGumshoe:\nSeems that way... Apparently, she hasn't gone back to Kurain Village either, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nBut it's true that she was with Elise Deauxnim at some point last night?\nGumshoe:\nNo doubt about it. Ah...! Y-You mean that maybe whoever killed Ms. Deauxnim also...!?\nEdgeworth:\nD-Don't jump to any crazy conclusions!\nGumshoe:\nOooooouuuch! ...You sure have one mean punch, Mr. Edgeworth!

She said that when Maya Fey began her training at the Inner Temple... ...you were there as well.\nIris:\nWhat...!?\nEdgeworth:\nWhen I spoke with you last, you claimed that you never went to the Inner Temple. And yet, Sister Bikini says she met with you at the Inner Temple that very night.\nIris:\nB-But I... I didn't go there! I didn't go to the Inner Temple last night.\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm...

That's why I'm committed to searching until I have those answers. Now then, is it really true that you didn't go to the Inner Temple last night...?\nIris:\nY-Yes, I swear... I already told you that.\nEdgeworth:\n...Yes. You said you didn't go because you were frightened.\nIris:\n...Th-That's right.\nEdgeworth:\nIf that's the case... ...then the obvious question is, \"What were you so afraid of?\"\nIris:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nIris...

I'm still not used to this role I've been assigned.\nIris:\nN-No, I should apologize... I'm sorry for being such a scaredy-cat.\nEdgeworth:\nAnyway...

After all, even if I did have a \"secret\"... ...there's no one to tell it to that would cause me any grief.\nEdgeworth:\n... Hmm... I wonder about that.\nIris:\nSister Bikini is like a mother to me. I would never hide anything from her!\nEdgeworth:\nNo, you may not have anything to hide under normal circumstances. However!

Why do you say that...!?\nIris:\nAs they say, it takes one to know one.\nEdgeworth:\n(How could she have known about that...? Is she peering into my soul!?) ...It's true that there is a deep-seated darkness in my heart. However, the only way I can get rid of it is to fully uncover the truth!\nIris:\nYou mean... the truth behind my secret?\nLeads back to:\n\"Unfortunately, I don't know the exact nature of your secret yet.\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nPhoenix Wright...\nIris:\nAh...!\nEdgeworth:\nYou mean something to Wright, it seems... And I can tell he holds a special place in your heart as well. That's why you didn't want him, of all people, to know your deep, dark secret. Well? What do you have to say?\nIris:\n...

And she's taken care of me ever since.\nEdgeworth:\nForgive me for sounding rude, but what about your family?\nIris:\n... I'm sorry, but I'd rather not talk about this.\n\n\n\n\nMaya Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nOh... This is the woman who was to undergo training last night. She seems like a very strong, reliable woman.\nEdgeworth:\n...

I can't do that to someone who looks like he's down on his luck.Gumshoe:\n...He's just talking to himself.Edgeworth:\nShh! Be quiet and listen!Butz:\nI knew it... I shouldn't have done that! I blew it again...Edgeworth:\n(\"Done that\"? What did he do, I wonder...)Gumshoe:\nHey! You! About what you just said... I got an objection!Butz:\nWh-Wh-Wh-What the...!? Ed-Edgey! You dirty rat!Edgeworth:\n*glare* (Gumshoe... You oaf...!)Gumshoe:\nI-I'm sorry, sir! Before I knew it, I was shouting out, \"Objection!\". And in a loud, commanding voice, too! I even pointed with my pointer finger!Edgeworth:\n...You've watched too many trials.Gumshoe:\nI'm sorry!Edgeworth:\nOK, Larry, the jig is up. What have you got to say for yourself?Butz:\nUngh...Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEagle River\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThis is the Eagle River, sir. It runs pretty fast, so it doesn't ice over, even in the winter.\nEdgeworth:\nIf it had iced over, Wright would have been in some serious trouble.\nGumshoe:\nYou're right about that! He would've landed on the ice, and slid downstream to who knows where.\nEdgeworth:\n(...Not exactly what I meant, but alright...)\n\n\n\n\nDusky Bridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt's a little far, but I have a pretty clear view of Dusky Bridge from here.\nButz:\nAhh. I still can't believe it! ...Really.\nEdgeworth:\n...? What is it, Larry?\nButz:\nHuh! Err, uhh, nothing. It's nothing!\nGumshoe:\nSounds pretty suspicious to me!\nEdgeworth:\n(Something about that statement smells... And you know what they say...)\n\n\n\n\nStairway\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThese go all the way to Dusky Bridge. It's a pretty long, but easy, walk.\nGumshoe:\nI fell down 4 times on my way down here, sir!\nButz:\nOh, sorry about that, Detective. I ate four bananas and tossed their peels on the stairs on my way down here...\nGumshoe:\n... What!? So that's what I was slipping on!\nButz:\nBe careful on the way back. Those deadly banana peels are still out there.\nGumshoe:\nHmm... That's a real important piece of information right there, Mr. Edgeworth!\n\n\n\n\nString of flags\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this festive-looking ornament?\nButz:\nIt reminds me of art class in grade school. We used to have a lot of fun decorating the classroom with origami. Remember?\nEdgeworth:\nW-Well, I...\nButz:\nOh, yeah... You were never any good at it.\nGumshoe:\nReally?\nButz:\nYeah, this guy was so bad, he couldn't even fold a dollar, let alone a crane. Everyone tried to comfort him, but he would just sit there sobbing.\nGumshoe:\nReally? I never would have expected that.\nEdgeworth:\nBe quiet already! I'll never forget the shame of that day! You want a crane! I can now make a perfect quarter-inch crane without a single flaw!\nButz:\n... You know, Edgey... Nothing for nothing, but a quarter-inch crane without a single flaw is not easy.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's quite a feat, Prosecutor Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\n(Grr... This is exactly why I hate childhood friends...)\n\n\n\n\nShack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThat's a horrible graffiti problem you've got there, pal.\nButz:\nYou don't know anything, Detective. This is art! It's an expression of my bittersweet love for Iris.\nEdgeworth:\nLarry. Do you know what the difference between graffiti and true art is?\nButz:\n... It's how the artist himself defines it, right?\nEdgeworth:\n... (I should've seen that one coming.)\nGumshoe:\nWell, if that's the case, then all of my lunchboxes are masterpieces too, pal!\n\n\n\n\nRoof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe straw roof is totally covered with freshly fallen powdery snow.\nGumshoe:\nWow, makes a nice image, doesn't it? I always did like the rustic look.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Heavenly Hall\"... I suppose it's an appropriate name in some sense.\nButz:\nYou got that right. Look at that bridge up there. This place has to be heaven, because that thing is hell.\nEdgeworth:\n... You would do well to remember, Larry... ...that this is a sacred place to some people.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeavenly Hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this little shack anyway?\nButz:\nWell, I just discovered it myself yesterday.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd why were you down here in the first place?\nButz:\nErr, come on... I'm an artist... I was looking for a good place to sketch. This is a great little place! It's err... artistic. It's quiet, it's cold, it's got no power, and it looks like it's about to collapse.\nGumshoe:\n...Sounds a lot like my apartment there, pal.\nEdgeworth:\n(One thing's for sure... No one is likely to show up and disturb you here...)\nButz:\nSo can I get you something to drink? Some hot water, maybe?\nGumshoe:\n...He's getting all buddy-buddy on us, sir.\n\n\n\n\nIris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\n...Listen to me, Edgey. You've gotta do this... You've gotta save Iris!\nEdgeworth:\nWhy are you so sure she's innocent? Because she's cute?\nButz:\nWatch your mouth! Anyway, I've made up my mind about it! I'm going to marry that girl!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nGumshoe:\nUmm... Mr. Edgeworth is pretending he didn't hear you, so I'm gonna ask for him. Have you already asked this girl to marry you?\nButz:\nNo, no. Not yet. But I can tell how she feels by the look in her eyes! She's got this \"I really want this man to carry me over the threshold\" look! I'm sure Nick would be surprised! He'd never imagine that I could marry such a beautiful girl like that!\nEdgeworth:\nSomething tells me he would be shocked, indeed.\nButz:\nThat's why I didn't want her to do anything dangerous. I mean, what am I gonna do if she gets hurt?\nGumshoe:\n... What is this guy trying to say? He lost me about a mile back...\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... If we really want to know the answer to that... (...we're going to have to drag him onto the witness stand.)\n\n\n\n\nThe night of the crime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nCome to think of it, you still haven't answered my question. Where were you and what were you doing last night?\nButz:\nAww, man... Don't you have anything else to talk about? With that kind of attitude, you'll never be a ladies' man like me...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nButz:\nO-OK, OK! Chill out with those scary eyes! I got it! If you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Something incredible\"?\n\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n\nButz:\n...Yeah, yeah. But let's not talk about that now. Let's talk about the good old days. What do you say? Come on, I'll pour you a nice cup of hot water.\nEdgeworth:\n(Why hasn't he realized... ...that I absolutely despise talking about the \"good old days\", especially with him?)\n\n\n\n\nThe night of the crime (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat exactly did you see last night?\nButz:\nWell... It's kinda hard to say...\n\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n\nButz:\nIt's one of those things... Ya know what I mean...? It's like... It's not so much \"what\" I saw, as it's the situation in general... You see what I'm getting at? Whew, that's a relief. Thanks, buddy.

Wait, hold up.\nGumshoe:\n...What now, pal?\nButz:\nWhat are you talking about!? What \"threatening\" stuff!?\nGumshoe:\nI'll tell you what! You tried to scare Iris by threatening to expose her secret, pal!\nButz:\nWhat do you mean threaten!? When did I threaten her!?\nGumshoe:\n\"...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed...\" That sure sounds like a threat to me, pal! Blackmail, in fact!\nButz:\nGimme a break! It's a love letter! Haven't you ever been in love!?\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What did you just say!?\nButz:\nMy love for her burns so hotly, it could melt all the snow on this mountain!\nEdgeworth:\nO-Oh? Then what is this secret you mention!?\nButz:\nCome on, Edgey... Don't you get it? I'm talking about the secret love between her and me! Obviously she wouldn't want old lady Bikini to know about it, right...? About our... hot and sour... bittersweet love affair!\nEdgeworth:\n... Alright, then why did you send a love letter in a business-like manila envelope!?\nButz:\nGive me a break! It's not my fault I didn't have any other envelopes! Yeesh!\nGumshoe:\nThen why were you so quick to apologize, pal!?\nButz:\nIt's cuz Edgey gave me that scary look of his!\nEdgeworth:\n... ...\nButz:\nWhat's wrong, Edgey? Why are you so quiet all of a sudden?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's it? THAT'S what all those huge locks were about? (Changed from [That's it? That's all [sic] those huge locks were about?] in the original release) I-I don't understand why you were so defensive...\nButz:\nWell, I dunno either... I guess the thing is... ...you shouldn't expect too much from a guy like me. ...Hey, come on. Don't let it get you down!\nGumshoe:\n... B-But Mr. Edgeworth! This guy is still hiding something! I know it!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nDon't forget what this guy said just a minute ago!\n\n\nButz:\nIf you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible.\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm...

At around 10 o'clock last night, it started thundering. I'd been sleeping... I'm not sure for how long. Suddenly... ZING! The world in front of me went white!

Try drinking your hot water. If you don't drink it fast it's going to get cold.\nEdgeworth:\nOh, sorry... (It's cold alright... The water... And my evidence.)\nButz:\nWell? Have you calmed down yet?\nEdgeworth:\nUm, yes... I'm going to think it over again.\nButz:\nH-Hey, I'm telling you... there's nothing to think over! I was in my room doing \"she loves me, she loves me not\" with a bunch of flowers.\nLeads back to:\n\"As usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar.\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis is a map of the area. Take a look around the vicinity of Hazakura Temple.\nButz:\nWh-What am I looking for?\nEdgeworth:\nI think that should be fairly obvious. The Main Hall is surrounded by trees and it's impossible to see the bridge from here.\nButz:\nWhat...!? Why didn't you tell me that before!?\n\n1 LOCK BROKEN\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Well? How about it?\nButz:\nHow about what?\nEdgeworth:\nDo you feel like talking now?\nButz:\nAbout what?\nEdgeworth:\n... (It looks like it won't be that easy after all...) ...You leave me no choice. I'll have to move on to the next step. You weren't in your room at the temple. So then... Where were you?\nButz:\nY-Y-You don't know that I wasn't in my room!\nEdgeworth:\n(So where was Larry, and why was he there...? If I've read the situation up to this point correctly, the answer is fairly obvious.) ...Very well then. Let's test my theory. The place you witnessed lightning striking Dusky Bridge from was... here!\n\n\n\nPresent Heavenly Hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall!\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis is where you were! Well, what do you think, Larry!?\nButz:\nOh... Not much I guess.\nEdgeworth:\n... I'm sorry, but what kind of answer is that?\nButz:\nWell, you were just making small talk, right? Like \"How are you doing?\" or something.\nEdgeworth:\n...Larry. Look at the expression on my face. Do I look like I was just making small talk?\nButz:\nTo be honest? No... I guess not. Ha ha ha ha ha...\nEdgeworth:\n(It appears I didn't think it through carefully enough.)\nLeads back to:\n\"So where was Larry, and why was he there...?\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall!\nButz:\n...Wh-Why would I be hanging out in this old shack? It's freezing cold, there's no electricity, and it could fall apart at any minute...\nEdgeworth:\nLarry... How do you know that anyway? How do you know there's no electricity? After all, it's not that dark yet.\nButz:\nAh... Uh-oh!\nEdgeworth:\nIn other words, you have just provided evidence to prove my theory... My theory that you've at least once in your life visited Heavenly Hall after sunset!\n\n1 LOCK BROKEN\n\nButz:\nI have to admit I'm impressed, Edgey! You're in a totally different league from Nick.\nEdgeworth:\n...That's nice. Now tell me. What were you doing at this cold little shack last night?\nButz:\nThat's what you might call... A \"Fair de Core\".\nEdgeworth:\nI think you mean \"affaire de coeur\". Could it be you were... waiting for someone?\nButz:\nOoooh nooo! Y-You really are one scary guy, you know...\nEdgeworth:\nI believe that last night, you were waiting for this person to come meet you!\n\n\n\nPresent Iris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n \nEdgeworth:\n...Well, Larry!? Was it THIS person...?\nButz:\n...You know what? You should save your finger pointing for the courtroom.\nEdgeworth:\nTsk...!\nButz:\nIt's no wonder people call you a workaholic. You work too hard! You should be like me!\nEdgeworth:\n(Well, I'd rather \"work too hard\" than \"hardly work\" like a loafaholic like you...) In any case... I know you were waiting for someone!\nButz:\nYeah, but... It's like I said. It's an \"affaire de guerre\".\nEdgeworth:\nNo, Larry. You mean \"affaire de coeur\". At least I think you do.\nLeads back to:\n\"Could it be you were... waiting for someone?\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry.\nButz:\nI told you before... Don't call me \"Larry\"...\nEdgeworth:\nThe person you were waiting for was... Iris!\nButz:\nOhh... Suddenly I feel cold all over, Edgey.\nEdgeworth:\nNo doubt because of my chilly glare.\nButz:\nSo you think I got the hots for Sister Iris, huh...? D-Do you have some kind of evidence!? You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing?\nEdgeworth:\n(This is where I draw the line and end this ridiculous little game...)

I-Is it just me?\nEdgeworth:\nNow, I'm the one that suddenly feels cold...\nButz:\nMaybe it's because of my cold laugh?\nEdgeworth:\n(Grr... I hate making such stupid mistakes...)\nButz:\nDo you really have the evidence you say you do, Edgey?\nLeads back to:\n\"You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing?\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Here's your evidence. You called her to this spot with a pathetic blackmail letter!\nButz:\nOh! H-Hey! G-G-Give that back! You're embarrassing me! What are you doing with that anyway!?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's not important! ...I misjudged you, Larry.\nButz:\nWhat do you mean...?\nEdgeworth:\nTaking advantage of a woman's frailty like that! You should be ashamed of yourself!\nButz:\nOhhh... OHHHH!\nEdgeworth:\nFirst of all, what's this at the top of the letter? It says, \"Salutation here\"!\nButz:\nW-Well that's what it said in that book, \"Letter Writing for Dummies\"!\nEdgeworth:\nYou're not supposed to actually write that!

I'm just... hardly accustomed to that sort of thing.Edgeworth:\nWorry not... And in any case, whatever it was that he saw on the night of the incident... Mark my words, I will drag it out him!Iris:\nDoes that mean... Mr. Laurice is the witness today...?Edgeworth:\n...No. I believe that nun... will be the first to take the stand.Iris:\nSister Bikini...Edgeworth:\nShe claims to have seen the very instant in which you carried out the crime.Iris:\n...Edgeworth:\nI just want to ask you one last time. It really wasn't you who killed Ms. Elise Deauxnim, correct?Iris:\n... That is correct. It wasn't me.Edgeworth:\n...Very well, then.Iris:\nUm... Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\n...Yes?Iris:\nYou are a prosecutor... aren't you? Are you sure about this? If your true identity is revealed...Edgeworth:\nDon't worry. I've made the necessary arrangements. (Changed from [Don't worry. ...I've taken the necessary steps.] in the original release)Iris:\nI-I see... (Changed from [Y-You have...?] in the original release)Edgeworth:\n...Iris. It is a prosecutor's job to doubt people.Iris:\n...Edgeworth:\nBut right now... I am a defense attorney. A defense attorney's job is to believe in people, and to believe until the bitter end. That's what my friend told me once.

I leave my defense in your capable hands.February 9, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 7Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Sister Iris of Hazakura Temple.Edgeworth:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:\n...The defense does indeed appear to be ready... However, the same cannot be said for the prosecution in this case.Edgeworth:\n...Indeed.Judge:\nI'm not sure I like such blatant waste of this court's time. An empty prosecutor's chair can only mean... ...that the prosecutor has no confidence in their ability to prove their case. It would seem this case is already over before it had a chance to begin. I am ready to announce my verdict at this time. This court finds the defendant...???:???:\nThe prosecution... stands ready.Judge:\nA-And you are...?von Karma:\nFranziska von Karma... Prosecuting prodigy.Judge:\nV-Von Karma, you say...? Perchance, you wouldn't be of any relation to the legendary prosecutor Manfred von Karma?von Karma:\n... Legends are a thing of the past. I am a Von Karma. That is all. Upon a special request, I flew in today for the purposes of prosecuting this case.Judge:\nY-You did!? Then... you must be quite a big shot, eh! By the way, Mr. Edgeworth...Edgeworth:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nI'm almost certain that I've seen you somewhere before. Or am I just imagining things? You look very much like a prosecutor I met once...Edgeworth:\n...I believe you are imagining things, Your Honor.Judge:\nMs. von Karma? Do you have anything to say?von Karma:\n... There is no such weakling as this man among those of the Prosecutor's Office.Judge:\nThere... there isn't...? But I'm sure... once before, in this courtroom... Ack!von Karma:\n...I told you, there is no such weakling!Judge:\nWh-What is that!? A whip!? I'm not sure I care for such a thing in my courtroom! B-Bailiff! Remove that whip, at...Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\n...I have no objection to the whip.Judge:\nY-You don't...?Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution can wield a whip or drink seventeen cups of coffee... But there is still only one truth. That is what I stand here to prove today!von Karma:\nThis promises to be interesting... Miles Edgeworth. ...I had expected to face Phoenix Wright here today. But looking at you now... ...maybe this is what I have been waiting for all this time. Miles Edgeworth! I will not allow this chance to crush you slip through my fingers!Edgeworth:\n...I see you brought your flair for the histrionic.Judge:\nAllow me to add to the things I'm not sure about... People acting bizarrely in my court! Uwa-hah!von Karma:\n...The stage is set. Now continue with the proceedings, Your Honor.Judge:\nVery well. Ms. von Karma, please give an outline of this case. With as little whipping as possible!von Karma:\nThe murder victim is the famed picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Her body was found in the Hazakura Temple courtyard. She had been stabbed through the torso by a ceremonial sword from a golden statue.Judge:\nThe sword in this picture... is the weapon in question, correct...? ...Very well. The court accepts this photo of the crime scene.Crime Photo added to the Court Record.von Karma:\nThere is no mistake. This was the doing of Sister Iris. After all... there is a witness to her crime.Judge:\n...Very well. Please bring this witness to the stand!Edgeworth:\n(And so it begins... My first and my last trial... as a defense attorney!)von Karma:\n...Witness. State your name and occupation. Please.Judge:\nH-Hold on here! I'm not sure about being not sure if I care for this at all! Witness! Please stand up nice and straight!Edgeworth:\nIf I recall correctly... ...there are a few milk crates in the Defendant's Lobby for our back pain-plagued witness. (Changed from [...there are a few milk crates in the defendant's lobby for witnesses with bad backs.] in the original release)Judge:\nBailiff! Fetch a crate for this poor lady, please!von Karma:\n...Once again. Your name and occupation, please.Bikini:\nLittle old me? Well, I'm the head nun of Hazakura Temple on Eagle Mountain. My name is Bikini. You got it? Bikini. Nice to meet everyone.Judge:\n... But you don't appear to be wearing a bikini right now... Uwah!von Karma:\n...The courtroom is the garden of holy judgment. Those with lechery in their hearts should leave this sanctuary at once!Judge:\nY-You want me to leave!?Bikini:\nNo need to get your bikinis in a twist! Let me tell you, I'm a sight to behold in summer! Wha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha!Edgeworth:\nIn any case... Witness. I hear that you saw the crime take place on the night in question.Bikini:\nThat's right! I can still hardly believe it myself, to be honest. There's no way dear little Iris could do anything like that...Judge:\nLet us hear what you have to say then. First, tell us aboot your own movements that night, eh!Witness Testimony-- The Night of the Murder --Bikini:\nThat night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But...\nWell, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently.\nSo, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.\nThere's no bath at the Inner Temple, you see, and I needed a long, hot soak.\nIt was after I had finished, just as I was heading back... that's when I saw it!Judge:\nHmm... So it was simply coincidence that you found yourself returning to Hazakura Temple?Bikini:\n...Yes, you could say that. If my back hadn't been in so much pain, I would have stayed at the Inner Temple.Edgeworth:\n(That sounds like a pretty important statement she just made...)von Karma:\nThere is only one problem with this testimony that I can see... And you're not about to fall at the first hurdle, now are you, Miles Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth. ...Please begin your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- The Night of the Murder --Bikini:\nThat night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this Inner Temple...?\nBikini:\nWell, see, conversing with the spirits is what we train people to do, right?\nJudge:\nWe'll be the ones asking you the questions, madam.\nBikini:\n...In order to do that, a place strong in spiritual power is required. There's a small temple across Dusky Bridge, called the Inner Temple.  Acolytes must spend an entire night there to undergo intense training.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd how exactly do you help with this process...?\nBikini:\nIt is all quite exacting. It can't be performed without a nun supervising.\nvon Karma:\nLike a tutor, watching to make sure a spoiled child studies.\nEdgeworth:\n(A tutor with a whip, in your case.) If that is the case... ...then why did you return to Hazakura Temple, where the murder took place?Bikini:\nWell, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nViolently...?\nBikini:\nThat's right. It's no laughing matter, especially in winter! I can't hold anything heavier than a knife and fork during the cold months! Just being alive is like strict training! Wah ha ha! Wha ha! Wah ha ha!\nEdgeworth:\nOn the night of the murder, was this fabulous back of yours hurting again...?\nBikini:\nThat's right. Raging like a bull in a pigpen. I almost fainted once or twice! I just knew that unless I warmed it up, it was going to finally finish me off!Bikini:\nSo, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou \"left Iris to help\"... With what?\nBikini:\nWhat do you think? The acolyte's training, of course. It was just past 10 PM, so we were starting to enter into the training exercises proper.\nJudge:\nWasn't it your place to remain with the disciple?\nBikini:\nWell, the job is simply to watch over the acolyte so that they don't pass away.\nEdgeworth:\nJust to confirm this point again, that night... ...you met Iris in the Inner Temple, correct?\nBikini:\nYes, yes. She's a gentle, honest girl. She's never once failed to follow my directions.Present Iris's Testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Witnesses have to undergo their own trials, I'm afraid. The defendant's fate rests on their powers of observation and memory, after all.\nBikini:\nWell, well, well. Don't worry! I'm more than up to the task! I'm a woman of faith, after all. The head honcho of Hazakura Temple.\nEdgeworth:\nIn that case, Ms. Honcho... I'd like you to explain something for me. The discrepancy between your testimony and that of the defendant, Iris. She claims that after ringing the lights out bell, she went back and stayed in her room. ...Which means! She did not go to the Inner Temple at all!\nBikini:\nN... No...! She said that...?\nvon Karma:\n\nvon Karma:\nA defendant or a witness... Who is more likely to lie, do you suppose? The defendant is simply lying to cover her back!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nBut that is completely illogical. The murder was committed in the courtyard of Hazakura Temple. Claiming that she \"went to the Inner Temple\" would make for a much better alibi.\nvon Karma:\n...!\nBikini:\nBut that is odd... Whatever the reason... I can't believe that she would lie...!\nJudge:\nHmm... she does indeed have honest eyes! Uwaaaah!\nvon Karma:\n...All people lie. That is my belief.\nJudge:\nWhy am I the only one being whipped in here...!? Anyway! Neither the witness nor the defendant have any reason to lie! Which means... We must call your memory into question...\nBikini:\nDear, dear, dear. You're older than me and yet you want to play that game, do you?\nJudge:\nA-Ah, well, that isn't exactly what I...\nBikini:\nMy memory is perfect! Crystal clear! Especially in winter!\nJudge:\nThen... I suppose it's too early to end this cross-examination, eh. Mr. Edgeworth. If you are going to question the memory of this witness... ...you will need to show me a more decisive piece of evidence.\nEdgeworth:\n...Understood, Your Honor. (I was naïve to think that alone would do the trick.)\nJudge:\nThen please add your comments aboot Iris to the testimony... And let us return to the cross-examination.\nChanges statement from \"So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.\" to \"Iris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner.\"Bikini:\nIris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nAre you sure that you're not making a mistake...?\nBikini:\n...You, young man, need to get your estimation of me up from the floor!\nEdgeworth:\nNngh...!\nBikini:\nIris always wears the same clothes. The smallest thing out of place would have stood out like a sore thumb to me! You're making a mistake, thinking I made a mistake!\nJudge:\n...An excellent finish there, witness.\nEdgeworth:\n(Still, I have to wonder...)Present Iris's Hood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...Witness. Let's get one thing straight.\"Bikini:\nThere's no bath at the Inner Temple, you see, and I needed a long, hot soak.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...So you returned to the Hazakura Temple in order to take a bath?\nBikini:\nMy back is to blame for everything. It's a \"do or be done in\" kind of world, after all.\nEdgeworth:\nHow long were you in the bath for, if you don't mind me asking?\nBikini:\n... My my my, what a filthy little rogue you are! I know what's on your mind!\nEdgeworth:\n...?\nBikini:\nI bet your next question is going to be, \"Where exactly did you wash?\" Ah, THIS is why you have to watch the young ones...\nEdgeworth:\nW-What are you going on about!? I was... Gwah!\nvon Karma:\n...Pathetic, Miles Edgeworth.\nJudge:\nThe lowest of the low.\nEdgeworth:\n(Is there some sort of \"Kick Me\" sign stuck to the defense's bench!?)\nBikini:\nAnyway, I couldn't afford to be away from my post for too long, you understand, so...Bikini:\nIt was after I had finished, just as I was heading back... that's when I saw it!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe crime took place in the courtyard, correct...?\nBikini:\nWhen you go from my room to the Main Hall... ...you have to take a winding hallway from which you can see the courtyard.\nvon Karma:\nThat's right. In other words... ...it was pure coincidence that the witness saw the crime taking place before her eyes. There was no complicated set-up in this case!\nJudge:\nHmm... That certainly seems to be true.Edgeworth:\n(There is indeed only one problem with this testimony. If I can clearly point out what it is, then I can begin to quantify... ...just how good this witness's memory and observation skills are.)Edgeworth:\n...Witness. Let's get one thing straight. The defendant whom you claim to have met... ...she was wearing this \"Demon-Warding Hood\", correct?Bikini:\nOf course! That is a very important piece of clothing, I'll have you know! Wha ha ha! Wha ha ha! Ha ha... Wait a minute...von Karma:von Karma:\nH-Hold it right there! Why do you have that...!?Edgeworth:\nThat's the question of the day, now isn't it... Ms. von Karma? I'll have you know that this hood was given to someone as a gift that night. Before the lights out bell was rung.von Karma:\nW... What!?Edgeworth:\n...You know where I'm going with this, don't you? If the witness had seen the defendant as she claims... ...then the Iris she saw should have been missing this very hood! (Changed from [...the defendant couldn't have been wearing this very hood!] in the original release)Bikini:\nWell well well!Edgeworth:\n(It's not a bad feeling at all, exposing contradictions like this... Now I understand that happy look on Wright's face every time he does it...)Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Witness, your response... Wuahaaa!von Karma:\n...Sister. This hood... You have spare ones around the temple, don't you?Bikini:\nSpares... Well... I do tend to make too many of them.Judge:\nI see... A stockpile. A surplus of hoods, eh?Bikini:\nEach nun is only given one hood. This should be the only hood that Iris owned...Judge:\nHmm... Then this is quite strange! Waaaah!von Karma:\nIf there was a surplus of hoods, then she could have worn one of those! ...There is no contradiction here!Judge:\nHmm...Edgeworth:\n(I'm sorry to break this to you, Ms. von Karma... but you won't get away that easily. Discrepancies such as this will sow seeds in any human heart. The seeds of doubt.)Judge:\n...Witness. While I don't wish to call your testimony into doubt... ...you must give every detail with precision.Bikini:\nI-I'm not sure I'm comfortable going along with this...von Karma:\nSister. You shall continue with your testimony. Tell us what you saw after finishing your bath, on your way back to the Inner Temple!Edgeworth:\n(Those seeds of doubt are sprouting in the judge's heart. They just need a little more stimulation to bear fruit... Contradictory stimulation.)Witness Testimony-- After My Bath --Bikini:\nI finished my bath around 11, and I thought I should return to the Inner Temple.\nAnd as I was walking back... I heard a noise from the courtyard. I took a look and...\nIris was...! Oh, Mystic Elise! And with that sword, of all things!\nMystic Elise was staying in the corner room, which faces out onto the courtyard.\nThe stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window.Judge:\nYou saw a truly terrible sight, didn't you...? If I was in your place... ...then it would be much like Ms. von Karma whipping Mr. Edgeworth in two in court! And me, seeing it all from this very chair! ...Er, well, something like that.Edgeworth:\n(This judge... His imagination is about as vivid and creative as Detective Gumshoe...)von Karma:\nI would look the fool if I commented on such foolishness. Anyway, this case is mine... Miles Edgeworth!Edgeworth:\nCalling everyone by their full name... Can't you do something about that habit of yours?Cross Examination-- After My Bath --Bikini:\nI finished my bath around 11, and I thought I should return to the Inner Temple.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...How far is it from your room to the Inner Temple?\nBikini:\nLet me think a moment... About twenty minutes, on these stumps of mine. It's about 15 minutes to Dusky Bridge from Hazakura Temple. The Inner Temple is just beyond the bridge.\nvon Karma:\nStill, you never made it back there that night, did you?\nBikini:\nT-That's right... I was heading along the walkway toward the Main Hall...Bikini:\nAnd as I was walking back... I heard a noise from the courtyard. I took a look and...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou say you heard a noise...?\nBikini:\n\"Thump\"... Just like that.\nvon Karma:\n...That could only be the sound of the victim falling.\nBikini:\nIt's very quiet in the temple, you know. You can even hear the snow falling from the branches. \"Thump\"... Just like that.\nJudge:\nBut then, couldn't this noise you heard have been snow falling to the ground?\nBikini:\n... I never thought of that. Wah ha ha. Wha ha ha. Ha ha...\nJudge:\nHoh hoh. Hoh hoh. Hoh hoh... Uaaaaaah!\nvon Karma:\nThe next one to laugh gets a whipping!\nBikini:\nWell. Whatever the source of the sound, I looked over at the courtyard and...Bikini:\nIris was...! Oh, Mystic Elise! And with that sword, of all things!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...This is the second time that the witness has testified to seeing the defendant. But... some doubt remains in these claims.\nBikini:\nHey, just what does that mean!? Just because you're a good-looking young man doesn't give you the right to...\nEdgeworth:\nThe murderer who stabbed the victim with the sword... Sister Bikini, try to recall exactly who it was you saw! As clearly as you can!\nBikini:\nHmm... Well. You're a handsome young man, so I'll forgive you. ... Oh! Now that you mention it... There was something awfully strange about her... Something that has been bugging me all this time!\nEdgeworth:\n...Please, don't keep us in suspense.\nBikini:\nHer hood!\nvon Karma:\nHer hood...?\nBikini:\nThat's right! ...It's coming back to me... Iris... She wasn't wearing her hood! I thought something was out of place, but... It all makes sense now, doesn't it? After all, she'd given that hood away to someone, right?\nEdgeworth:\n...Urk!\nvon Karma:\nHah... You've dug your own grave, Miles Edgeworth!\nJudge:\nWhat do you say, Mr. Edgeworth? Is this testimony important?\n\n\n\nIt's not important\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(...This line of questioning is only going to tear the  wound open further.) These statements are as useless as the investigations of a certain detective. ...There is no need to record them.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nJudge:\nVery well. ...Please, continue with your testimony.\nvon Karma:\nHmph...\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nIt's important\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(This may initially appear to put me at a disadvantage... But, I can't see any other leads at the moment...) ...Your Honor. I would like these new statements to be added to the testimony.\nvon Karma:\nHeh... Miles Edgeworth.\nvon Karma:\nIf you want to hang yourself, you need only to ask. I'll gladly lend you my whip!\nJudge:\nWitness. Add that statement to your testimony.\nBikini:\n...No problem.\nAdds statement \"Now that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on.\"Bikini:\nNow that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou are sure about that...?\nBikini:\nYes. After all, we always wear the same clothes. Ah! I don't mean because we're poor, you understand? It's our style. Yes, that's it!\nEdgeworth:\n...There's absolutely no need to explain yourself.\nBikini:\nAnyway! She looked different from normal, so that really stuck out.\nvon Karma:\nLike me holding a whippet puppy instead of my whip.\nEdgeworth:\n(At least then it might bite you and not someone else...)\nBikini:\nIris didn't have her hood on. I'm sure of it!\nJudge:\n...Very well. Now, please tell us aboot the victim, eh.Bikini:\nMystic Elise was staying in the corner room, which faces out onto the courtyard.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe room the victim was staying in overlooked the courtyard, correct?\nJudge:\nWhich means... the victim's room was on the second floor?\nBikini:\nNo, no. Hazakura Temple is a single story building. But the mountain itself slopes downward... ...which elevates the Main Gate side of the temple and the guest rooms in the back... ...to about the height of a two story building.\nJudge:\nI see... And the victim was staying in one of these elevated rooms, correct?\nBikini:\nYes... I should know. I'm the one who carried her things to her room, after all...Bikini:\nThe stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat makes you so sure of all this...?\nBikini:\nIt's just like I told you earlier... \"I heard a noise from the courtyard.\" OK? \"Thump\"... Just like that.\nvon Karma:\nYou're one smart sister, I'll give you that. The autopsy report states that... ...the victim's body was covered in bruises... ...indicating a fall from around 10 feet in height.\nJudge:\nHmm... It appears that the witness was not mistaken then.\nBikini:\nYep. Yep. I'm more than just a pretty face. Especially in winter! I'm a woman of faith, after all. The head honcho of Hazakura Temple.\nEdgeworth:\n(There's only two of them working there...!)\nvon Karma:\nWhat's wrong, Miles Edgeworth? No snappy comeback remark?\nEdgeworth:\n...Present Elise's Autopsy Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...Impressive logic. That's what I'd like to say, anyway.\"Edgeworth:\n(...It doesn't feel like she is lying. This is very powerful testimony, too. She claims to have seen the instant in which the defendant stabbed the victim... There are only two things I can believe in right now... My client, Iris, and my own abilities as a defense attorney.)Edgeworth:\n...Impressive logic. That's what I'd like to say, anyway.Bikini:\nOh please, do! My brain is something else... especially in winter!Edgeworth:\nHowever... I think you are overlooking one thing. ...Ms. von Karma. Would you be so kind as to take another look at the autopsy report?von Karma:\nT-The autopsy report...?Edgeworth:\nThe victim did fall from a height of 10 feet. ...However. This fall... was after she was killed.von Karma:\nAh...!Judge:\nT-That's right! It says \"after death\" right here!Edgeworth:\nThe scene the witness claims to have seen is contradictory! If the defendant stabbed and killed the victim there in the courtyard... ...how did the victim then go on to take a ten foot fall!?von Karma:\nAaah!Judge:\nO-Order! Order! The victim was killed and then fell! If that is the case... ...then the victim must have been killed in her room... Don't you agree?von Karma:\nTh-That is the logical conclusion... Yes, that's right! The victim must have been stabbed by the defendant in her own room! And she was then thrown out of her window down into the courtyard below!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nWere there any signs of a struggle in Ms. Deauxnim's room...?von Karma:\n...!Edgeworth:\nShe was stabbed with a sword! That would leave a blood stain, wouldn't you agree?Judge:\nW-Well, Ms. von Karma? Was there any blood...? Waaaaaah!von Karma:\n...No traces of blood were found in the victim's room.Judge:\n...Your whip has just caused traces of blood to be found on my glorious playoff beard. However! If there was no blood in the room, then your claim that... Waaaaah!von Karma:\nI'm sure there's no need for me to go over this... ...as I'm sure Your Honor is well aware... ...of when a stab wound produces the most blood.Judge:\nWhen it produces the most blood...?von Karma:\nVery little blood is actually lost at the moment of a blade's insertion. If you want to talk about when the most blood would be lost from a body... ...that would be when the blade is removed.Edgeworth:\nIndeed. With the weapon still in place... ...it acts like a lid on the wound.Judge:\nThat's true... With the weapon still in the body, there wouldn't be much bleeding... A perfectly reasonable line of thinking!von Karma:\nWe have come to a conclusion then! The victim was thrown out of the window with the sword still in place... This removes all of the contradictions!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! I must admit that this is a probable version of events!Edgeworth:\n(I'd expect no less from Franziska von Karma... She locates and takes control of every vital point!)von Karma:\n...Hmph...Judge:\nIt seems... ...that we need a clearer testimony from the witness. Remove all supposition on your part and tell us only the truth, please! Witness! Please! Remain standing on the crate!Bikini:\nDon't go selling me short now! The weight of winter snow has bent me out of shape! ...Especially my back and my mood!von Karma:\nSister. Please, give us your testimony. I will give you a vigorous massage once we are finished here.Edgeworth:\n(...With the whip?)Bikini:\n...Oh, boy. Alright, alright...Witness Testimony-- Further Details --Bikini:\nWhen I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place.\nThinking about it now, I didn't actually see her stab Mystic Elise.\nI've never seen so much blood before...\nThat's when I fainted. You can't blame me, can you?\nAnd when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back!Judge:\nHmm... This all confirms Ms. von Karma's theory...von Karma:\nVon Karmas strive for nothing but perfection. Putting together such facts is nothing for me! You should know that, Miles Edgeworth!Edgeworth:\n(\"Perfection\" is an impossibility, Franziska von Karma... And I'm here to teach you just that...)Cross Examination-- Further Details --Bikini:\nWhen I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nAt that time... was the victim bleeding?\nBikini:\nWell... I was very shocked to be seeing all this, of course... So I'm not entirely sure... But I don't think I saw any blood. Not then.\nvon Karma:\n...I'm sure that you didn't. The weapon was acting as a plug in the wound.\nEdgeworth:\nIn any case... Let's be clear on one very important point. Did you actually see the instant in which the victim was stabbed!?Bikini:\nThinking about it now, I didn't actually see her stab Mystic Elise.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Think carefully. This is very important.\nBikini:\nIt's Iris we are talking about here! I'm thinking for all I'm worth! ... No, when I looked over, the sword was already in Mystic Elise's body.\nJudge:\nHmmmmmm...\nEdgeworth:\n(It might not be  conclusive, but... ...this testimony supports her theory.)\nvon Karma:\nThe victim was stabbed in her room and then dropped into the courtyard... ...I think this proves it rather well, Miles Edgeworth.Bikini:\nI saw the instant in which the blade, plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n\"Smoothly\", you say... You're saying you saw the sword smoothly slide out?\nBikini:\nThat's right...\nBikini:\nThe whole thing happened right next to the gold statue of Mystic Ami. Mystic Elise was on the ground, and Iris was stooped over her. The sword was buried up to the hilt. When Iris stood up, the sword in her hand just slid out of Mystic Elise's body. It slid out from that gaping wound...! Aaaah...\nJudge:\nIt goes without saying... that if the sword was removed there would be bleeding.\nvon Karma:\n...Nothing out of place here.\nEdgeworth:\n(Is that really the case...? I can't help but feel that something about this testimony is very out of place... That something which couldn't possibly have happened... appears to have happened.)Present Shichishito\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Sister Bikini. You are a reliable witness...\"Bikini:\nI've never seen so much blood before...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...So you're saying that you saw the victim's blood?\nBikini:\nT-That's right! Some of it had splattered onto Iris, too...\nvon Karma:\nWhen the defendant was arrested, she was meditating in her room. And her blood-flecked clothing was neatly folded in the corner.\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What!? (Her clothes were blood-flecked as well...?)\nJudge:\nHmmm... That seems quite conclusive to me...\nEdgeworth:\n(What should I do...? Press this point further?)\n\n\n\nStop here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I can't afford to make things look any worse for the defendant. I'll bide my time for now.)\nJudge:\n...Witness. Please continue your testimony. From after you witnessed the victim bleeding!\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nGoing back to your previous statement... ...you said that you saw little bleeding when the victim was stabbed. But now... you say you saw the victim bleeding...?\nBikini:\nWell, well. I say that what I saw is what I saw.\nJudge:\nW-What did you see?\nBikini:\nMaybe I didn't see the poor woman get stabbed... But I saw the girl pull the sword out of her, plain as day.\nEdgeworth:\nPulling the sword out...?\nBikini:\nWell, it wasn't exactly pulling... It was more like it \"came out\".\nJudge:\nWitness! You will add this statement to your testimony!\nBikini:\nOh... Was that important...!?\nEdgeworth:\n(More important than you can imagine...)\nAdds statement \"I saw the instant in which the blade, plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out.\"Press (after adding statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWas the bleeding caused by the killer removing the sword...?\nBikini:\nNo mistaking it! I remember it all, clear as day!\nEdgeworth:\n...Don't you think that's a bit odd?\nvon Karma:\nWhat do you mean, Miles Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nWhy would the killer pull out the sword?\nvon Karma:\nWhat...?\nEdgeworth:\nIf all she wanted to do was place the weapon in the hand of the gold statue... ...then there was no reason to remove it from the body. All that would've accomplished is causing the victim to bleed unnecessarily. ...Your thoughts, Ms. von Karma?\nvon Karma:\nT-That's...\nJudge:\nIndeed... It is strange, now that you mention it.\nEdgeworth:\n(I'm going to need to find an answer to this mystery, too...)\nvon Karma:\nA-Anyway! The witness saw something terrible! ...So what did you do after that, witness?Bikini:\nThat's when I fainted. You can't blame me, can you?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nNow, on to what the killer did next... You saw none of it? Correct?\nBikini:\nWell... I was unconscious...\nvon Karma:\nHow long were you out for?\nBikini:\nI don't know... 10, maybe 20 minutes...? A young man with a very prickly looking head woke me up. ...By stepping on me, actually.\nJudge:\nHmm... I'm not sure I like that method of resuscitation!\nBikini:\nWell, I wasn't asking for mouth-to-mouth, or anything of the sort... ...but I would've welcomed a more gentle awakening right about then, let me tell you.\nEdgeworth:\n...I shall have words with the offender personally. What did you see upon awakening...?Bikini:\nAnd when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nBy \"Mystic Ami\", you are referring to the golden statue, correct?\nBikini:\nJust stabbing someone with the Shichishito, a sacred treasure, is terrible enough.\nBikini:\nBut to then make Mystic Ami hold the blade...!\nvon Karma:\nTruly, a heinous, despicable crime.\nEdgeworth:\nIt is easy to despise something. Anyone can do it. However, there is something that cannot be done so easily...\nvon Karma:\nWhatever it is, I'm sure it's doubly hard for you. Anyway, what is the problem?\nEdgeworth:\nExactly why would the killer set up this gruesome scene? Can anyone explain the reasoning behind that?\nvon Karma:\n...!\nJudge:\nHmmmmm... No, I don't think I can.\nvon Karma:\n... There isn't always a logical reason behind why someone acts!\nBikini:\nThat's true, so true. In early spring, for example, I often find myself...\nEdgeworth:\n(\"There isn't always\"... That phrase might come in handy someday.)Edgeworth:\n(There are too many unnatural elements in this case... Why was it necessary to use the Shichishito from the Ami statue as a weapon? Why was the weapon finally placed back in the hand of the statue? If I can expose the flaws in this testimony, perhaps then I will begin to find the truth.)Edgeworth:\nSister Bikini. You are a reliable witness... At least, I'd like to think so. But there are too many contradictions here.Bikini:\nW-What do you mean? You make it sound as though I'm a liar! But... You're a handsome young man, so I'll forgive you.von Karma:\nWhat contradictions are you talking about?Edgeworth:\nIn the scene that the witness claims to have seen... ...the weapon was thrust up to its hilt into the victim. Furthermore... the killer withdrew the weapon smoothly from the body. ...However! Both of these are complete impossibilities!Judge:\nWhat do you mean...? Please, explain you... Uwaaaaah!von Karma:\nExplain yourself!Edgeworth:\nTo start with... Do you think it would be possible to stab someone to the hilt with this? No matter how I look at the defendant, she doesn't appear strong enough for that.von Karma:von Karma:\n\"Doesn't appear\"...? What meaningless dribble! I, too, may appear to be weak and frail... But I can crush men under my heel and make them weep, should I so choose!Judge:\nThe objection stands! I wept a little back there, I must admit.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\n...That isn't the only issue here. If this sword was truly stabbed into the body up to the hilt... Well, just look at all the branches on it. It certainly wouldn't come out smoothly.von Karma:\nT-That's...Edgeworth:\nWe also have the problem of the amount of bleeding. It's true that when a blade is left in a body, it acts as a \"plug\" of sorts. However! When the weapon is shaped like this, it's an entirely different story. The wound would be too large for the blade to completely stop from bleeding!von Karma:von Karma:\nT-That's nothing more than conjecture! In reality, the victim was stabbed with the Shichishito. Even a weapon of this nature... ...may still sometimes slide out smoothly, and may still sometimes stop the blood loss!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nI'm not finished. There is still one more... conclusive contradiction.Judge:\nY-You've still got more!?Edgeworth:\n...This one is simple. If this sword really was thrust in all the way to the hilt... ...why is there only blood on the tip of it?von Karma:\nAh...!Edgeworth:\nIf this witness is telling the truth... Then there should be blood along the entire length of the sword!von Karma:\nNoooooo!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Ord-- Whaaaaaaaa!von Karma:\nBravo... Miles Edgeworth. Raising this many contradictions from a single piece of evidence! All the other attorneys I know could maybe manage one, if that!Judge:\nBut what does this all mean!? You have proven contradictions regarding the murder weapon, but...Edgeworth:\n...Having come this far, there can only be one answer.von Karma:\nAnd that is...?Edgeworth:\nThe weapon used to kill the victim... ...was not the Shichishito!Judge:\nW-Whaaaaaaaaat!?von Karma:\nA foolishly foolish idea born from the foolish mind of a foolhardy foolish fool.Edgeworth:\nLet's examine this again. What was it that made us think this sword was the murder weapon?Bikini:\nW-Well... It's because Mystic Ami was holding it...Edgeworth:\n...Exactly. However! If you reflect on this, that is the only basis we have to assume such a thing. The impression left by the scene was just too strong. That is what influenced us. It influenced us to believe that the Shichishito was the murder weapon!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! Waaaaaaaaah!von Karma:\nSo maybe the Shichishito was not the murder weapon. Even if that is the case... it changes nothing, Miles Edgeworth! The Sister here saw everything! She saw the defendant stab the victim with a sword-like object.Judge:\nHmmmmmm... That's true! Your response, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\n... If that is so... I would like the prosecution to answer the obvious question it raises.Judge:\nThe obvious... question?Edgeworth:\n...Yes. Namely... Where did the real murder weapon disappear to?von Karma:\n...!Edgeworth:\nIt goes without saying that the police searched the Main Hall and the surrounding area. ...Perhaps the prosecution can enlighten us as to if a \"sword-like object\" was found.von Karma:\nT-That's...Judge:\nAnswer the question, Ms. von Karma!von Karma:\n... No evidence of that kind was found.Judge:\nHmmmmm... Another mystery to throw onto the pile! A trial without a murder weapon is a tricky beast!Bikini:\nExcuse me... Could I say something...? I just remembered something, actually...von Karma:\n...What is it, Sister?Bikini:\nI was just thinking... It's possible... ...that just maybe... what actually happened was... it was just over there...Judge:\n... What exactly are you going on aboot here?Bikini:\nThe murder weapon, I mean! Maybe... I think I might know where the sword was disposed of!Edgeworth:\nYou what!?von Karma:\nWell then... I think we need to hear testimony from you one more time, Sister.Edgeworth:\n(Impossible...! What else... What else could this old woman have seen!?)Witness Testimony-- Location of the Weapon --Bikini:\nI saw the murder at around 11 PM...\nAnd after asking that it be reported, I went out to the Main Gate.\nAnd there... I saw tracks! Tracks that indicated the snowmobile had been used!\nIt takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, but less than 5 using one of those!\nMaybe they threw the weapon into Eagle River and came back while I was knocked out?\n...Iris could have done that. She can drive a snowmobile after all...Judge:\nHmmmmmm... Witness. Please, tell us everything you know right away next time.Bikini:\nWell. I'm not in the best of shape. What with my back and my age, you know.von Karma:\nQuite... There were indeed snowmobile tracks in front of the Main Gate. Here is a photograph.Judge:\nA snowmobile, eh... I see. Well, it certainly is an interesting theory...von Karma:\nThe tracks begin in front of Hazakura Temple... ...and run all the way to Dusky Bridge!Tracks Photo added to the Court Record.von Karma:\n...That solves your pesky little problem, yes? The Eagle River's current is quite swift, meaning that it doesn't freeze over in winter. Making it the perfect place to dispose of the murder weapon!Edgeworth:\n(Did she really go to the river to dispose of the murder weapon...?)Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth! ...Your cross-examination, please.Cross Examination",

    "newContext": "-- Further Details --Bikini:\nWhen I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nAt that time... was the victim bleeding?\nBikini:\nWell... I was very shocked to be seeing all this, of course... So I'm not entirely sure... But I don't think I saw any blood. Not then.\nvon Karma:\n...I'm sure that you didn't. The weapon was acting as a plug in the wound.\nEdgeworth:\nIn any case... Let's be clear on one very important point. Did you actually see the instant in which the victim was stabbed!?Bikini:\nThinking about it now, I didn't actually see her stab Mystic Elise.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Think carefully. This is very important.\nBikini:\nIt's Iris we are talking about here! I'm thinking for all I'm worth! ... No, when I looked over, the sword was already in Mystic Elise's body.\nJudge:\nHmmmmmm...\nEdgeworth:\n(It might not be  conclusive, but... ...this testimony supports her theory.)\nvon Karma:\nThe victim was stabbed in her room and then dropped into the courtyard... ...I think this proves it rather well, Miles Edgeworth.Bikini:\nI saw the instant in which the blade, plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n\"Smoothly\", you say... You're saying you saw the sword smoothly slide out?\nBikini:\nThat's right...\nBikini:\nThe whole thing happened right next to the gold statue of Mystic Ami. Mystic Elise was on the ground, and Iris was stooped over her. The sword was buried up to the hilt. When Iris stood up, the sword in her hand just slid out of Mystic Elise's body. It slid out from that gaping wound...! Aaaah...\nJudge:\nIt goes without saying... that if the sword was removed there would be bleeding.\nvon Karma:\n...Nothing out of place here.\nEdgeworth:\n(Is that really the case...? I can't help but feel that something about this testimony is very out of place... That something which couldn't possibly have happened... appears to have happened.)Present Shichishito\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Sister Bikini. You are a reliable witness...\"Bikini:\nI've never seen so much blood before...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...So you're saying that you saw the victim's blood?\nBikini:\nT-That's right! Some of it had splattered onto Iris, too...\nvon Karma:\nWhen the defendant was arrested, she was meditating in her room. And her blood-flecked clothing was neatly folded in the corner.\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What!? (Her clothes were blood-flecked as well...?)\nJudge:\nHmmm... That seems quite conclusive to me...\nEdgeworth:\n(What should I do...? Press this point further?)\n\n\n\nStop here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I can't afford to make things look any worse for the defendant. I'll bide my time for now.)\nJudge:\n...Witness. Please continue your testimony. From after you witnessed the victim bleeding!\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nGoing back to your previous statement... ...you said that you saw little bleeding when the victim was stabbed. But now... you say you saw the victim bleeding...?\nBikini:\nWell, well. I say that what I saw is what I saw.\nJudge:\nW-What did you see?\nBikini:\nMaybe I didn't see the poor woman get stabbed... But I saw the girl pull the sword out of her, plain as day.\nEdgeworth:\nPulling the sword out...?\nBikini:\nWell, it wasn't exactly pulling... It was more like it \"came out\".\nJudge:\nWitness! You will add this statement to your testimony!\nBikini:\nOh... Was that important...!?\nEdgeworth:\n(More important than you can imagine...)\nAdds statement \"I saw the instant in which the blade, plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out.\"Press (after adding statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWas the bleeding caused by the killer removing the sword...?\nBikini:\nNo mistaking it! I remember it all, clear as day!\nEdgeworth:\n...Don't you think that's a bit odd?\nvon Karma:\nWhat do you mean, Miles Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nWhy would the killer pull out the sword?\nvon Karma:\nWhat...?\nEdgeworth:\nIf all she wanted to do was place the weapon in the hand of the gold statue... ...then there was no reason to remove it from the body. All that would've accomplished is causing the victim to bleed unnecessarily. ...Your thoughts, Ms. von Karma?\nvon Karma:\nT-That's...\nJudge:\nIndeed... It is strange, now that you mention it.\nEdgeworth:\n(I'm going to need to find an answer to this mystery, too...)\nvon Karma:\nA-Anyway! The witness saw something terrible! ...So what did you do after that, witness?Bikini:\nThat's when I fainted. You can't blame me, can you?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nNow, on to what the killer did next... You saw none of it? Correct?\nBikini:\nWell... I was unconscious...\nvon Karma:\nHow long were you out for?\nBikini:\nI don't know... 10, maybe 20 minutes...? A young man with a very prickly looking head woke me up. ...By stepping on me, actually.\nJudge:\nHmm... I'm not sure I like that method of resuscitation!\nBikini:\nWell, I wasn't asking for mouth-to-mouth, or anything of the sort... ...but I would've welcomed a more gentle awakening right about then, let me tell you.\nEdgeworth:\n...I shall have words with the offender personally. What did you see upon awakening...?Bikini:\nAnd when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nBy \"Mystic Ami\", you are referring to the golden statue, correct?\nBikini:\nJust stabbing someone with the Shichishito, a sacred treasure, is terrible enough.\nBikini:\nBut to then make Mystic Ami hold the blade...!\nvon Karma:\nTruly, a heinous, despicable crime.\nEdgeworth:\nIt is easy to despise something. Anyone can do it. However, there is something that cannot be done so easily...\nvon Karma:\nWhatever it is, I'm sure it's doubly hard for you. Anyway, what is the problem?\nEdgeworth:\nExactly why would the killer set up this gruesome scene? Can anyone explain the reasoning behind that?\nvon Karma:\n...!\nJudge:\nHmmmmm... No, I don't think I can.\nvon Karma:\n... There isn't always a logical reason behind why someone acts!\nBikini:\nThat's true, so true. In early spring, for example, I often find myself...\nEdgeworth:\n(\"There isn't always\"... That phrase might come in handy someday.)Edgeworth:\n(There are too many unnatural elements in this case... Why was it necessary to use the Shichishito from the Ami statue as a weapon? Why was the weapon finally placed back in the hand of the statue? If I can expose the flaws in this testimony, perhaps then I will begin to find the truth.)Edgeworth:\nSister Bikini. You are a reliable witness... At least, I'd like to think so. But there are too many contradictions here.Bikini:\nW-What do you mean? You make it sound as though I'm a liar! But... You're a handsome young man, so I'll forgive you.von Karma:\nWhat contradictions are you talking about?Edgeworth:\nIn the scene that the witness claims to have seen... ...the weapon was thrust up to its hilt into the victim. Furthermore... the killer withdrew the weapon smoothly from the body. ...However! Both of these are complete impossibilities!Judge:\nWhat do you mean...? Please, explain you... Uwaaaaah!von Karma:\nExplain yourself!Edgeworth:\nTo start with... Do you think it would be possible to stab someone to the hilt with this? No matter how I look at the defendant, she doesn't appear strong enough for that.von Karma:von Karma:\n\"Doesn't appear\"...? What meaningless dribble! I, too, may appear to be weak and frail... But I can crush men under my heel and make them weep, should I so choose!Judge:\nThe objection stands! I wept a little back there, I must admit.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\n...That isn't the only issue here. If this sword was truly stabbed into the body up to the hilt... Well, just look at all the branches on it. It certainly wouldn't come out smoothly.von Karma:\nT-That's...Edgeworth:\nWe also have the problem of the amount of bleeding. It's true that when a blade is left in a body, it acts as a \"plug\" of sorts. However! When the weapon is shaped like this, it's an entirely different story. The wound would be too large for the blade to completely stop from bleeding!von Karma:von Karma:\nT-That's nothing more than conjecture! In reality, the victim was stabbed with the Shichishito. Even a weapon of this nature... ...may still sometimes slide out smoothly, and may still sometimes stop the blood loss!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nI'm not finished. There is still one more... conclusive contradiction.Judge:\nY-You've still got more!?Edgeworth:\n...This one is simple. If this sword really was thrust in all the way to the hilt... ...why is there only blood on the tip of it?von Karma:\nAh...!Edgeworth:\nIf this witness is telling the truth... Then there should be blood along the entire length of the sword!von Karma:\nNoooooo!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Ord-- Whaaaaaaaa!von Karma:\nBravo... Miles Edgeworth. Raising this many contradictions from a single piece of evidence! All the other attorneys I know could maybe manage one, if that!Judge:\nBut what does this all mean!? You have proven contradictions regarding the murder weapon, but...Edgeworth:\n...Having come this far, there can only be one answer.von Karma:\nAnd that is...?Edgeworth:\nThe weapon used to kill the victim... ...was not the Shichishito!Judge:\nW-Whaaaaaaaaat!?von Karma:\nA foolishly foolish idea born from the foolish mind of a foolhardy foolish fool.Edgeworth:\nLet's examine this again. What was it that made us think this sword was the murder weapon?Bikini:\nW-Well... It's because Mystic Ami was holding it...Edgeworth:\n...Exactly. However! If you reflect on this, that is the only basis we have to assume such a thing. The impression left by the scene was just too strong. That is what influenced us. It influenced us to believe that the Shichishito was the murder weapon!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! Waaaaaaaaah!von Karma:\nSo maybe the Shichishito was not the murder weapon. Even if that is the case... it changes nothing, Miles Edgeworth! The Sister here saw everything! She saw the defendant stab the victim with a sword-like object.Judge:\nHmmmmmm... That's true! Your response, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\n... If that is so... I would like the prosecution to answer the obvious question it raises.Judge:\nThe obvious... question?Edgeworth:\n...Yes. Namely... Where did the real murder weapon disappear to?von Karma:\n...!Edgeworth:\nIt goes without saying that the police searched the Main Hall and the surrounding area. ...Perhaps the prosecution can enlighten us as to if a \"sword-like object\" was found.von Karma:\nT-That's...Judge:\nAnswer the question, Ms. von Karma!von Karma:\n... No evidence of that kind was found.Judge:\nHmmmmm... Another mystery to throw onto the pile! A trial without a murder weapon is a tricky beast!Bikini:\nExcuse me... Could I say something...? I just remembered something, actually...von Karma:\n...What is it, Sister?Bikini:\nI was just thinking... It's possible... ...that just maybe... what actually happened was... it was just over there...Judge:\n... What exactly are you going on aboot here?Bikini:\nThe murder weapon, I mean! Maybe... I think I might know where the sword was disposed of!Edgeworth:\nYou what!?von Karma:\nWell then... I think we need to hear testimony from you one more time, Sister.Edgeworth:\n(Impossible...! What else... What else could this old woman have seen!?)Witness Testimony-- Location of the Weapon --Bikini:\nI saw the murder at around 11 PM...\nAnd after asking that it be reported, I went out to the Main Gate.\nAnd there... I saw tracks! Tracks that indicated the snowmobile had been used!\nIt takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, but less than 5 using one of those!\nMaybe they threw the weapon into Eagle River and came back while I was knocked out?\n...Iris could have done that. She can drive a snowmobile after all...Judge:\nHmmmmmm... Witness. Please, tell us everything you know right away next time.Bikini:\nWell. I'm not in the best of shape. What with my back and my age, you know.von Karma:\nQuite... There were indeed snowmobile tracks in front of the Main Gate. Here is a photograph.Judge:\nA snowmobile, eh... I see. Well, it certainly is an interesting theory...von Karma:\nThe tracks begin in front of Hazakura Temple... ...and run all the way to Dusky Bridge!Tracks Photo added to the Court Record.von Karma:\n...That solves your pesky little problem, yes? The Eagle River's current is quite swift, meaning that it doesn't freeze over in winter. Making it the perfect place to dispose of the murder weapon!Edgeworth:\n(Did she really go to the river to dispose of the murder weapon...?)Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth! ...Your cross-examination, please.Cross Examination",

The treasured Kurain Village heirloom whose name means \"7 Branched Sword\". It is said that this sacred sword represents life itself. Though the branches may appear to be infinite, the choices limitless... ...like our destinies, the sword comes to but one end. One merciless point. And when the silver cord, the fragile thread that binds us to this world, is severed... ...the illusion is revealed and the implacability of fate is finally laid bare...February 6, 9:48 AMWright & Co. Law OfficesMaya:\nHey, Nick.Phoenix:\nYeah? What is it?Maya:\nYou know how I've got spiritual powers, unlike you?Phoenix:\nUm, sure... You are a spirit medium, after all.Maya:\nBut just like you, if I don't keep my powers sharp, they get dull, right?Phoenix:\nUm... I guess so, yeah.Maya:\nGlad you agree! OK, Pearly! You're up!Phoenix:\n(Pearls...?)Pearl:\nSo! That's why we need to go on a special \"Spiritual Hot Spot Tour\", Mr. Nick!Phoenix:\n...Huh? I'm lost. What's this magazine you're shoving in my face?Pearl:\nIt's the New Year's issue of \"Oh! Cult!\", Winter Spiritual Locations Special!Phoenix:\n...Oh. (Pearls looks so happy.)Maya:\n\"Maximize your spiritual powers with just one night of intensive training!\" ...Oh! It sounds too good to be true!Phoenix:\nI'll say. It sounds more like a scam to me.Maya:\nIt's at a spiritual retreat called \"Hazakura Temple\". It's way up in the mountains, and I bet it's nice and cold. ...Just perfect for training!Phoenix:\n(Now I definitely don't want to go...)Maya:\nYou know, I think I've heard of this temple before. It's a famous channeling dojo. It's hard for even real spirit mediums like us to make reservations up there!Phoenix:\nReservations...? For a temple? Are you serious?Pearl:\nDon't worry! I've already made special reservations, just for us!Maya:\nYeah! And I signed up for the \"Special Course\"!Phoenix:\nTh-That's nice. And the timing couldn't be better. ...Since we don't have a case right now anyway.Maya:\nAlrighty then! It's settled! Well, come on! Don't just stand there! Start packing your stuff!Pearl:\nYes, Mr. Nick! You'd better start packing your stuff!Phoenix:\nHuh...? M-ME!? Why do I have to go!?Maya:\nWell, we have to be accompanied by someone over 20 years old.Phoenix:\nHey! I don't have anything to do with spirit power. The only thing I can channel is a TV. ... So, um, is there a heated pool at this \"Hazakura Temple\"?Pearl:\nNo, but you can stand under a freezing waterfall!Phoenix:\n... Sorry, but I think I'll pass. I hate cold places.Maya:\nWhaaat!? No way! How can you be so selfish!?Pearl:\nCome on, Mr. Nick! Look at this place! Doesn't it look beautiful!?Phoenix:\nNope. Not going. I'm gonna be nice and toasty at home....... .................What the...!?Pearl:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Nick?Phoenix:\nLet me see that magazine! Th-This nun...Maya:\nIs she a friend of yours or something, Nick?Phoenix:\n(Th-This girl... I-It's...!)Dahlia:\nMy name is Dahlia Hawthorne. I just want to say... It's an honor for me to be here in your noble presence.Dahlia:\nHonestly, how can any woman ever count on you for anything? ...You disgust me!Phoenix:\nBut... It can't be! (She was found guilty and should still be in prison...)Pearl:\n...Mr. Nick?Phoenix:\n... I'll go.Maya:\nHuh...?Phoenix:\nHazakura Temple... I said I'll go.Maya:\nYay! Isn't that great, Pearly!?Pearl:\nYes! Oh, thank you! Thank you, Mr. Nick! You'd do anything for Mystic Maya, right? Even walk over burning coals, right!?\"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue received from Pearls.Phoenix:\n(Dahlia Hawthorne... I knew there was no way she could possibly be at that temple... But, I just had to be see for myself... ...who this \"nun\" really was.)February 7, 3:24 PMHazakura TempleMain GateMaya:\nBrrrrr... It-It-It's so c-c-cold here, Nick!Phoenix:\nMaybe you should put on something warmer for a change!Maya:\nW-W-Well, it's supposed to be c-c-cold... It's t-t-training. ...Ah-Achoo!Phoenix:\n(Her teeth are chattering so loudly, it's all I can do to make out what she's saying...)Pearl:\nWow, Mystic Maya! So this is the famous Hazakura Temple!Maya:\nP-P-P-Pearly... I-I-I-I... Ah-Achoo!???:\nWell, well, well... How nice to see you here. Welcome to our temple!Maya:\nOh...! Th-Th-Thank you... Ah-Achoo!???:\nOh my, my, my... Thank you for coming all this way. Come now, come now. You must have been cold.Phoenix:\nWhat's with the past tense...? We're freezing into human popsicles as we spea--!???:\nHo ho ho. Well, we are high up in the mountains after all. In any case, we shouldn't speak here. ...Please follow me inside.Maya:\nTh-Thank you. I was starting to think I would pass--???:\nOh! Yes, yes! I almost forgot to introduce myself.Bikini:\nI'm the head nun here at the temple. My name is Bikini.Maya:\nB-B-B-Bikini...!?Bikini:\nThat's riiight! Actually, that's my \"temple\" name. What do you think? It's a tradition to have one, and I wanted something that has a nice image to it. So I thought, \"Why not choose a bikini?\" Besides, it makes me seem younger. Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho!Maya:\nIt certainly does! Oh, I signed up for your \"Special Course\"!Bikini:\nWell, my, my, my. Quite brave of you considering how cold it is! Young people can be so reckless with their health! Don't blame me if you become one with those you channel. Wa ha ha! Ho ho ho!Pearl:\nR-Reckless...?Maya:\n\"Wa ha ha\"...?Pearl:\nMaybe you should take it easy tonight, Mystic Maya... We can come back another day.Maya:\nBut you went through all that trouble to get reservations for m--Bikini:\nYes, yes, yes, that's right! You've come all this way, so please, enjoy yourselves! There's still time before supper, so why don't you have a look around?Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nWhat do you think, Nick? Pretty awesome gate, huh?\nPhoenix:\nIt sure is... It looks pretty well maintained, too. This thing kinda puts your hometown to shame, Maya.\nMaya:\nYeah... Well, a lot of things have happened in Kurain Village. We used to be a lot richer, back when people hired us to perform channelings.\nPhoenix:\nOh, I see... But now the place looks a bit run down...\nMaya:\nHmm... I guess I was just born in the wrong time.\n\n\n\n\nMain Hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nThat looks like the Main Hall where we'll be staying tonight. From here, it looks like one of those ice hotels you always hear about!\nPhoenix:\n...They gotta have a heater or something in there, don't you think? I don't wanna die.\nMaya:\nI'm not worried, I brought my hot-water bottle.\nPhoenix:\nDid you bring one for me?\nMaya:\nWhat are you talking about, Nick? Who carries around 2 hot-water bottles?\nPhoenix:\n(Brr! If the cold doesn't kill me, the ice queen over here will finish the job...)\n\n\n\n\nBell tower\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nOh, look! It's a cute little bell tower! I absolutely love the sound of a giant bell!\nPhoenix:\nOh? So, which do you like better? That or the sound of money?\nMaya:\n...! ...... Sorry, but I'll take money for the win, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What are you apologizing for?\n\n\n\n\nSnowmobile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nOh look, it's one of those snow motorcycle things!\nPhoenix:\nMost people call that a \"snowmobile\", you know.\nMaya:\n\"Snow motorcycle things\", \"Snowblowmeal\". Same thing. Hmm... Too bad we didn't invite Desirée. I bet she could race like the wind on this \"Slowmobile\"! Or maybe she'd give me ride on this \"Blowsnowbile\".\nPhoenix:\nArgh! I told you, it's \"snowmobile\"!Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanneling dojo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUmm... So what's a \"channeling dojo\" anyway?\nBikini:\nOh my, my, my... You don't even know that?\nMaya:\nForgive him, Sister, for he knows not what he is saying.\nBikini:\nWell, well, well. Just call me Bikini and forget that \"Sister\" part. A channeling dojo is basically a spiritual power training ground. We have special holy items prepared here to help people boost their spiritual power.\nPhoenix:\nH-Holy items...?\nBikini:\nIf you train an entire evening surrounded by these items... Aaah. It's quite mysterious. The spiritual power of these items seems to envelop you. Wa ha ha ha.\nPhoenix:\n(Wow, she must have just gotten off the trolley from the land of make-believe...)\nMaya:\nUm, so what exactly is the \"Special Course\"...?\nBikini:\nYou must be incredibly devoted to be interested in that at such a young age! It's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant a spell... ...30,000 times! All while being showered in freezing cold spirit water.\nMaya:\nEh...?\nBikini:\nIt's February now, right? You have to be careful this time of the year... If you don't watch it, you'll catch pneumonia or maybe even die of hypothermia... So be careful, you hear? Wa ha ha. Ho ho ho. Ha!\nMaya:\nHow am I supposed to \"be careful\"...?\nPearl:\nOh no... I knew I shouldn't have signed Mystic Maya up for this...\n\n\n\n\nThe other nun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUmm, Sister... About this picture...\nBikini:\nWell, well. Look at that. I must say I look rather divine here, don't you think?\nPhoenix:\nOh, um, yeah. Unforgettable in every way.\nBikini:\nYou mean it? Oh, I knew it! Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho ho! The makeup was pretty tough, but Iris helped me out.\nMaya:\n\"Iris\"...?\nBikini:\nThe cute little girl in the photo. She looks just like me, doesn't she? We're just a small temple here, so she and I run the entire place.\nMaya:\nReally? That kinda sounds like fu--\nPhoenix:\nSorry to cut in, but...! This \"Iris\"... Where is she right now?\nBikini:\nOh! Just listen to you! You haven't come all the way up here just to find a girlfriend, have you?\nPearl:\n... *glare*\nPhoenix:\nNo, no, no! Th-That's not what I had in mind at all...\nBikini:\nAnyway, Iris is in the Inner Temple preparing for this evening.\nMaya:\nInner Temple...?\nBikini:\nYes, yes, that's right. Iris will be back this evening. Why don't you go have a look at the Main Hall for now? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha.\nPhoenix:\n(So she's in the Inner Temple, huh...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm, do you think you could take a look at this?\nBikini:\nI may not look like it, but I can tell you I'm very much in demand. And to be quite honest, I'm finding this a little difficult to say...\nPearl:\n...What IS she trying to say, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI think she's trying to say that she's busy.\nMaya:\nBut seriously Nick, what's the deal? Nothing has even happened yet and you're already shoving evidence into people's faces. You need to forget about work and relax a little.\nPearl:\nTry to have some fun, OK Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, you're right... (Sure. Pin the hypothermia on the lawyer is great fun!)February 7Hazakura TempleMain HallMaya:\nBrr... It's fr-freezing in here, too! Achoo!Pearl:\nHee hee. It reminds me of the Meditation Room in Fey Manor!Phoenix:\n...Pearls, you've been in an unusually good mood since we got here.Pearl:\nWell, kids are made of energy, you know!Phoenix:\nAs for you, Maya, you look like you're about to catch a bad cold.Maya:\nW-W-Well, I'm not exactly a little kid anymore, I guess. Ah-Achoo!Phoenix:\n(Nngh... Is she going to make it...?)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSliding doors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI bet the writing on these sliding doors are instructions for spirit channeling... Kinda like how we scribbled math formulas on the bathroom walls to remember them. Except we couldn't go to the bathroom during tests... And I can't read these walls.\n\n\n\n\nObjects on floor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere are straw zabuton cushions arranged around a hibachi brazier... I haven't seen a layout like this since I saw this really old Japanese movie on TV. ...If it wasn't for this hibachi, they'd probably freeze to death.\n\n\n\n\nAltar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's an altar. It looks a bit old, but someone does a good job taking care of it. Speaking of altars, I remember seeing one like this in Kurain Village last year. I guess they really do have something to do with spiritual power after all.\n\n\n\n\nMagatama on altar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere's a laughably large Magatama on the altar. If I can see Psyche-Locks with the tiny Magatama I've got... ...I can only imagine what kind of power this bad boy has under his hood!\n\n\n\n\nLeft corner near altar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's a stack of straw zabuton cushions. Maya told me this type of zabuton is called \"enza\"... I suppose if I'd never come here, I'd have missed out on all these new things.February 7Suspension BridgeMaya:\nWow! Look at this broken down old bridge, Nick!Phoenix:\nY-Yeah, and look at that big canyon below us.Maya:\nHey! There's a river down there! It looks like it's flowing real fast! ...What's wrong, Nick? You look like you've seen a ghost!Phoenix:\nI-I'm just not very good with heights...Maya:\nOh... Hey! I've got it! Maybe you should face your fear and try hurling yourself off the edge? You know! One... Two... Three... Jump! It might be just what you need to get over your fear of heights!Phoenix:\n...Yeah, death is a real good way to overcome phobias alright. Anyway, it sure looks like a rickety bridge.Maya:\nCan't argue there. That's probably why it's called, \"Dusty Bridge\".Phoenix:\nRead it again, Maya. It says, \"Dusky Bridge\".Maya:\nWell, it's practically the same thing.Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCliff on opposite side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like it's about 20 yards to that cliff over there.\nMaya:\nI guess that's where I'll be training tonight. Do you want to train with me, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nAnd do the Special Course? I think not.\nMaya:\nBut it'd be so great if you had spiritual powers, too! (Really? \"I see dead people\" sounds more like a cause for alarm to me...)\n\n\n\n\nWooden sign on left side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere's a narrow path going off in a different direction than that of the Main Hall.\nMaya:\nThe sign here is so old, the text seems to have vanished.\nPhoenix:\nThe path leads to a wooden staircase that goes down to the bottom of the canyon.\nMaya:\nOK, I'll write, \"wooden staircase\" on it then.\nPhoenix:\n...Do you really think that is necessary? You'd have to be blind not to see the stairs.\nMaya:\nWell, it can't hurt. Just pass me a pencil, OK?\nPhoenix:\nGraffiti is a crime, Maya.\n\n\n\n\nBridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! Why don't we hop across the bridge. It'll be fun!\nPhoenix:\nI'm not so sure... It looks like a bunny hopping across the bridge would destroy it.\nMaya:\nOK, Nick. Then let's try to find a cute little white bunny and test your theory.\nPhoenix:\n(That right there sums up the fundamental difference between sane and insane.)\n\n\n\n\nBoulder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSome letters are engraved into a roughly cut boulder.\nMaya:\n\"D-U-S-T-Y Bridge\", huh?\nPhoenix:\nIt says, \"Dusky\"! \"Dusky Bridge\"! OK?\nMaya:\nC'mon, Nick! Take a look at that bridge and tell me it's not supposed to be \"Dusty\"! This sign is obviously wrong, and I'm gonna fix it! Now give me a pencil, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nDo I look like a pencil holder to you?\n\n\n\n\nPublic phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nI can't believe there's a public phone here. Who would ever use it?\nPhoenix:\nThe people who live here, I guess. I doubt they have any real phones there.\nMaya:\nYeah, but it took like 20 minutes to walk here from the Main Hall! ... It would've been smarter of them to build the Main Hall here, don't you think?\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe you should work on channeling someone who makes logical sense, Maya.After clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate:February 7Hazakura TempleMain HallMaya:\nTh-Th-The Main Hall... I th-think it's even c-c-c-colder in here! Achoo!Pearl:\nAh! Mr. Nick! Do you smell that? It smells like meat and gravy!Maya:\nYeah, you're right! I guess it's pot roast for tonight! Yum!Phoenix:\n...Weird. I thought they would serve something a little more... well, traditional.Maya:\nWhat are you talking about, Nick!? You think monks and nuns just sit around eating rice gruel all the time!?Pearl:\nMystic Maya is right! Ooh! I hope there's mashed potatoes, too! I love mashed potatoes!???:\nHa ha ha... What a cute little acolyte! Greetings to all of you.Phoenix:\nOh... Um, hello. (Wow, this lady makes Maya look like a 6.8/10 on the weirdness scale.)Maya:\nYour outfit... Did you come here for the Special Course, too...????:\nHa, ha, ha... Unfortunately, no. Actually, I'm...Pearl:\nAaaaaaaaaah! Y-You're...! Y-You're...! You're Ms. Elise Deauxnim!Elise:\nYes, that's right... You know of me?Pearl:\nM-M-My name... My name is Pearl Fey! I-I'm your biggest fan!Maya:\nWho is she, Nick?Phoenix:\nHmm... I see it now... Zvarri! A fortune-teller...?Pearl:\nI-I've got all your books, Ms. Deauxnim!Elise:\nHa, ha, ha... What a sweet thing to say. And please, call me Elise.Phoenix:\nUm, \"books\"...?Pearl:\nMr. Nick, don't you know anything!? Don't you even know who this is?Phoenix:\nWell, um... ...An author, maybe?Elise:\nYes, and an illustrator. ...Of picture books.Maya:\nPicture books, huh? Oh, now I get it...Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElise Deauxnim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... I'm sorry I didn't know who you are. I don't get a lot of chances to really enjoy picture books.\nElise:\nIt's alright. I take no offense to that. My books are nothing but simple stories for children.\nPearl:\nAnd really beautiful pictures too, Ms. Elise! Your books always make me feel as if my heart has been purified.\nElise:\nHa ha ha... It makes me feel very happy to hear you say that.\nPhoenix:\n(I do have to admit... She certainly seems like a kind, sensitive lady.)\nPearl:\nMs. Elise won an award last year for her book, \"The Magic Bottle\"!\nElise:\nYes... A friend of mine secretly submitted a story I had written to a publisher. They liked it so much that they asked if it was alright to make it into a book.\nPhoenix:\nWow... It must have been a really great story.\nMaya:\n...Maybe I should try to write a children's book, too. If I do, you can secretly send it to a publisher for me, Nick.\nElise:\nRecently, I've accepted a sort of... apprentice you might say.\nPhoenix:\nAn apprentice?\nElise:\nHe calls himself Laurice... Laurice Deauxnim. I believe he's off doing some landscape sketches now... On Laurice's behalf as well, I'd like to thank you for your support.\nPearl:\nOf course, Ms. Elise! Anything for you!\nElise:\nHa ha ha...\n\n\n\n\nWhy come here?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPearl:\nUm... Why did you come to Hazakura Temple, Ms. Elise? Are you here... to do some spiritual training?\nElise:\nHa ha ha... No, that's not it. I'm actually here to gather materials for a new book I'm working on.\nPearl:\nWow! I-I can't wait to read it!\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls is completely taken with her...)\nElise:\nI wanted to do a book with a more Japanese feel to it this time.\nPhoenix:\n...So is that why you're dressed like you are?\nElise:\nThe children have a certain image of me in their minds. I don't want to disappoint them...\nPhoenix:\n(What can I say... She's really a sweet lady...)\nPearl:\nWow, Ms. Elise, you're dressed up like a mountain nun!\nElise:\nYes. The good people here were kind enough to let me borrow this... I'm wearing training clothes underneath my robe, as well.\nMaya:\n...I want a staff like that.\nElise:\nYou like the crystal sphere? It's real amethyst, you know.\nMaya:\nMaybe we'll find one like that up here on this mountain. Good luck, Nick! I know you'll find me one!Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMs. Deauxnim? What do you think about this?\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Do you think Ms. Elise is a suspect?\nPhoenix:\nHuh...?\nPearl:\nYou may be Mystic Maya's special someone, but I won't let you do this to Ms. Elise!\nPhoenix:\n(A suspect? Why would I suspect her of anything? It's not like anything's happened.)\nMaya:\nIsn't it cute, Nick? Pearly's getting all overprotective of her new friend.After clearing all Talk options:Elise:\nWell, you'll have to excuse me now... I have to go help with the dinner preparations.Pearl:\nWow! You mean you're cooking dinner tonight?Elise:\nThat's right. Would you like to help too, Pearl?Pearl:\nYes, yes! I want to help with whatever I can!Phoenix:\n(Pearls looks like she just won the lottery...)Maya:\nOh, I'll help too, then...Elise:\n...No, it's fine. Please don't worry about it. Feel free to relax and explore the area with your friend.Maya:\nHuh!? But...Elise:\n...Oh, yes! Please take this. I think it will be of help to you. It's a map of the area. We wouldn't want you to get lost now, would we?Phoenix:\n(The \"Inner Temple\"... There it is, on the other side of the bridge...) Well, if you insist, I guess we'll take this chance to go check out the other temple.Hazakura Temple Map added to the Court Record.Pearl:\nOK! I'll see you two later then! Remember! You're not allowed to fight!Maya:\nCome on, Nick! Let's go! At least we'll stay warm if we keep moving!February 7Hazakura TempleMain GateMaya:\nHuh? Where did Sister Bikini go?Phoenix:\nI guess she went to the Inner Temple... To go help that other nun out.Maya:\nOh, right... I think her name is... Iris?Phoenix:\nY-Yeah... That was it. (I want to find out who Iris really is, but I'm scared of what I'll find...)Maya:\n...?February 7Inner Temple GateMaya:\nWhoa, that bridge was shaking like jello in an earthquake.Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nAnd at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I bet. (Changed from [And at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I'd bet.] in the original release)Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nNot to mention the last part only had like one board left on it!Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nWhat's wrong with you? Your face is all green.Phoenix:\nC-Can you not pick on me for a second? I'm still trying to get over the shock that we made it safely across that death trap.Maya:\nYeah, I guess I'm a bit surprised, too... Yikes! That \"temple\" is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse at any time... (Changed from [Yikes! That 'temple' is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse anytime...] in the original release)Phoenix:\nI guess people don't use it too often. Is this really where you're going to train tonight?Maya:\nThat has to be it. It's kinda creepy around here... Like a ghost might jump out at you or something!Phoenix:\n(A spirit medium afraid of ghosts...? Isn't it ironic, don't you think?)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI don't care how much you pay me, I don't want to cross that bridge again.\nMaya:\nNo worries, Nick. No one is offering you any money.\nPhoenix:\nThat's because no reasonable person would call that pile of popsicle sticks a bridge! The latter half of it was nothing more than a few planks of wood and some string!\nMaya:\nHey, if we want to get back, we've got no choice but to cross it again, you know.\nPhoenix:\n... Maybe I'll just stay... I've always dreamed of living in a little shack in the woods.\nMaya:\n...Wow, you really are scared, aren't you?\n\n\n\n\nSuspension wire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nIt looks like this bridge is suspended by 4 of these wires.\nPhoenix:\n...They're reeeally thin. Shouldn't they be just a little thicker...?\nMaya:\nOh, stop it! You're such a worrywart, Nick! If the bridge were really going to collapse... ...I'm pretty sure the boards would break before these wires ever did!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nWhat's wrong? You're turning into an over-ripe avocado again.\n\n\n\n\nBuddha statues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nOh, wow! Look at these neat Buddha statues. Maybe I'll take one home with me.\nPhoenix:\nMaya!\nMaya:\nBut there are so many. They wouldn't notice if I took just one.\nPhoenix:\nAre you kidding? Of course they'll notice! What are you gonna do with one of those anyway?\nMaya:\nPut it in the office of course! We can trade that wooden statue in the office reception area for one of these!\nPhoenix:\n(You know, come to think of it, where did that wooden statue come from anyway...?)\n\n\n\n\nIncinerator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nHey! There's a giant robot buried in the snow!\nPhoenix:\n... Well, there's something buried in the snow, but... I think it's an incinerator.\nMaya:\nOh... Hee hee. But you've gotta admit it looks a lot like a robot.\nPhoenix:\nUm, sure... Anyway, I don't think it gets used much. It's looking pretty rusty.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Do you think this Giant Robo-cinerator can walk?\nPhoenix:\nI told you! It's not a robot! ...And it's not especially big either.\nMaya:\nBah, you have no imagination. I thought it'd be real neat if you had to beat it to advance.\nPhoenix:\n(A fight between a lawyer and an overgrown furnace? Who'd ever pay to see that!?)\n\n\n\n\nYellow gate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nHey! A half-opened gate! That's practically a welcome mat!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, except the sign on here says, \"No Entry\".\nMaya:\nUmm, Nick. Rules are made to be broken, you know.\nPhoenix:\n...You expect a lawyer to go along with that?\nMaya:\nOh, come on! You're such an old lady sometimes! Let's just go!\nPhoenix:\nDon't blame it on me when Sister Bikini puts a curse on you.\nMaya:\n... Now you've got me scared. Um, let's just forget about it, OK?\n\n\n\n\nWooden log on left\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nLooks like there's something written on it.\nPhoenix:\nI can't read it, but if I had to take a good guess, I'd say it says, \"Inner Temple\".\nMaya:\nWhat's the point of a sign if you can't read it? Must be tough for the mailman when he's delivering here.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess the sign is a good indication of how long this place has been here...)\n\n\n\n\nGate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nSo that's the Inner Temple up ahead, huh?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks kinda run-down.\nMaya:\nWell, it wouldn't be very temple-like if it was all bright and shiny.\nPhoenix:\nSo you're training here tonight, huh?\nMaya:\nYup! Then everyone'll see my spiritual powers!\n...Uuurrrgh...ggnngh...ggh...\nPhoenix:\nSounds like your stomach wants to show off its digestive powers instead...\nMaya:\nI wonder if that roast is ready yet?February 7Inner TempleTraining HallPhoenix:\nMan, look at this place... It's just a tiny, freezing-cold room. So this is where you'll both be training, huh...Maya:\nHuh? What do you mean, \"both\"? I'm the only one.Phoenix:\nReally? But I thought...Maya:\nPearly's just a little kid. She couldn't handle this kind of intense training.Phoenix:\n(So says the girl who I can barely hear over her teeth chattering...) (Changed from [So says the girl who I can barely hear over her bones chattering...] in the original release)Maya:\nAnyway... The real training room must be behind that door over there. Hmm... Yup, definitely getting the feeling it's back there. (Changed from [Yeah, I get the feeling it's back there, definitely.] in the original release)Phoenix:\n(Even I can sense that there's something supernatural about the cavern behind that door...) (Changed from [If only because the cavern behind that door is giving off a real supernatural feel...] in the original release)???:\nUm... Excuse me, but... Who are you...? ...Ah! ...Phoenix:\nY-You're...Maya:\nHi there! We're just looking around since we're going to be staying here tonight...???:\n...Maya:\n...? Is something wrong????:\nUh, er, no! It-It's nothing...Maya:\nI wonder why she spaced out like that. Don't you, Nick?Phoenix:\nUh... D-Did you say something, M-Maya?Maya:\n... Not you too, Nick...Iris:\nI... M-My name is Iris. I'm one of the nuns here at this temple.Maya:\nI'm Maya Fey. It's a pleasure to meet you!Iris:\nThe pleasure is mine... ... Oh, er, please excuse me! I have some... um, chores to attend to.Maya:\nShe sure is beautiful... and a bit spacey, I guess... I guess she's just not used to talking with urban sophisticates like us.Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nNick?Phoenix:\n(That girl... It-It can't be, but...)Maya:\n...?Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDresser drawers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nLook at this antique dresser. I wonder if there's anything valuable inside. Let's have a look... Hmph... Nothing! Just a bunch of clothes. Hey, Nick.\nPhoenix:\n... Huh! Oh, sorry. I was just... thinking.\nMaya:\nOh? About Iris, I bet! Looks like you've been bitten by the love bug, Nick!\n\n\n\n\nMattresses\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere are a bunch of musty looking blankets and bedding sets piled up here. I wonder why they're even here in the first place? \nMaya:\nIt's because all spiritual training is done under the supervision of a nun. I wonder if Sister Bikini is planning to sleep in here while I train? \nPhoenix:\n(But if they sleep, what's the point of having them here in the first place...?)\n\n\n\n\nSacred cavern entrance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nThe actual training area must be on the other side of this door. I wonder what it's like. Phooey... It's locked. Come on, Nick! You know you want to open it for me!\nPhoenix:\n...I can't.\nMaya:\n... You've been in kind of a bad mood lately, haven't you, Nick? ...Zvarri! I know what it is! I-R-I-S.\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nHa ha ha ha ha! ♪Iris and Nick, sitting in a tree! K-I-S-S-I-N-G!♪\n\n\n\n\nHanging scroll\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(A hanging scroll... It doesn't look that old either...)\nMaya:\nAAAAAAH!\nPhoenix:\nAAAAAAAAACK! Wh-What is it!? Why did you scream like that!?\nMaya:\nTh-This scroll...! It-It's my mother...\nPhoenix:\nWh... Whaaaaaaaat!?\nMaya:\n...It's Misty Fey. The Master of the Kurain School of Channeling...\nPhoenix:\nAre... Are you sure?\nMaya:\nYes... The crest at the top of the scroll... That's the special mark of the Master of our tradition.\nPhoenix:\n(So that's what the mark means...)\nMaya:\n...\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it?\nMaya:\nN-Nothing... It's just that... I last saw her over 15 years ago... If it wasn't for that crest... I wouldn't have even known it was her. My own mother... And I can't even recognize her face.\nPhoenix:\nMaya...\nHanging Scroll added to the Court Record.\n\n\n\n\nHanging scroll (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's a hanging wall scroll showing Maya's mother, Misty Fey. It's not that old. That crest at the top is the official mark of the Master. I wonder if this temple has some sort of connection to \nthe Fey family...\nMaya:\nI think it does, actually. Supposedly, it was founded by a branch family member of the Kurain School.\nPhoenix:\n(I'll have to ask Bikini in more detail when I get the chance... About Maya... And the Fey family in general.)After examining hanging scroll in Inner Temple - Training Hall:February 7Dusky BridgeMaya:\nWhew, we managed to make it across Dusty Bridge.Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nNick, you look green. Are you feeling alright?Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nHey! What's wrong with you? Ever since we met Sister Iris at the Training Hall, you've been really quiet.Phoenix:\nHuh!? Oh, um. Sorry...???:\nHey, you! ...Wait up!Maya:\n...? You think he's yelling at us?Phoenix:\nHe must be. There's no one else around...???:\nWould you mind moving? You're standing right in my way. ... Ah!Maya:\nHey! I know you! You're...???:\nWhoa! Sorry! Gotta run! ...See ya!Phoenix:\nH-Hey! Wait a minute!???:\nOh, uh, nice to meet you. ...I'm Laurice Deauxnim.Phoenix:\nLiar! You're Larry! Your clothes may change, but you're still the Butz.Butz:\nShaddup! I'm... I'm... Lauriiiiice! And I'm just here to do a sketch of Dusky Bridge!Maya:\nSo... it really is our Larry. ...Not that I get why he's pretending to be someone else.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaurice Deauxnim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo what are you doing with the last name, \"Deauxnim\"?\nButz:\nWell I... I just... I wanted to start over again! With a clean slate!\nMaya:\nA clean slate...?\nButz:\nYou remember don't you? Last time?\nPhoenix:\n(The Mask☆DeMasque case...)\nButz:\nAfter that, I started to realize I didn't like this guy known as Larry Butz! And that's when I came across it... The book of destiny!\nMaya:\nThe \"book of destiny\"...? Do you mean...?\nButz:\n\"The Magic Bottle\"! By Ms. Elise Deauxnim! It's so beautiful... So moving... So... So gentle. My heart felt cleansed! I-I was saved!\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe I should buy a copy of \"The Magic Bottle\"...)\nMaya:\nWow, Larry would make a great book salesman! I really want to get that book now, too!\n\n\n\n\nElise Deauxnim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nShe's the most wonderful person I've ever met! I'd follow her anywhere!\nMaya:\nWell, she certainly is a very elegant lady.\nButz:\nYou see? You see? Here's a photo I took of her in secret!\nMaya:\nWow! That's a beautiful photo!\nButz:\nYou want a copy, don't you? It's OK... I just happened to have made extra prints!\nPhoto of Elise added to the Court Record.\n\n\n\n\nElise Deauxnim (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nShe's the most wonderful person I've ever met!

That's a beautiful photo!\n\n\n\n\nPicture books\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nStill, it's kinda hard to imagine you as a picture book illustrator... So tell the truth. You must have some kind of ulterior motive, right?\nButz:\nWh-What're you talking about!? I don't... I don't trust anyone anymore... Especially not women!\nMaya:\n...Talk about a bad case of denial.\nPhoenix:\nAnyway... Can you even draw well enough to make a picture book?\nButz:\nArt isn't only about technical skill, you know. It's also about having a pure heart!\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's why I'm asking. Can you draw well enough to make a whole book?\nButz:\n...! Hmm... Now that you mention it... I wonder.\nMaya:\nIt looks like you still have some doubt in your heart.\nButz:\nIt's true, I do... But when I first saw her, I felt it! Something inside me ended, and something else began.\nMaya:\nOh Larry, it sounds like you've fallen in love with Ms. Elise Deauxnim!\nButz:\nNo! Y-You're wrong! It's not her... It's the other girl!\nPhoenix:\n\"Other girl\"...? Uh oh... (I got a bad feeling about this...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nWow! You're even cuter than the last time I saw you.\nMaya:\nOh, really!?\nButz:\nYeah, you look like a totally different person! Don't you think so, Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe it's 'cause we're always together, but she looks pretty much the same to me.)\n\n\n\n\nMia Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nHey, I remember her! That's Maya's big sister!\nMaya:\nWow! You really do remember!\nButz:\nYeah, who could forget! A couple of gorgeous sisters! Hubba hubba!\nMaya:\nYou hear that, Nick! Gorgeous!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh yeah... That's right. When I defended Larry... Mia was still alive...)\n\n\n\n\nPearl Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nI haven't seen her in a while, so I bet she's gotten a lot bigger.\nPhoenix:\nWell, it's only been 5 months since we celebrated Ron's non-guilty verdict.\nButz:\nMaybe so, but kids these days grow up so fast.\nPhoenix:\n...She hasn't changed a bit as far as I can tell.\nButz:\nCome on, Nick... I really doubt that. You just don't know 'cause you don't pay enough attention, that's all.\nPhoenix:\n(Sometimes I really worry about what goes on inside this guy's head...)\n\n\n\n\nBikini profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nShe seems really motherly, doesn't she?\nButz:\nWhat do you mean \"seems\" motherly?

She's like a mother to me.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, you can tell from the kindness reflected in her eyes.\nButz:\nWhen I first looked into her eyes, I just couldn't help it. I started blabbing about all the bad things I had done in my life. She just laughed that gentle laugh of hers and listened!\nPhoenix:\n(Are you sure she wasn't just laughing at you...?)\n\n\n\n\nIris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nWhoo yeah! Her! My little Iris!\nMaya:\nShe's really pretty.\nButz:\nThis girl... She's perfect! She's exactly my type! I wonder if she would model for me. I want to draw a portrait of her.\nMaya:\nYeah, you always liked those model types, didn't you Larry? ...Hey, wait a sec! Didn't you say you were swearing off women...?\nButz:\nHuh!? Yeah, that's right. Of course I have! I have... basically. But...\nMaya:\n\"But\"...?\nButz:\nBut... Iris is different. I feel like... I feel like I still have one chance left at the dream...\nPhoenix:\n(This guy will never change.)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nHey, I know I may not look like it, but I'm an artist.

Pearly!Pearl:\nDinner preparations are complete! Please come quickly to the Main Hall!Maya:\nAlright! I can't wait to dig in, Pearly!Pearl:\nI'm going to go to the Inner Temple and call Sister Iris! I also want to have a look at where Mystic Maya is going to be training...February 7, 7:46 PMHazakura TempleMain HallMaya:\nBoy am I stuffed...Phoenix:\nAre you sure it's alright to eat that much before your training?Maya:\nWell, this kind of training is a battle of endurance.Pearl:\nMystic Maya... Please don't do anything that might put your health at risk.Maya:\nHa ha ha. No pain, no gain, I guess.Pearl:\nNngh... I'm still worried about you...Bikini:\nWell, well, well. Let's not dilly-dally shilly-shally. You must get ready for tonight.Elise:\nGood luck. ...Maya.Maya:\nAlright! Here I go! I'll see you all tomorrow, I guess!Bikini:\nIris, please ring the bell at 10:00 for lights out, alright?Iris:\nYes, Sister Bikini.Bikini:\nAnd then, after you ring the bell, I want you to come join us at the Training Hall.Iris:\nI understand, Sister Bikini.Phoenix:\n(Maya and Bikini really seem excited about this training thing tonight...)Elise:\n...Well, Pearl? What are you going to do tonight?Pearl:\nWell, umm...Elise:\nIf you'd like, you can come to my room. Perhaps we can read some books together.Pearl:\nR-Really!? I'd love to! I, umm... I'm not very good at reading.Elise:\nHa ha ha. Well then, would you like to practice reading with me?Pearl:\nAh! I'd love to!Phoenix:\n(Pearls is absolutely smitten with Ms. Deauxnim...) So Larry, what are you going to do?Butz:\nHuh... Me? Um, well... I'm just gonna hang out in my room. I can't stand the cold at all.Phoenix:\n(I totally hear you there.)Pearl:\nUm, Ms. Elise? So, for example, how do you read this?Elise:\nIt says, \"gravely\"... That's kind of a tough word.Pearl:\nOh! OK! And what about this word?Elise:\nThat's another tough one. It says, \"roast\".Phoenix:\n(What kind of a book is she reading anyway...?)Pearl:\nWell, I'm going to go wash the dishes and help clean up. I'll go visit you when I'm done, Ms. Elise!Phoenix:\n(Well, not much to do except head to my room and huddle under the covers, I guess...)February 7, 9:12 PMHazakura TempleMain HallPhoenix:\n(Ugh... It's a whole different type of cold up here in the mountains! Argh... Why couldn't the nearest bathroom be just a little closer to my room...?)???:\n...Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nYaaaaaaah! Oh! Ah, Ms. Deauxnim! Are you going to use the bathroom, too?Elise:\nUm, no. But... Have you seen Pearl?Phoenix:\nNo... Not since after dinner. I thought she said she was going to go to your room...Elise:\nI know... But she never showed up. I-I'm going to go look for her. ...Excuse me.Phoenix:\n(Ms. Elise Deauxnim... A woman as mysterious in origin as her last name... But... The really mysterious one is...)Iris:\nOh...Phoenix:\nAh...! S-Sister Iris...!Iris:\nG... G-Good evening...Phoenix:\n(The real mysterious one is this girl...!)Iris:\nUm, are you on your way to the bathroom too, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n(...I can't let this chance pass me by! I should try to talk with her... And maybe get some answers.)Move\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n...It's freezing cold out there. And dark, too.

You're Sister Iris, right?\nIris:\n...Yes.\nPhoenix:\nS-So... um, when did you come to Hazakura Temple?\nIris:\n... I don't remember. Ever since I was a small child, the temple has been my home.\nPhoenix:\nSo you've never left?\nIris:\nWell, I don't have any family left to take care of me... Sister Bikini... I've come to think of her as my real mother, as it were.\nPhoenix:\nAh, I see... But you... Didn't you go to college? ...And maybe enroll with the Ivy University Literature Department?\nIris:\nNo, I never had an interest in going to a big university like that... My training is all the education I need.\nPhoenix:\nI... I see...\nIris:\nBut... Once in a while, when I get the chance, I make a trip to the nearby town. I can use a computer and a cell phone, too.\nPhoenix:\n... (That's not exactly something worth bragging about... But I don't see any Psyche-Locks... ...so I guess that means she's not lying...)\nIris:\nP-Please don't stare at me like that...\n\n\n\n\nHazakura Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of a place is this anyway? I heard it's for training to increase your spiritual power or something like that.\nIris:\nIt must seem awfully crazy to normal people like you.\nPhoenix:\nWell, I have to admit it is a whole different world up here...\nIris:\nI'm glad to hear you say that.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nIris:\nTalking with dead people... Who does it help anyway? ...I hate it.\nPhoenix:\nR-Really?

I have to go and ring the bell for lights out...Phoenix:\n(I guess it's almost 10:00 now, huh?)Iris:\n... Um... Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n...Yes?Iris:\nIf it's alright with you... I would like you to have this.Phoenix:\nBut this is your hood...Iris:\nIt has the power to protect you from evil spirits.Phoenix:\n(Come to think of it, Sister Bikini was wearing one of these, too...)Iris:\nI pray for your safety on this dark, cold night.Iris's Hood received from Iris.Iris:\nI'm sorry, but I must bid you goodnight.Phoenix:\nWait a minute, Sister Iris...Iris:\nY-Yes...?Phoenix:\nJust now, you called me by my name... You said, \"Mr. Wright\". How did you know my name? I never introduced myself to you.Iris:\nTh-That's...Phoenix:\n...Sister Iris. Please, tell me the truth. You and I...

Maya... and Iris's Bikini... ...Huh? Say something, Edgey!Edgeworth:\n...Before I came here, I stopped in at the hospital where Wright is. I believe I have a better understanding of the situation than you, at this point. The murder victim was the picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. She was found by Wright and the head nun. The suspect is the temple's younger nun. Then later, while Wright was crossing the bridge, it broke and he fell into the river. The hospital says that he'll need at least 2 days of bed rest.Butz:\nY-Yes! Th-That's right! You got it! B-But they arrested her... My sweet little Iris!Edgeworth:\n(And here I was, convinced HE was the one the police had arrested...) However... I still don't understand what these two items are for.Butz:\nWhat are you talking about?Edgeworth:\nThey're things Wright gave to me when I was leaving his room. (This is the first... He said some nonsense about being able to see into people's hearts with this... And the other... He couldn't possibly be asking what I think he is... could he?)Butz:\nI'm begging you! Iris's trial starts tomorrow! With Nick out of the picture, you're all I've got left! You're the only one that can represent her!Edgeworth:\n... What did you just say?Butz:\nYou know! REPRESENT! DEFEND! What were you expecting!? Why do you think I called you anyway!?Edgeworth:\n...I'm a prosecutor, Larry. A prosecutor. Do YOU understand what I'm saying? A prosecutor is a lawyer who...Butz:\nDon't talk to me like a kid! I graduated from junior high, you know! Don't worry about it! I promise I won't tell!Edgeworth:\nBut I...Butz:\nI mean, I heard a paper badge had no problem fooling an entire court before!Edgeworth:\n(...How could this country's judicial system have fallen into such decay!?)Butz:\nPlease, Edgey! At least listen to her... Listen to Iris's side of the story!Edgeworth:\n(So Wright wasn't joking when he gave me this badge after all...)Iris:\nThank you for coming. ...My name is Iris.Edgeworth:\n...Edgeworth.

Mr. Laurice said that he... That he might even die...Edgeworth:\n... Fortunately, he will be fine. (Larry, you moron! How could you say something like that!?) He was badly bruised when he hit the water, but otherwise he is unharmed.Iris:\n... Thank goodness...Edgeworth:\nBut, he's caught some kind of nasty cold.Iris:\nA cold...?Edgeworth:\nHe's running a high fever and is drifting in and out of consciousness.Iris:\n...Edgeworth:\n(I must be imagining things.

What's that?\nIris:\nIt's a place where those who wish to boost their spiritual power come to train. You need to undergo some very difficult training to release your inner spiritual power.\nEdgeworth:\nSpiritual power...? Did you go to that temple for that reason as well?\nIris:\nNo... I don't have any spiritual powers. I don't need them.\nEdgeworth:\nIn that case, what are you doing at that temple then?\nIris:\n... I... I've committed some sins. Sins that I need to pay for. That's why I'm there, and why I continue to train... To purify my soul.\n\n\n\n\nThe night of the crime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI want to ask you about last night... The night of the crime.\nIris:\nAlright... I helped to clean up after dinner, and then went back to my room at about 8:00. Later, I left my room to ring the lights out bell at 10:00.\nEdgeworth:\nBell...?\nIris:\n...We ring it at the same time each night.\nEdgeworth:\nI see... And then?\nIris:\nA-And then...\nEdgeworth:\n...?\nIris:\nI was told to go to the Training Hall, but... I went back to my room... and stayed there...\nEdgeworth:\nWhy didn't you go to the Training Hall like you were asked to?\nIris:\n...I-I was frightened.\nEdgeworth:\n(\"Frightened\"...?)\nIris:\nSo I just stayed in my room and meditated... until the murder happened.\nEdgeworth:\n(There's more to her story.  I just know there is. Maybe  I should dig a little deeper.)\n\n\n\n\nFrightened? (appears after \"The night of the crime\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou were asked to go to the Training Hall on the night of the murder?\nIris:\nYes...\nEdgeworth:\nHowever... You didn't go. Because you say you were frightened. What exactly were you so frightened of?\nIris:\n...!\n\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Wh-What in the world!?)\nIris:\nUm... Is there something wrong?\nEdgeworth:\n...I'm sorry. It's nothing. (It looks like she's not aware of them herself... These must be what Wright was talking about... The \"Psycholocks\"! I believe he said that I need to present this \"Magatama\" item to do something...)\nIris:\n...?\n\n\n\n\nFrightened? (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nI... I don't like to walk alone at night. And, last night was...\nEdgeworth:\nWhat about last night?\n\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n\nIris:\nEr, oh... nothing. It's rather silly...\nEdgeworth:\nSo there was something special about last night, hmm?\nIris:\nNngh...\nEdgeworth:\n(It looks like I have no choice but to break these locks...)\n\n\n\n\nAny idea? (before clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night?\nIris:\n...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed.\nEdgeworth:\nSpiritual power...?\nIris:\nYes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example...\nEdgeworth:\n...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science. I don't believe in \"spiritual power\".\nIris:\nYes... I understand. Most people don't.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd I am certain that the thing that killed the victim was a human. So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim?\nIris:\n... No. I'm not the one who took her life.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... (That was foolish of me... It's not as if I can know for certain if she is telling me the truth...)\n\n\n\n\nAny idea? (after clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night?\nIris:\n...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed.\nEdgeworth:\nSpiritual power...?\nIris:\nYes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example...\nEdgeworth:\n...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science.

So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim?\nIris:\n... No. I'm not the one who took her life.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... (Those Psycholock things aren't appearing... I suppose that means I can believe that she's not lying.) ...Heh.\nIris:\nWhat's wrong?\nEdgeworth:\n(I can't believe what I'm thinking... And here I just finished saying that I don't believe in spiritual power...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nIs that an attorney's badge?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, this belongs to Wright.\nIris:\nReally?\nEdgeworth:\nI'm actually a prosecutor.\nIris:\nOh...! Then why do you have a defense attorney's badge pinned on your lapel...?\nEdgeworth:\nWell, you see... I, um... I borrowed it.\n\n\n\n\nHanging Scroll\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWho is the woman on this hanging scroll?\nIris:\nWell, I don't know the details, but... I've heard she's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique.\nEdgeworth:\nM-Master?\nIris:\nYes. Mystic Misty. She was a great spirit medium. ...That's what I've heard. I also heard that she went missing over 15 years ago.\nEdgeworth:\n... Spirit mediums... There's no such thing anyway...\nIris:\nMr. Edgeworth...?\nEdgeworth:\nI know all about them... They're nothing but frauds!\nIris:\n...?\nEdgeworth:\n(She doesn't know anything about it, of course... But there was a time, 17 years ago, when I met the \"Master\" myself...)\n\n\n\n\nIris's Hood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nThat's called a \"Demon-Warding Hood\". ...I gave that to Mr. Wright last night.\nEdgeworth:\nHe was wearing this when I saw him at the hospital today.\nIris:\nIt's an important item for protecting acolytes from evil spirits.\nEdgeworth:\nIf it's so important, then why did you give it to him?\nIris:\nLast night... I felt... something... I felt that something terrible was about to happen... I... I didn't want Mr. Wright to fall into its grip.\nEdgeworth:\n(Well he wound up falling into something much deeper and colder... I probably shouldn't say that out loud, though. Thank god for inner monologue.)\n\n\n\n\n\"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\n...I was against the idea of our temple appearing in that magazine. I was afraid that... this type of a tragedy might occur.\nEdgeworth:\nIn that case, why did you allow them to run an article about you?\nIris:\nIt was Sister Bikini... She's actually rather fond of attention... Surprisingly so.\nEdgeworth:\n(She certainly does look rather happy in this photo...)\n\n\n\n\nPhoto of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nThat's Mystic Elise Deauxnim. She's a picture book author, or so I've heard.\nEdgeworth:\nDoes she come to Hazakura Temple often...?\nIris:\nNo... This was her first time. It's just that...\nEdgeworth:\n...?\nIris:\nShe was a very important visitor.\nEdgeworth:\nIs that so?\nIris:\nYes, Sister Bikini told me, \"Be certain not to offend her.\"\nEdgeworth:\n(The victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim... The prosecutor's office still doesn't have much information about her it seems...)\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix Wright profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nMr. Wright... How bad is his cold?\nEdgeworth:\nWell his fever is very high. As a result, he's rather confused. He's worried about Maya, who is still trapped in the Inner Temple... ...And he's quite worried about you as well, it seems.\nIris:\n...Really?\nEdgeworth:\nYes... Naturally, once he recovers, I'll pass the baton back to him.\nIris:\nNo... Don't... I'm sure that Mr. Wright wouldn't want that... He wouldn't want to defend me.\n\n\n\n\nLarry Butz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nOh... That's Mr. Laurice.\nEdgeworth:\n...I'm sorry? Who did you say it was?\nIris:\nLaurice Deauxnim. He is Mystic Elise's apprentice, I think.\nEdgeworth:\n(Alright... Now who exactly is this guy...?)\nIris:\nHe's a very sincere, hard-working person.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nIris:\nUm... Did I say something wrong, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nE-Excuse me. I was temporarily at a loss for words. (Take a trip... Come home... Be thrust suddenly into bizarro world...)\n\n\n\n\nIris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nYou want to know about me? There's not much to tell, I'm afraid.\nEdgeworth:\nJust let me get one thing straight. You were raised at Hazakura Temple, correct? And yet, somehow, you seem to know Wright.\nIris:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nSo you two must have crossed paths somewhere.\nIris:\n...No, Mr. Edgeworth. Whomever it was... ...it couldn't have been me.\nEdgeworth:\n(What is that supposed to mean?)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nI'm sorry... I don't leave the temple grounds very often... So I don't know very much about the outside world.After clearing all Talk options:Edgeworth:\nHmm... It appears that's about all that you can tell me.Iris:\nThank you very much for listening to my story.Edgeworth:\n...I visited Wright at the hospital before coming here. He asked me to take care of you...Iris:\n...M-Me?Edgeworth:\nYes, at the trial tomorrow... He asked me to defend you.Iris:\n... If Mr. Wright has that much faith in you, Mr. Edgeworth... ...Then I will gladly entrust my fate in your capable hands.Edgeworth:\nBut before that, I have one question.Iris:\nYes?Edgeworth:\nDo you know Wright?Iris:\nEr... Wh-Why would you ask that?Edgeworth:\nWhenever you came up in our conversation, he would begin to act a little... strange.Iris:\n... Mr. Edgeworth... What is Mr. Wright to you? (Changed from [Mr. Edgeworth... Are you his friend?] in the original release)Edgeworth:\n...He is a very dear and indispensable friend. (Changed from [Friend? Well... In a sense, yes.] in the original release)Iris:\n... It was 5 years ago... That's when I... That's when I... deceived him.Edgeworth:\nYou \"deceived\" him...?Iris:\nI heard that he was... in a lot of pain after what happened. I know what a weak person I am. That's why... That's why I thought it was best if he never saw me again. I wanted him to just forget about me, without learning the truth.Edgeworth:\n... Well, if you ask me, Wright is still suffering... And until he learns the truth, I don't think he will ever be able to truly recover. ...Iris. It's not too late. You should go to him. ...Tell him the truth.Iris:\n...Edgeworth:\nI'll defend you, but only if you agree to that one condition.Iris:\n... Alright, Mr. Edgeworth... I promise.Edgeworth:\n...Very well. I'll do everything in my power to get you an acquittal. (That's enough information gathering for now. I should head to the crime scene...)February 8Dusky BridgeEdgeworth:\n(It sure is cold alright... So this is it... Dusky Bridge...)???:\nOh, wow! It's you, Mr. Edgeworth! (Changed from [Ahem! M-Mr. Edgeworth!] in the original release)Edgeworth:\nNngh... Detective Gumshoe. (Changed from [Urk... Detective Gumshoe.] in the original release)Gumshoe:\nLong time no see! It's been about a year? ...Or has it been longer?Edgeworth:\nIt doesn't matter, Detective. What does matter is why you're shuffling around up here.Gumshoe:\nOh, ouch! ...And there's that sharp left jab! (Changed from [Oh, ouch! ...And there was a sharp left jab!] in the original release) Well, I'm happy to see you anyway, Mr. Edgeworth!Edgeworth:\nLet me guess... You were transferred by HR to the local precinct? (Changed from [Let me guess... You were transferred into another section at work.] in the original release) A wise decision. The vast amount of nothing up here should be quite easy to guard. (Changed from [A good choice. The vast amount of nothing up here must be quite easy to guard.] in the original release)Gumshoe:\nI heard you were back in the country and arranged to come all the way out here! Everybody was real nice. They even let me take charge of the investigation, sir.Edgeworth:\n(...Gumshoe indeed! Like gum on your shoe, he's impossible to get rid of!)Gumshoe:\nI'm supposed to report on the details of the crime scene, sir! Anyway! Here I am! Detective Dick Gumshoe! Reporting for duty!Edgeworth:\n...Great. Um, thank you, Detective.Gumshoe:\nI thought Prosecutor Godot was gonna get here before me. That guy's a real mystery, I tell you!Edgeworth:\n(...Prosecutor Godot?)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCliff on other side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt looks like a pretty good distance to that far cliff.\nGumshoe:\nYeah... It's gotta be around 100 yards or so.\nEdgeworth:\n... Detective... That's not even CLOSE to a hundred yards.\nGumshoe:\nWell... I gotta admit I'm not very good at judging distances.\nEdgeworth:\n(It's about 20 yards or so. And impossible to cross without a bridge, it seems...)\n\n\n\n\nWooden sign on left side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThere's a little shack down that way called, \"Heavenly Hall\".\nEdgeworth:\nA shack...?\nGumshoe:\nIt's like a run-down doghouse for losers that can't bear the freezing drafts of wind... Kinda reminds me of my apartment, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nThe name \"Heavenly Hall\" makes it sound like a palace...\nGumshoe:\nGiving a hovel a great name is a crime itself! I'd call it false advertising! By the way, the name of my apartment complex is \"Compton Castles\"...\nEdgeworth:\n...That's not such a great name, if you ask me.\nGumshoe:\nWell, it's not such a great apartment either, sir.\n\n\n\n\nBridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo this is the bridge Wright tried to cross?\nGumshoe:\nPretty reckless, if you ask me.\nEdgeworth:\nI'm amazed he survived the fall from up here...\nGumshoe:\nYeah, he's one lucky guy, sir. Now I see how he manages to win his cases in court. Blind luck.\nEdgeworth:\n(I think dumb luck suits Wright just a bit better.)\n\n\n\n\nBoulder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSome letters are wildly engraved into a roughly cut boulder. \"Dusky Bridge\"... It certainly is an appropriate name.\nGumshoe:\nYou need to get some glasses, Mr. Edgeworth! That sign says, \"Dusty Bridge\". I can see how you read it wrong, though, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nYou're the one who needs glasses, Detective. Try reading it one more time.\nGumshoe:\n... Ah! You're right! It's \"Dusky Bridge\" after all! ... I guess whoever wrote this made a mistake!\n\n\n\n\nPublic phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nHey! It's a public phone! You don't see a lot of these anymore!\nEdgeworth:\n...That's true.\nGumshoe:\nSince we've got one here, why don't we take a photo as a memento!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, um, sure. Why not?\nGumshoe:\nOh, darn it! I don't have a camera with me! ...I'm gonna go buy a disposable camera! I'll be right back, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n(What's so special about public phones, and why is he so fascinated by them...?)Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened (before visitng Main Hall)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case...\nGumshoe:\nIt's simple!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, simple is as simple does, as they say.\nGumshoe:\nOh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing!\nEdgeworth:\nA witness...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that Bikini lady.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Bikini lady\"? Here? On this freezing cold mountain?\nGumshoe:\n...Well, you should talk to her yourself if you want the details, sir.\nEdgeworth:\n(I may have to talk to this \"bikini lady\"... I mean, \"decisive witness\" myself...)\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened (after visitng Main Hall)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case...\nGumshoe:\nIt's simple!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, simple is as simple does, as they say.\nGumshoe:\nOh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing!\nEdgeworth:\nA witness...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that Bikini lady.\n\n\n\n\nDusky Bridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo this is the bridge that Wright fell through?\nGumshoe:\nYup! I can't imagine being that reckless myself... \"Look before you cross,\" is how it goes, right? Or was that \"leap\"...?\nEdgeworth:\nAnd? Is there something on the other side?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, some old building they call the Inner Temple... But we can't get over there without a bridge, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat...?\nGumshoe:\nNobody lives there, so it's usually not a problem... But someone was at the Inner Temple doing some training and now they're stuck there.\nEdgeworth:\nYes, I heard that from Wright. It's Maya Fey.\nGumshoe:\nOh no... Her again...? Anyway, the air's really turbulent right now so we can't do an aerial extraction. No one's gonna be able to reach the Inner Temple until tomorrow, sir.\nEdgeworth:\n(Will she be alright in this cold...?) So how did this bridge burn down anyway?\nGumshoe:\nWe're almost 100% sure it was lightning.\nEdgeworth:\n...Lightning?\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor Godot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo who is this Prosecutor Godot? I've never heard of him.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, he's a new guy... Showed up after you left the country! He's a complete rookie, but nobody can say a bad word about the guy.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat kind of a man is he?\nGumshoe:\nHe just became a prosecutor recently, but he's good, sir. Real good.\nEdgeworth:\n(If he's so good, how is it that I've never heard of him...?) Is he the lead prosecutor on this case?\nGumshoe:\nYou bet he is! After all, \"you know who\" is right in the middle of it.\nEdgeworth:\n\"You know who\"?\nGumshoe:\nPhoenix Wright, of course! For some reason, Godot has really got it in for Mr. Wright!\nEdgeworth:\nOh?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, he seems to have some kind of a grudge.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd what would be the cause of this grudge...?\nGumshoe:\nI dunno... Maybe he made fun of his mask or something.\nEdgeworth:\n(None of this is making any sense. I'd better look into this Godot myself.)\n\n\n\n\nLightning (appears after \"Dusky Bridge\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning?\nGumshoe:\nYup. Last night it snowed for the first time in 3 days. It's a little unusual for lightning to occur during a snow fall like that... But according to the weather data, lightning definitely struck.\nWeather Data added to the Court Record.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm, I see... This is a very detailed weather report... Almost too detailed... It even has the exact time that the lightning struck the bridge...\nGumshoe:\nOh, that? We got that information from the witness's testimony.\nEdgeworth:\nSomeone actually saw the lightning hit the bridge? Who is this witness?\nGumshoe:\n... Sorry. I'll go ask one of the local cops later, sir.\n\n\n\n\nLightning (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning?\nGumshoe:\nYup.

What's that thing doing on your lapel, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n...Is it really that odd?\nGumshoe:\nYou bet it is, sir! A prosecutor wearing a defense attorney's badge? That's like a detective with a license to kill!\nEdgeworth:\n(Does this little thing hold that ominous of a meaning...?)\n\n\n\n\nMagatama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHave you ever seen this thing before...?\nGumshoe:\nHey, thanks a lot. I was getting kind of hungry! ...*chomp!*\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What are you doing, Detective!?\nGumshoe:\nAck! ...I thought it was some kind of candy that would fill me up, sir. Lately I've been feeling so hungry all the time...\nEdgeworth:\n(Nngh... Maybe his salary has been cut just a little too much...?)\n\n\n\n\nPhoto of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThere's a lot we don't know about this victim... We don't know her real name, her background... We don't know anything really.\nEdgeworth:\nThat's rather odd... If she was trying to hide her identity, why would she become an author?\nGumshoe:\nI'll bet it was just one of those things. You know... She probably never expected to get so popular.\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix Wright profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nWhenever something happens, this guy always shows up like he hasn't got a care. In fact, you know what...? Every time he shows up, I always wonder the same thing. \"Maybe somehow he's actually the cause of all these incidents!\"\nEdgeworth:\n(I wonder if Gumshoe has realized it yet... But you could say the exact the same thing about him!)\n\n\n\n\nDick Gumshoe profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYour face is more drawn out than the last time I saw you over a year ago.\nGumshoe:\nR-Really? I thought so!\nEdgeworth:\nNo, wait... It's not so much \"drawn out\", as \"weary and tired\", or maybe just plain old \"thin\".\nGumshoe:\nI thought that too, sir. My salary's been kinda on the low end... So yeah, my food options have been kinda non-existent. Off-brand chicken soup, off-brand spaghetti, off-brand bread... That sort of stuff.\nEdgeworth:\nI thought you were really into instant noodles last year...?\nGumshoe:\n...I got really sick of the stuff after a while, sir.\n\n\n\n\nLarry Butz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nHe's supposed to be Ms. Elise Deauxnim's apprentice or something.\nEdgeworth:\n...I see.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, he drew a nice portrait of me.\nEdgeworth:\n...That's nice.\nGumshoe:\nBut he made me pay him 50 cents for it.\nEdgeworth:\n...I'm sorry about that.\nGumshoe:\n... You don't seem very interested in him, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\n...I really don't want to talk about him. That's why.\n\n\n\n\nIris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI feel like I've seen this girl somewhere before! She wasn't from a prior case, was she?\nGumshoe:\nNope, can't be. We did a database search with her fingerprints and came up with nothing.\nEdgeworth:\nI see... (I just can't shake this nagging feeling...)\nGumshoe:\nWell, everyone knows that you are quite popular with the ladies, sir... Maybe she's an old girlfriend that you sent to Dumpsville when you were younger.\nEdgeworth:\nD-Detective! Where did you hear such nonsense from!?\nGumshoe:\nI didn't hear it from anyone. It's just sorta how I imagine you to be... sir.\nEdgeworth:\n(...D-Do I really inspire this sort of frothing desire from the female masses?)\n\n\n\n\nGodot profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI usually hear about promising young prosecutor candidates while they're still in school. But I've never seen or heard of this person.\nGumshoe:\nI gotta admit... He's puzzling alright. He just appeared one day, big mug of steaming coffee in his hand...\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... He sounds like an interesting man...\nGumshoe:\nYeah... The whole prosecutor's office is really into double espresso macchiatos lately.\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nLook, I'm just your everyday, simple detective. Don't ask me such tough questions, OK?\nEdgeworth:\n...That's not something to be proud of, Detective!February 8Detention CenterVisitor's RoomEdgeworth:\n(It looks like Iris is being interrogated right now.) ...This place certainly brings back memories.Gumshoe:\nOh yeah. Come to think of it, you got thrown in here once too, didn't you, sir? But you know what? I've never been in jail a single time!Edgeworth:\n(I should think it's hard to land in jail when you're so harmless...) Yes, well... If you're in jail, you don't have to pay for your own meals, you know.Gumshoe:\n...*gasp!* ...Edgeworth:\nDon't get any funny ideas, Detective...!Gumshoe:\n...Too late, I already did.Edgeworth:\n(In any case... I guess I'll have to come back here later...)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurveillance camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThat camera is meant to monitor everything that happens in here. And right now, it's pointed straight at the guard.\n\n\n\n\nGuard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe guard is staring at me with a puzzled expression on his face. Me... and the badge on my lapel. ...I get the feeling he recognizes me.February 8Hazakura TempleMain GateButz:\nYo! Edgey! What took you so long!? I'm so cold, my brain's turned to sherbet.Edgeworth:\n...I knew it was a mistake to race back to this country.Butz:\nWh-What do you mean...?Edgeworth:\nWright is going to be fine, and the case itself isn't anything unusual... And I find myself taking a request to defend a woman accused of murder!Gumshoe:\n...H-Hey! Wait a sec! Hold it! Objection! What's going on here, Mr. Edgeworth!?Edgeworth:\nUm, it's hard to explain, but one thing led to another and...Butz:\nWhat kind of lame excuse is that!? And you call yourself a defense attorney!?Gumshoe:\nProsecutor Edgeworth is a prosecutor, and that's why he's Prosecutor Edgeworth! \"Prosecutor Edgeworth, Defense Attorney\" just sounds plain old weird, pal! ...Right, Prosecutor Edgeworth!?Edgeworth:\n(...I'm not sure what role I'm supposed to be playing anymore.)Butz:\nHmph!

I just know it, OK!? So trust me on this one!Edgeworth:\nEver the romantic, aren't you, Larry? Nevertheless, I'll do whatever I can to prove her innocence.

You got a real flair for words, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nI have always appreciated this kind of old, timeless elegance.\nGumshoe:\nThat's exactly how I feel, too! Take this coat for example! Like a fine wine, it gets better with age!\nEdgeworth:\nEven fine wine turns to vinegar and begins to stink at some point. ...I suggest you wash that atrocious rag you call a coat, Detective.\n\n\n\n\nMain Hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThat must be the Main Hall back there.\nGumshoe:\nA brilliant deduction, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n............ Are you trying to flatter me, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nUmm... A brilliant use of suspense to build the tension, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n(According to Wright, the head nun has some important information. I can't miss the opportunity to speak with her...)\n\n\n\n\nBell tower\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI can see a small bell tower from here.\nGumshoe:\nHey, that just reminded me! There's something I've always wondered about...\nEdgeworth:\n(Something tells me he's going to tell me what's on his mind, whether I like it or not...)\nGumshoe:\nWe call a person who tells a lie a \"liar\", right? So why don't we call a person who rings a bell a \"beller\"? Or \"truer\" for a guy who tells the truth! Oh man, I'm not gonna get any sleep tonight!\nEdgeworth:\n(I had no idea he was such a deep thinker...)\n\n\n\n\nSnowmobile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI suppose this type of thing is necessary up here in the mountains.\nGumshoe:\nSay, this just gave me a great idea!\nEdgeworth:\n(Something tells me he's going to tell me what's on his mind, whether I like it or not...)\nGumshoe:\nI've got an idea for a brand new invention! It might even make me rich!\nEdgeworth:\nAn invention...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah! A car that can travel on snow! I'll call it a \"Snow Car\"!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nGumshoe:\nSo what do you think, sir? Would you go for a ride on something like that?\nEdgeworth:\n...Only after you take the first 1000 test rides.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nMan, I'm telling you. Iris is so cute! Right, Edgey? You think so too, don't you?\nEdgeworth:\n...\nButz:\nWhat's wrong? Why are you so quiet?\nEdgeworth:\nTo put it simply...Your comment has me highly concerned. Could it be that the reason you think she's innocent...\nButz:\nCome on! A girl that cute can't possibly be a murderer!\nEdgeworth:\n... ...I was right after all. I should never have come back.\nButz:\nNo, no! Don't worry! I see things for how they really are this time! Honest!\nEdgeworth:\n(If I had a penny for every time he's said that...)\nButz:\nIt's just that... Well, Iris is a delicate flower. You can't force things too much. Know what I mean?\nEdgeworth:\nHuh...? I have no idea what you're talking about, Larry.\nButz:\nOh. ...Ah! Err. Forget it.

I'm just a 25 year old jobless bum trying to be an apprentice artist!\nEdgeworth:\n(If that's what you think, then get a job already!)\nButz:\nD-Don't look at me like that! I thought we were pals!\n\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n\nEdgeworth:\nIf we're friends then I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't hide the truth from me!\nButz:\nHmph, well... Sure... It's like, you know!

After all, I saved his life.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is that supposed to mean?\nButz:\nIf I hadn't called for help so quickly, he would have died. It's no surprise though. I used to be a security guard. It was all instinct, baby!\nEdgeworth:\n(He has a point... He called me pretty quickly, too... I think Larry's pretty good at motivating people. I just wish he would try motivating himself once in a while!)\n\n\n\n\nLarry Butz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nHuh? Me?

You were a guy once! Lots of girls are like Iris. You know I'm right!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, you most certainly seem to have convinced yourself!\nButz:\nMan, I love shy girls like her!

A handsome boy such as yourself is always welcome! *sigh* If circumstances weren't so tragic, I might just...Edgeworth:\n(Please don't call me \"boy\".) I'm sorry to trouble you... But I'm looking for a woman in a bikini.Bikini:\nWell, you have found her. Now, what can I do for you?Edgeworth:\n... I'm sorry, but I don't see any bikinis...Bikini:\nHa ha ha! If you ask nicely, I might give you a peek, big boy. Wa ha ha ho ho ho!Gumshoe:\nUmm... Mr. Edgeworth? This is the head nun, Sister Bikini... She's the witness.Edgeworth:\n... Why didn't you tell me that earlier!? This is exactly why your salary keeps on getting cut!Gumshoe:\nNngh... My stomach is already growling in protest...Bikini:\nSo... Um... What's the latest about my beloved Iris!?Edgeworth:\nWell, first... I want to hear what you know.Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWalls or sliding doors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere's flowing script written everywhere on the walls.\nGumshoe:\nMan, I'd bet you'd have awful nightmares if you tried to sleep in here.\nBikini:\nThis is our Main Hall, so it's protected by a variety of magic spells and charms... They're all designed to prevent evil forces from entering.\nGumshoe:\nSo if I slept here the uggie-woogie-boogieman wouldn't hunt me down for eternity? Alright!\nEdgeworth:\n(Does this guy think about anything other than eating and sleeping...?)\n\n\n\n\nObjects on floor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nOh! It's a warmed cat box! But where are all the cats?\nEdgeworth:\n...It's called a \"hibachi\". It's for heating the room.\nGumshoe:\nOh! Look at all these ancient straw frisbees!\nEdgeworth:\nThose are a type of \"zabuton\" cushions called \"enza\"!\nGumshoe:\n... Why are you giving me such a hard time? Huh, Mr. Edgeworth? Why?\nEdgeworth:\nBecause learning something new might actually be a good thing for you, Detective!\n\n\n\n\nAltar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt's an altar with a giant Magatama enshrined on it.\nGumshoe:\nThere are lots of candles lined up on it, too. You know... I haven't had a birthday party for myself in a while...\nEdgeworth:\nMaybe you should blow out those candles over there to make up for that.\nGumshoe:\nMr. Edgeworth? Would you mind singing \"Happy Birthday\" to me?\nBikini:\nS-Stop that! Cut that out! Please don't blow out the altar candles!\n\n\n\n\nMagatama on altar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...That thing sure casts a strong presence over the whole room.\nBikini:\nThis is the \"Lesser Magatama\". It's a precious heirloom containing a great many souls.\nGumshoe:\nHuh...!? This is \"lesser\"!? What is the \"greater\" one like?\nBikini:\nThe \"Greater Magatama\" is displayed in the Main Room of Fey Manor. It was supposed to be shown at the Treasures of Kurain exhibit... But, it was so large that they couldn't bring it through the doors.\n\n\n\n\nLeft corner near altar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(There are more enza cushions in the corner of the room.) ...What's that white piece of paper sticking out from under that stack...?\nGumshoe:\nHmm... Beats me.\nEdgeworth:\nWould you mind checking that for me, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir! Here you are, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nIt looks like an old manila envelope...\nGumshoe:\nEeeeeeeeeeaaaah!!\nEdgeworth:\n...What is it, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nTh-This... This could be it! An ultra important clue! A super-special clue!\nEdgeworth:\n...I suppose I should read it myself then.\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like a letter addressed to Sister Iris. \"tonight at 10 at Heavenly Hall. ... ...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed.\"\nEdgeworth:\nTh-This sounds like a blackmail letter...!\nNote to Iris added to the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\nNice going there, Mr. Edgeworth! Why can't I ever find clues like that!? You're an ultra-important prosecutor!! A super-duper prosecutor!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, I suppose it takes a super-duper kind of dumb to miss a clue like this.\n\n\n\n\nLeft corner near altar (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(There are more enza cushions in the corner of the room.)\nGumshoe:\nNice going there, Mr. Edgeworth!

After dinner, the two of us went to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple.\nEdgeworth:\n(She must be talking about Maya...) Approximately what time was that...?\nBikini:\nI suppose it was about 9:00 when we left here. Training lasts all night long. It's extremely exhausting. The channeling dojo's Head Nun must be in attendance at all times to keep watch.\nGumshoe:\nWow, you're right! That does sound exhausting!\nEdgeworth:\nDetective, this is no time for flattery.\nGumshoe:\nSorry.\nEdgeworth:\nSome time around 11:00, you witnessed the incident in the courtyard. But your duty was in the Inner Temple. Why did you come back here?\nBikini:\nHmm... The way you're staring at me, I'm starting to get goosebumps! Ha ha ha ho ho!\nEdgeworth:\n(Nngh... I'm starting to get goosebumps myself, but for a decidedly different reason.)\nGumshoe:\nHo ho, you get the chills pretty easy, don't you Mr. Edgeworth?\n\n\n\n\nWhat you saw\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAlright then... I'd like you to tell me exactly what you saw in the courtyard.\nBikini:\nIt must have been past 11:00. Ah! No! I can't say it! It-It's too much for my poor heart!\nGumshoe:\nHey! Calm down, lady! L-Let go of my tie!\nBikini:\n...I saw two people! One of them was lying on the ground... Th-The other one was stabbing her from the back... with a sword!\nEdgeworth:\nDid you see this criminal with your own eyes?\nBikini:\nI didn't want to believe what I was seeing...! ...But it was Iris!\nEdgeworth:\nYou must have been quite shocked.\nGumshoe:\nOf course she was! Try putting yourself in her shoes! It'd be like if you were stabbing Mr. Wright smack in the middle of a courtroom! And I happened to witness it from the witness stand! ...I'd be pretty shocked too.\nBikini:\nI know it sounds insane... But that's what I saw. And when I finally realized what I was seeing, I screamed, and then... I passed out.\nEdgeworth:\n(...Unfortunately for us, her testimony seems to be pretty solid.)\nBikini:\nHowever... The idea of Iris doing such a foul act seems... unnatural.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Unnatural\"...?\nBikini:\nThe girl I know simply isn't capable of this sort of foulness...\nEdgeworth:\n(...I wonder what she means by that?)\n\n\n\n\nWhy return? (appears after \"The night of the crime\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAs the head nun, it's your duty to stay with the acolyte at all times, correct?\nBikini:\nYes, that's correct. I know I may look strong, but the truth is... I've got a bad lower back.\nEdgeworth:\nA bad lower back...?\nBikini:\nYes, it's especially bad in the winter. So bad that I can't even lift a bucket. Do you remember how cold it was last night? My bad back felt as stiff as frozen glass. I just wanted to take a nice hot bath to ease my aching back... That's why I returned to the Main Hall.\nEdgeworth:\nSo you left the disciple all alone?\nBikini:\nDon't be ridiculous! I would never do that! That's why I ordered Iris to the Inner Temple after she had rung the bell for lights out.\nEdgeworth:\n(Yes, but she never went to the Inner Temple, did she? So did this head nun actually see Iris there? (Changed from [Did this head nun even see Iris?] in the original release) I think I'd better try to get some more details...)\n\n\n\n\nThe acolyte (appears after \"What you saw\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo who is this acolyte that was to train at the Inner Temple...?\nBikini:\nHer name is Maya Fey... I treated her very badly, I'm ashamed to say. And after she went through the trouble of signing up for the Special Course...\nGumshoe:\n\"Special Course\"?\nBikini:\nIt's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant 30,000 times...\nEdgeworth:\nYou don't mean to tell me she's still doing that over at the Inner Temple, do you?\nBikini:\nNo, no, no. Of course not! You don't have to worry about that one little bit. Last night, we still hadn't started the training session itself.\nEdgeworth:\nWell, um... That's good to hear.\nBikini:\n...Oh! Dear, dear! There's one thing I forgot to tell you.\nGumshoe:\n...Uh-oh, I don't think I like the sound of this.\nBikini:\nDo you know that small girl? I believe she is Mystic Maya's little sister.\nEdgeworth:\n(Maya has a little sister...?)\nGumshoe:\nOh, you mean little Pearl! That's Maya Fey's cousin.\nEdgeworth:\nLittle... Pearl...?\nBikini:\nI thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after we'd finished with dinner cleanup... (Changed from [I thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after cleaning up dinner...] in the original release) But I haven't seen her at all since late last night! She's nowhere to be found!\nEdgeworth:\nY-You mean she...!? She was with the victim!?\nBikini:\nIt's all the fault of my stupid, creaky old back!\nEdgeworth:\n(A little girl who was with the victim on the night of the murder... is gone!)\nGumshoe:\nAs they say... \"The plot thickens!\"Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagatama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nTh-That's...! That's one of the Fey clan's very own Magatamas! That's a priceless treasure you've got there!\nGumshoe:\nW...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me!\nBikini:\nYes... You don't look it, but now I can see you're a real fan of the occult!\nEdgeworth:\nExcuse me?\nBikini:\nOh, of course this piece couldn't possibly be real, but to have such a nice replica... Clearly, you are a big fan of the Kurain Tradition!\nGumshoe:\nW...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me!\nEdgeworth:\n(I should have known better than to show this thing around...)\n\n\n\n\nHanging Scroll\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nHuh... Ahh! Well, well, well... Look what you've found! That's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, Mystic Misty Fey!\nEdgeworth:\n\"Fey\"...\nBikini:\nIt's been nearly 20 years since Mystic Misty's disappearance. Apparently, she intended to pass on the Master title to her daughter.\nEdgeworth:\nWho is this daughter?\nBikini:\nWell, I myself am part of a branch family of the Fey clan. But even I am not privy to information concerning the main family...\n\n\n\n\nIris's Hood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nWell, well, well! That's a Demon-Warding Hood! Acolytes are highly susceptible to possession by evil spirits, you know. That's why we always wear these for protection.\nEdgeworth:\nOh, I see...\nBikini:\nWhat are you waiting for? You won't get any protection just by holding it, you know! Put it on already!\nEdgeworth:\nNo! I can't...! I was just...!\nBikini:\n... Ha ha ha ho ho ho!\nGumshoe:\nHo ho ho! It's like it was made just for you, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean by that, Detective!?\nBikini:\nIt looks absolutely marvelous!

Cult!\" New Year's Issue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAbout this picture...\nBikini:\nWell look at that! I look pretty s-to-the-exy, don't you think!?\nGumshoe:\nUm, ah... Y-Yeah. Absolutely.\nBikini:\nUp until recently, we've avoided exposure in such magazines. But this time we had our reasons...\nEdgeworth:\nIs that so? For exampl--?\nBikini:\nHa ha ha ha ha!!! Well, why deny the world the sight of such a lovely face!?\n\n\n\n\nPhoto of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\n...Ohhhh! H-How could such a... terrible thing have happened...? It's all... It's all... It's all my fault!\nGumshoe:\nWell come on, lady... I don't think you need to take all the blame yourself.\nBikini:\nQuiet! What do you know anyway!?\nGumshoe:\n...Ouch. You're scary!\nBikini:\nWith that stupid 5 o'clock shadow and that stupid old coat of yours... It's too bad that you weren't the one that disappeared!\nGumshoe:\n... ...Why does she have to take it all out on me?\nEdgeworth:\n(Her anger does seem a little... manufactured.)\n\n\n\n\nNote to Iris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nDo you know anything about this old, crumpled-up letter?\nBikini:\n... Is that addressed to Iris?\nGumshoe:\nYup, it clearly says \"To Iris\" on it.\nBikini:\nI can't believe it... That girl doesn't have any secrets from me...\nEdgeworth:\n(Ah... So Sister Bikini didn't know anything about it...)\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix Wright profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nThis man... His face betrays a life of suffering and great weariness of the world.\nEdgeworth:\n...Um, sure.\nBikini:\nBut even so... I can't believe this guy actually jumped into the river! Think of all the fun things he might have enjoyed if he had just lived... Relentless spiritual training alone is no way to lead a complete life, huh...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n(It sounds like she's got some major regrets she's dealing with... Hmm... Perhaps I should let Gumshoe explain Wright's situation to her for me...)\nGumshoe:\nH-Hey! Don't look at me like that! Do you own dirty work! ...Sir!\n\n\n\n\nLarry Butz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nThis is Mystic Elise's apprentice, is it not? I think he might have a bit of a crush on me... Sweet boy at any rate.\nGumshoe:\nHuh?\nBikini:\nOh, I don't blame him. Sister Bikini understands the temptations of young men.\nEdgeworth:\n...Sure.\nBikini:\nBut I'm afraid it wouldn't be proper to abuse my position. I am head nun, after all. But, in return, I did allow him to draw a portrait of me.\nEdgeworth:\n(I pray it was a pose that maintained your modesty. For everyone's sake...)\n\n\n\n\nIris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou said you went with Maya to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple last night. Did you happen to see Iris while you were there?\nBikini:\nOf course I saw her. I told her to meet us after ringing the 10:00 bell for lights out.\nGumshoe:\nSo you're saying Iris came to the Inner Temple then?\nBikini:\nOf course she did. Iris has always been a good, obedient girl. After that, I had Maya begin her training ceremony.\nEdgeworth:\n(But that doesn't fit with Iris's story at all... She said that she never went to the Inner Temple!)\nGumshoe:\nAs they say... \"The plot thickens!\"\n\n\n\n\nBikini profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nIt's all my fault... Me and my stupid back! Mystic Elise has been murdered, an important acolyte is trapped... ...and a little girl has been lost!\nGumshoe:\nYou know you really shouldn't be so negative. It creates bad karma...\nBikini:\n...Quite right. I need to do some more training myself, I think...\n\n\n\n\nMaya Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nShe's a very important visitor, you know! An honored acolyte!\nEdgeworth:\n\"Honored\"? How so?\nBikini:\nThe Fey name is synonymous with the Kurain Channeling Technique. Therefore, she must be a spirit medium of great power indeed.\nGumshoe:\nNow that you mention it, one year ago... ...there was a case that was about the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique!\nEdgeworth:\n...Detective. I detest talk of supernatural drivel. I suppose now you'll say she has midi-chlorians?\nGumshoe:\nHo ho ho. So it gives you the creeps, huh, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n(...That's got nothing to do with it.)\n\n\n\n\nPearl Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nOh, this poor girl... Where could she have gone...?\nGumshoe:\nWell, we checked out her home and she's not there.\nBikini:\nAnd she's nowhere in the vicinity of the temple either...\nEdgeworth:\n(Which means... ...there's only a few other possibilities as to where she could be.)\nGumshoe:\nAh! Do you think maybe she fell off the bridge and was carried downstream...!?\nEdgeworth:\n... Why do you have to be such a pessimist, Detective!?\nGumshoe:\nNngh... I was just trying to think like you, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\n(Ironic. I became a pessimist only after I had the pleasure of working with you!)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nUmm, about this here...\nBikini:\nHmm... Let me see... Well, as you may know... In order to see reality for what it truly is... ...we strive to break our attachments to much of the transient, material realm. I guess you could call me an \"immaterial girl\"!\nGumshoe:\nI guess she lives in an immaterial world, huh Mr. Edgeworth?Main Gate (before clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nI'm just no good with people like her.

Don't you think you're expecting a little too much of me? I'm just a 25 year old jobless bum trying to be an apprentice artist!

Are you really gonna defend that nun, Iris, at the trial tomorrow?Edgeworth:\nYes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitment. (Changed from [Yes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitments.] in the original release)Gumshoe:\nWell, in that case... I've gotta be careful... Gotta make sure I don't leak the prosecution's whole investigation...Edgeworth:\nDon't worry about it, Detective. Just keep your mouth closed and I think most of it will flow out on its own.Gumshoe:\n... You got it, sir! I'll make sure it flows out like water from a tap! (Changed from [Roger, sir!

You're right! But I'm pretty sure the Main Hall didn't have a 2nd floor.\nEdgeworth:\nHazakura Temple was built on a steep part of the mountain. The front and back of the Main Hall are on different levels.\nGumshoe:\nOh... That makes sense...

Let's see if we can summarize what we've learned so far.\nGumshoe:\nOK! Let's take a look at the map. ...According to the testimony of Sister Bikini, the head nun... ...right after they'd finished dinner, she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple. (Changed from [...she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple right after dinner was finished.] in the original release) At 10 PM, after ringing the bell for lights out, Iris went to the Inner Temple. When she got there, Bikini had her take over while she went back to Hazakura Temple. After taking a hot bath to soothe her back... ...Sister Bikini witnessed the murder in the courtyard! If you want more details, you should ask Bikini herself in the Main Hall.\nEdgeworth:\n(The Inner Temple, huh...? I'd like some more information about that place...)\n\n\n\n\nTomorrow's trial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe trial begins tomorrow, but who's the prosecutor?\nGumshoe:\nI'm pretty sure it's that Godot guy, but... ...nobody can get a hold of him, so they're looking for a replacement.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean...?\nGumshoe:\nIt's really weird. All of a sudden, no one can reach him! Hmm, I wonder if the rumors are true. Maybe since Mr. Wright caught a cold and won't be defending, he just lost interest.\nEdgeworth:\nI intend to appear in court in the role of defense lawyer. However... I would be quite unhappy if it came out that I'm actually a prosecutor.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, I can see why. But I'm not the one you have to worry about... I think the real problem is gonna be that judge...\nEdgeworth:\n...Yes, he certainly would remember my face, even after such a long absence. That's why I requested another judge preside over the case. We've only met each other once. There's a good chance he won't remember me at all.\nGumshoe:\nY-Yeah, but... what about the prosecutor? Everyone in the prosecutor's office must know you! Wouldn't it be a problem if someone there made a big stink, sir?\nEdgeworth:\nThere's no need to worry. I pulled a few strings and arranged for a prosecutor of my own choosing.\nGumshoe:\nWow, Mr. Edgeworth... I had no idea you had such a powerful string to pull!\n\n\n\n\nInner Temple (appears after \"What happened\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this Inner Temple that Maya was supposedly training at...?\nGumshoe:\nAccording to Bikini, it's an old building they use for training the acolytes. It's on the other side of Dusky Bridge.\nEdgeworth:\n(The bridge that burned down, huh...) Is there anything else on the other side of that bridge besides the Inner Temple?\nGumshoe:\nNope, not a thing.\nEdgeworth:\nNothing?\nGumshoe:\nThe other side is surrounded by cliffs on all sides... In a way, it's kinda like a little island out there.\nEdgeworth:\n(So the only thing there is the Inner Temple...)\nGumshoe:\nI hear it's not the kind of place a person could survive in.\nEdgeworth:\n(Please be alright, Maya...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictim's Staff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nOh, so I think I might have already told you about this, but... The truth is... When I was a little kid...\nEdgeworth:\nYou wanted to become a wizard, right?\nGumshoe:\nHey, that's amazing! How did you know that!? So? What do you think? I'd make a really great one, don't you think?\nEdgeworth:\nWe just had this conversation a little while ago, Detective!\n\n\n\n\nShichishito\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThis sword represents the multiple branches that life can take, all ending as one.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... I've never heard that one.\nGumshoe:\nYou know what I think about sometimes? What kind of life would I have had if I hadn't joined the Homicide Division.\nEdgeworth:\n...So you think about that kind of thing too, huh?\nGumshoe:\nOf course I do. I think about it a lot. Me as a traffic cop. Me as a detention officer. Me as the Blue Badger...\nEdgeworth:\n(...I guess he doesn't have any plans to leave the force.)\n\n\n\n\nBikini profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThis is the witness who saw the crime take place out there in the temple courtyard. I'm pretty sure it's gonna be her testimony that'll be key to this case, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nSo you mean she's going to be a witness in the trial tomorrow...?\nGumshoe:\nOf course! A nun is as trustworthy as you can get! We got this one in the bag! ... Oh. I-I mean, I've always been on your side, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! So yeah, this is a pretty tight spot we've gotten ourselves into, huh!?\nEdgeworth:\n(Now I understand why Wright is always breaking into a cold sweat...)\n\n\n\n\nMaya Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI wonder if Maya is alright? I could never show my face to Wright again if something were to happen to her.\nGumshoe:\nAww, it'll be OK. If that ever happens, you can just show him my face. How's that...?\nEdgeworth:\n...\nGumshoe:\nAck! Um, I didn't mean it like that, sir! It was just a silly little joke!\nEdgeworth:\nI wonder if there is another way to get across to the other side? The support wires for the bridge are still intact, correct?\nGumshoe:\nThat bridge is almost 20 yards long... I know I may look like it, Mr. Edgeworth, but I'm no super hero.\nEdgeworth:\n(In any case, I just hope Maya is alright...)\n\n\n\n\nPearl Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat about Pearl...? Has no one seen her at all since last night?\nGumshoe:\nSeems that way... Apparently, she hasn't gone back to Kurain Village either, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nBut it's true that she was with Elise Deauxnim at some point last night?\nGumshoe:\nNo doubt about it. Ah...! Y-You mean that maybe whoever killed Ms. Deauxnim also...!?\nEdgeworth:\nD-Don't jump to any crazy conclusions!\nGumshoe:\nOooooouuuch! ...You sure have one mean punch, Mr. Edgeworth! It's down-right fierce!After clearing all Talk options in Dusky Bridge, clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate, clearing all Talk options and examining left corner near altar in Hazakura Temple - Main Hall, and clearing all Talk options and examining staff and Ami Fey statue in Hazakura Temple - Courtyard:February 8Detention CenterVisitor's RoomIris:\nAh...

Where is it on this map...?\nIris:\n...It's around here. To get there, you must follow a small path down from Dusky Bridge... The reality is, to get to the Inner Temple, I had no choice but to cross that bridge. But the thought that such a terrible criminal could be lurking at Heavenly Hall... I...

She said that when Maya Fey began her training at the Inner Temple... ...you were there as well.\nIris:\nWhat...!?\nEdgeworth:\nWhen I spoke with you last, you claimed that you never went to the Inner Temple. And yet, Sister Bikini says she met with you at the Inner Temple that very night.\nIris:\nB-But I... I didn't go there! I didn't go to the Inner Temple last night.\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm...

That's why I'm committed to searching until I have those answers. Now then, is it really true that you didn't go to the Inner Temple last night...?\nIris:\nY-Yes, I swear... I already told you that.\nEdgeworth:\n...Yes. You said you didn't go because you were frightened.\nIris:\n...Th-That's right.\nEdgeworth:\nIf that's the case... ...then the obvious question is, \"What were you so afraid of?\"\nIris:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nIris...

(Changed from [I even chased one of them to Tibet... Next it's going to be prison, I guess.] in the original release) ...I'll steal that detective's wallet. That'll get me locked up for sure. ...Nah. I can't do that to someone who looks like he's down on his luck.Gumshoe:\n...He's just talking to himself.Edgeworth:\nShh! Be quiet and listen!Butz:\nI knew it... I shouldn't have done that! I blew it again...Edgeworth:\n(\"Done that\"? What did he do, I wonder...)Gumshoe:\nHey! You! About what you just said... I got an objection!Butz:\nWh-Wh-Wh-What the...!? Ed-Edgey! You dirty rat!Edgeworth:\n*glare* (Gumshoe... You oaf...!)Gumshoe:\nI-I'm sorry, sir! Before I knew it, I was shouting out, \"Objection!\". And in a loud, commanding voice, too! I even pointed with my pointer finger!Edgeworth:\n...You've watched too many trials.Gumshoe:\nI'm sorry!Edgeworth:\nOK, Larry, the jig is up. What have you got to say for yourself?Butz:\nUngh...Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEagle River\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThis is the Eagle River, sir. It runs pretty fast, so it doesn't ice over, even in the winter.\nEdgeworth:\nIf it had iced over, Wright would have been in some serious trouble.\nGumshoe:\nYou're right about that! He would've landed on the ice, and slid downstream to who knows where.\nEdgeworth:\n(...Not exactly what I meant, but alright...)\n\n\n\n\nDusky Bridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt's a little far, but I have a pretty clear view of Dusky Bridge from here.\nButz:\nAhh. I still can't believe it! ...Really.\nEdgeworth:\n...? What is it, Larry?\nButz:\nHuh! Err, uhh, nothing. It's nothing!\nGumshoe:\nSounds pretty suspicious to me!\nEdgeworth:\n(Something about that statement smells... And you know what they say...)\n\n\n\n\nStairway\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThese go all the way to Dusky Bridge. It's a pretty long, but easy, walk.\nGumshoe:\nI fell down 4 times on my way down here, sir!\nButz:\nOh, sorry about that, Detective. I ate four bananas and tossed their peels on the stairs on my way down here...\nGumshoe:\n... What!? So that's what I was slipping on!\nButz:\nBe careful on the way back. Those deadly banana peels are still out there.\nGumshoe:\nHmm... That's a real important piece of information right there, Mr. Edgeworth!\n\n\n\n\nString of flags\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this festive-looking ornament?\nButz:\nIt reminds me of art class in grade school. We used to have a lot of fun decorating the classroom with origami. Remember?\nEdgeworth:\nW-Well, I...\nButz:\nOh, yeah... You were never any good at it.\nGumshoe:\nReally?\nButz:\nYeah, this guy was so bad, he couldn't even fold a dollar, let alone a crane. Everyone tried to comfort him, but he would just sit there sobbing.\nGumshoe:\nReally? I never would have expected that.\nEdgeworth:\nBe quiet already! I'll never forget the shame of that day! You want a crane! I can now make a perfect quarter-inch crane without a single flaw!\nButz:\n... You know, Edgey... Nothing for nothing, but a quarter-inch crane without a single flaw is not easy.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's quite a feat, Prosecutor Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\n(Grr... This is exactly why I hate childhood friends...)\n\n\n\n\nShack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThat's a horrible graffiti problem you've got there, pal.\nButz:\nYou don't know anything, Detective. This is art! It's an expression of my bittersweet love for Iris.\nEdgeworth:\nLarry. Do you know what the difference between graffiti and true art is?\nButz:\n... It's how the artist himself defines it, right?\nEdgeworth:\n... (I should've seen that one coming.)\nGumshoe:\nWell, if that's the case, then all of my lunchboxes are masterpieces too, pal!\n\n\n\n\nRoof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe straw roof is totally covered with freshly fallen powdery snow.\nGumshoe:\nWow, makes a nice image, doesn't it? I always did like the rustic look.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Heavenly Hall\"... I suppose it's an appropriate name in some sense.\nButz:\nYou got that right. Look at that bridge up there. This place has to be heaven, because that thing is hell.\nEdgeworth:\n... You would do well to remember, Larry... ...that this is a sacred place to some people.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeavenly Hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this little shack anyway?\nButz:\nWell, I just discovered it myself yesterday.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd why were you down here in the first place?\nButz:\nErr, come on... I'm an artist... I was looking for a good place to sketch. This is a great little place! It's err... artistic. It's quiet, it's cold, it's got no power, and it looks like it's about to collapse.\nGumshoe:\n...Sounds a lot like my apartment there, pal.\nEdgeworth:\n(One thing's for sure... No one is likely to show up and disturb you here...)\nButz:\nSo can I get you something to drink? Some hot water, maybe?\nGumshoe:\n...He's getting all buddy-buddy on us, sir.\n\n\n\n\nIris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\n...Listen to me, Edgey. You've gotta do this... You've gotta save Iris!\nEdgeworth:\nWhy are you so sure she's innocent? Because she's cute?\nButz:\nWatch your mouth! Anyway, I've made up my mind about it! I'm going to marry that girl!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nGumshoe:\nUmm... Mr. Edgeworth is pretending he didn't hear you, so I'm gonna ask for him. Have you already asked this girl to marry you?\nButz:\nNo, no. Not yet. But I can tell how she feels by the look in her eyes! She's got this \"I really want this man to carry me over the threshold\" look! I'm sure Nick would be surprised! He'd never imagine that I could marry such a beautiful girl like that!\nEdgeworth:\nSomething tells me he would be shocked, indeed.\nButz:\nThat's why I didn't want her to do anything dangerous. I mean, what am I gonna do if she gets hurt?\nGumshoe:\n... What is this guy trying to say? He lost me about a mile back...\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... If we really want to know the answer to that... (...we're going to have to drag him onto the witness stand.)\n\n\n\n\nThe night of the crime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nCome to think of it, you still haven't answered my question. Where were you and what were you doing last night?\nButz:\nAww, man... Don't you have anything else to talk about? With that kind of attitude, you'll never be a ladies' man like me...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nButz:\nO-OK, OK! Chill out with those scary eyes! I got it! If you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Something incredible\"?\n\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n\nButz:\n...Yeah, yeah. But let's not talk about that now. Let's talk about the good old days. What do you say? Come on, I'll pour you a nice cup of hot water.\nEdgeworth:\n(Why hasn't he realized... ...that I absolutely despise talking about the \"good old days\", especially with him?)\n\n\n\n\nThe night of the crime (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat exactly did you see last night?\nButz:\nWell... It's kinda hard to say...\n\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n\nButz:\nIt's one of those things... Ya know what I mean...? It's like... It's not so much \"what\" I saw, as it's the situation in general... You see what I'm getting at? Whew, that's a relief. Thanks, buddy. Ha ha ha ha ha.\nEdgeworth:\n(I have the strangest urge to smash this guy against those big, nasty locks...)\n\n\n\n\nThe night of the crime (after breaking Psyche-Locks)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo you were here in Heavenly Hall last night, were you not, Larry? And you saw the lightning hit Dusky Bridge, didn't you?\nButz:\nS-Sorry, Edgey...\nGumshoe:\nSorry doesn't cut it, you scumbag! Threatening a young lady like that...\nButz:\n*gulp*... ... Wait, hold up.\nGumshoe:\n...What now, pal?\nButz:\nWhat are you talking about!? What \"threatening\" stuff!?\nGumshoe:\nI'll tell you what! You tried to scare Iris by threatening to expose her secret, pal!\nButz:\nWhat do you mean threaten!? When did I threaten her!?\nGumshoe:\n\"...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed...\" That sure sounds like a threat to me, pal! Blackmail, in fact!\nButz:\nGimme a break! It's a love letter! Haven't you ever been in love!?\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What did you just say!?\nButz:\nMy love for her burns so hotly, it could melt all the snow on this mountain!\nEdgeworth:\nO-Oh? Then what is this secret you mention!?\nButz:\nCome on, Edgey... Don't you get it? I'm talking about the secret love between her and me! Obviously she wouldn't want old lady Bikini to know about it, right...? About our... hot and sour... bittersweet love affair!\nEdgeworth:\n... Alright, then why did you send a love letter in a business-like manila envelope!?\nButz:\nGive me a break! It's not my fault I didn't have any other envelopes! Yeesh!\nGumshoe:\nThen why were you so quick to apologize, pal!?\nButz:\nIt's cuz Edgey gave me that scary look of his!\nEdgeworth:\n... ...\nButz:\nWhat's wrong, Edgey? Why are you so quiet all of a sudden?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's it? THAT'S what all those huge locks were about? (Changed from [That's it? That's all [sic] those huge locks were about?] in the original release) I-I don't understand why you were so defensive...\nButz:\nWell, I dunno either... I guess the thing is... ...you shouldn't expect too much from a guy like me. ...Hey, come on. Don't let it get you down!\nGumshoe:\n... B-But Mr. Edgeworth! This guy is still hiding something! I know it!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nDon't forget what this guy said just a minute ago!\n\n\nButz:\nIf you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible.\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm... He's right!) Larry!\nButz:\nWh-What!? Y-You're looking at me like a hungry dog that just found a bone!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat was this \"something incredible\" you saw last night...? ...You're going to tell me, Larry! One way or another!\n\n\n\n\nSomething incredible (appears after \"The night of the crime\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"I... I already told you, didn't I?\"Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagatama (after clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\n\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n-- The Night of the Crime --\nEdgeworth:\nAlright, now you're going to tell me what you really saw last night...\nButz:\nWhoa. You're really upset, aren't you, Edgey? OK, I'll talk!\nEdgeworth:\n...Huh? (That was a bit too easy...)\nButz:\nYeah, anyway! It was awesome! Never seen anything like it! At around 10 o'clock last night, it started thundering. I'd been sleeping... I'm not sure for how long. Suddenly... ZING! The world in front of me went white! Like I'd just been slapped in the face by my old girlfriend, Naomi!\nEdgeworth:\n...And then?\nButz:\nAnd then... It was on fire! The bridge was on fire!\nEdgeworth:\nDusky Bridge caught on fire!? Are you saying you saw it with your own eyes?\nButz:\nHey! Why are you giving me the evil eye!? I'm telling the truth!\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm... There are still three Psycholocks remaining... (Changed from [Hmm... There are still 3 Psycholocks remaining...] in the original release) That means he's still trying to hide something...) By the way, Larry... Where were you when you saw that happen?\nButz:\nWh-Wh-Wh-Where you say? Wh-Wh-What do you mean!?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean, \"What do I mean\"!? ...Just answer the question!\nButz:\nI-I was in my own room... by the Main Hall! Where else would I be!?\nEdgeworth:\nAs usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar. The problem, I suspect, lies there...\nButz:\nTh-Th-Th-Th-There? Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Whaddya mean th-th-there?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's impossible for you to have seen lightning strike Dusky Bridge from your room!\n\n\n\nPresent Hazakura Temple Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This is a map of the area.

Try drinking your hot water. If you don't drink it fast it's going to get cold.\nEdgeworth:\nOh, sorry... (It's cold alright... The water... And my evidence.)\nButz:\nWell? Have you calmed down yet?\nEdgeworth:\nUm, yes... I'm going to think it over again.\nButz:\nH-Hey, I'm telling you... there's nothing to think over! I was in my room doing \"she loves me, she loves me not\" with a bunch of flowers.\nLeads back to:\n\"As usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar.\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis is a map of the area. Take a look around the vicinity of Hazakura Temple.\nButz:\nWh-What am I looking for?\nEdgeworth:\nI think that should be fairly obvious. The Main Hall is surrounded by trees and it's impossible to see the bridge from here.\nButz:\nWhat...!? Why didn't you tell me that before!?\n\n1 LOCK BROKEN\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Well? How about it?\nButz:\nHow about what?\nEdgeworth:\nDo you feel like talking now?\nButz:\nAbout what?\nEdgeworth:\n... (It looks like it won't be that easy after all...) ...You leave me no choice. I'll have to move on to the next step. You weren't in your room at the temple. So then... Where were you?\nButz:\nY-Y-You don't know that I wasn't in my room!\nEdgeworth:\n(So where was Larry, and why was he there...? If I've read the situation up to this point correctly, the answer is fairly obvious.) ...Very well then. Let's test my theory. The place you witnessed lightning striking Dusky Bridge from was... here!\n\n\n\nPresent Heavenly Hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall!\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis is where you were! Well, what do you think, Larry!?\nButz:\nOh... Not much I guess.\nEdgeworth:\n... I'm sorry, but what kind of answer is that?\nButz:\nWell, you were just making small talk, right? Like \"How are you doing?\" or something.\nEdgeworth:\n...Larry. Look at the expression on my face. Do I look like I was just making small talk?\nButz:\nTo be honest? No... I guess not. Ha ha ha ha ha...\nEdgeworth:\n(It appears I didn't think it through carefully enough.)\nLeads back to:\n\"So where was Larry, and why was he there...?\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall!\nButz:\n...Wh-Why would I be hanging out in this old shack? It's freezing cold, there's no electricity, and it could fall apart at any minute...\nEdgeworth:\nLarry... How do you know that anyway? How do you know there's no electricity? After all, it's not that dark yet.\nButz:\nAh... Uh-oh!\nEdgeworth:\nIn other words, you have just provided evidence to prove my theory... My theory that you've at least once in your life visited Heavenly Hall after sunset!\n\n1 LOCK BROKEN\n\nButz:\nI have to admit I'm impressed, Edgey! You're in a totally different league from Nick.\nEdgeworth:\n...That's nice. Now tell me. What were you doing at this cold little shack last night?\nButz:\nThat's what you might call... A \"Fair de Core\".\nEdgeworth:\nI think you mean \"affaire de coeur\". Could it be you were... waiting for someone?\nButz:\nOoooh nooo! Y-You really are one scary guy, you know...\nEdgeworth:\nI believe that last night, you were waiting for this person to come meet you!\n\n\n\nPresent Iris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n \nEdgeworth:\n...Well, Larry!? Was it THIS person...?\nButz:\n...You know what? You should save your finger pointing for the courtroom.\nEdgeworth:\nTsk...!\nButz:\nIt's no wonder people call you a workaholic. You work too hard! You should be like me!\nEdgeworth:\n(Well, I'd rather \"work too hard\" than \"hardly work\" like a loafaholic like you...) In any case... I know you were waiting for someone!\nButz:\nYeah, but... It's like I said. It's an \"affaire de guerre\".\nEdgeworth:\nNo, Larry. You mean \"affaire de coeur\". At least I think you do.\nLeads back to:\n\"Could it be you were... waiting for someone?\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry.\nButz:\nI told you before... Don't call me \"Larry\"...\nEdgeworth:\nThe person you were waiting for was... Iris!\nButz:\nOhh... Suddenly I feel cold all over, Edgey.\nEdgeworth:\nNo doubt because of my chilly glare.\nButz:\nSo you think I got the hots for Sister Iris, huh...? D-Do you have some kind of evidence!? You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing?\nEdgeworth:\n(This is where I draw the line and end this ridiculous little game...)

I-Is it just me?\nEdgeworth:\nNow, I'm the one that suddenly feels cold...\nButz:\nMaybe it's because of my cold laugh?\nEdgeworth:\n(Grr... I hate making such stupid mistakes...)\nButz:\nDo you really have the evidence you say you do, Edgey?\nLeads back to:\n\"You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing?\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Here's your evidence. You called her to this spot with a pathetic blackmail letter!\nButz:\nOh! H-Hey! G-G-Give that back! You're embarrassing me! What are you doing with that anyway!?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's not important! ...I misjudged you, Larry.\nButz:\nWhat do you mean...?\nEdgeworth:\nTaking advantage of a woman's frailty like that! You should be ashamed of yourself!\nButz:\nOhhh... OHHHH!\nEdgeworth:\nFirst of all, what's this at the top of the letter? It says, \"Salutation here\"!\nButz:\nW-Well that's what it said in that book, \"Letter Writing for Dummies\"!\nEdgeworth:\nYou're not supposed to actually write that!

People acting bizarrely in my court! Uwa-hah!von Karma:\n...The stage is set. Now continue with the proceedings, Your Honor.Judge:\nVery well. Ms. von Karma, please give an outline of this case. With as little whipping as possible!von Karma:\nThe murder victim is the famed picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Her body was found in the Hazakura Temple courtyard. She had been stabbed through the torso by a ceremonial sword from a golden statue.Judge:\nThe sword in this picture... is the weapon in question, correct...? ...Very well. The court accepts this photo of the crime scene.Crime Photo added to the Court Record.von Karma:\nThere is no mistake. This was the doing of Sister Iris. After all... there is a witness to her crime.Judge:\n...Very well. Please bring this witness to the stand!Edgeworth:\n(And so it begins... My first and my last trial... as a defense attorney!)von Karma:\n...Witness. State your name and occupation. Please.Judge:\nH-Hold on here! I'm not sure about being not sure if I care for this at all! Witness! Please stand up nice and straight!Edgeworth:\nIf I recall correctly... ...there are a few milk crates in the Defendant's Lobby for our back pain-plagued witness. (Changed from [...there are a few milk crates in the defendant's lobby for witnesses with bad backs.] in the original release)Judge:\nBailiff! Fetch a crate for this poor lady, please!von Karma:\n...Once again. Your name and occupation, please.Bikini:\nLittle old me? Well, I'm the head nun of Hazakura Temple on Eagle Mountain. My name is Bikini. You got it? Bikini. Nice to meet everyone.Judge:\n... But you don't appear to be wearing a bikini right now... Uwah!von Karma:\n...The courtroom is the garden of holy judgment. Those with lechery in their hearts should leave this sanctuary at once!Judge:\nY-You want me to leave!?Bikini:\nNo need to get your bikinis in a twist! Let me tell you, I'm a sight to behold in summer! Wha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha!Edgeworth:\nIn any case... Witness. I hear that you saw the crime take place on the night in question.Bikini:\nThat's right! I can still hardly believe it myself, to be honest. There's no way dear little Iris could do anything like that...Judge:\nLet us hear what you have to say then. First, tell us aboot your own movements that night, eh!Witness Testimony-- The Night of the Murder --Bikini:\nThat night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But...\nWell, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently.\nSo, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.\nThere's no bath at the Inner Temple, you see, and I needed a long, hot soak.\nIt was after I had finished, just as I was heading back... that's when I saw it!Judge:\nHmm... So it was simply coincidence that you found yourself returning to Hazakura Temple?Bikini:\n...Yes, you could say that. If my back hadn't been in so much pain, I would have stayed at the Inner Temple.Edgeworth:\n(That sounds like a pretty important statement she just made...)von Karma:\nThere is only one problem with this testimony that I can see... And you're not about to fall at the first hurdle, now are you, Miles Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth. ...Please begin your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- The Night of the Murder --Bikini:\nThat night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this Inner Temple...?\nBikini:\nWell, see, conversing with the spirits is what we train people to do, right?\nJudge:\nWe'll be the ones asking you the questions, madam.\nBikini:\n...In order to do that, a place strong in spiritual power is required. There's a small temple across Dusky Bridge, called the Inner Temple.  Acolytes must spend an entire night there to undergo intense training.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd how exactly do you help with this process...?\nBikini:\nIt is all quite exacting. It can't be performed without a nun supervising.\nvon Karma:\nLike a tutor, watching to make sure a spoiled child studies.\nEdgeworth:\n(A tutor with a whip, in your case.) If that is the case... ...then why did you return to Hazakura Temple, where the murder took place?Bikini:\nWell, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nViolently...?\nBikini:\nThat's right. It's no laughing matter, especially in winter! I can't hold anything heavier than a knife and fork during the cold months! Just being alive is like strict training! Wah ha ha! Wha ha! Wah ha ha!\nEdgeworth:\nOn the night of the murder, was this fabulous back of yours hurting again...?\nBikini:\nThat's right. Raging like a bull in a pigpen. I almost fainted once or twice! I just knew that unless I warmed it up, it was going to finally finish me off!Bikini:\nSo, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou \"left Iris to help\"... With what?\nBikini:\nWhat do you think? The acolyte's training, of course. It was just past 10 PM, so we were starting to enter into the training exercises proper.\nJudge:\nWasn't it your place to remain with the disciple?\nBikini:\nWell, the job is simply to watch over the acolyte so that they don't pass away.\nEdgeworth:\nJust to confirm this point again, that night... ...you met Iris in the Inner Temple, correct?\nBikini:\nYes, yes. She's a gentle, honest girl. She's never once failed to follow my directions.Present Iris's Testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Witnesses have to undergo their own trials, I'm afraid. The defendant's fate rests on their powers of observation and memory, after all.\nBikini:\nWell, well, well. Don't worry! I'm more than up to the task! I'm a woman of faith, after all. The head honcho of Hazakura Temple.\nEdgeworth:\nIn that case, Ms. Honcho... I'd like you to explain something for me. The discrepancy between your testimony and that of the defendant, Iris. She claims that after ringing the lights out bell, she went back and stayed in her room. ...Which means! She did not go to the Inner Temple at all!\nBikini:\nN... No...! She said that...?\nvon Karma:\n\nvon Karma:\nA defendant or a witness... Who is more likely to lie, do you suppose? The defendant is simply lying to cover her back!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nBut that is completely illogical. The murder was committed in the courtyard of Hazakura Temple. Claiming that she \"went to the Inner Temple\" would make for a much better alibi.\nvon Karma:\n...!\nBikini:\nBut that is odd... Whatever the reason... I can't believe that she would lie...!\nJudge:\nHmm... she does indeed have honest eyes! Uwaaaah!\nvon Karma:\n...All people lie. That is my belief.\nJudge:\nWhy am I the only one being whipped in here...!? Anyway! Neither the witness nor the defendant have any reason to lie! Which means... We must call your memory into question...\nBikini:\nDear, dear, dear. You're older than me and yet you want to play that game, do you?\nJudge:\nA-Ah, well, that isn't exactly what I...\nBikini:\nMy memory is perfect! Crystal clear! Especially in winter!\nJudge:\nThen... I suppose it's too early to end this cross-examination, eh. Mr. Edgeworth. If you are going to question the memory of this witness... ...you will need to show me a more decisive piece of evidence.\nEdgeworth:\n...Understood, Your Honor. (I was naïve to think that alone would do the trick.)\nJudge:\nThen please add your comments aboot Iris to the testimony... And let us return to the cross-examination.\nChanges statement from \"So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.\" to \"Iris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner.\"Bikini:\nIris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nAre you sure that you're not making a mistake...?\nBikini:\n...You, young man, need to get your estimation of me up from the floor!\nEdgeworth:\nNngh...!\nBikini:\nIris always wears the same clothes. The smallest thing out of place would have stood out like a sore thumb to me! You're making a mistake, thinking I made a mistake!\nJudge:\n...An excellent finish there, witness.\nEdgeworth:\n(Still, I have to wonder...)Present Iris's Hood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...Witness. Let's get one thing straight.\"Bikini:\nThere's no bath at the Inner Temple, you see, and I needed a long, hot soak.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...So you returned to the Hazakura Temple in order to take a bath?\nBikini:\nMy back is to blame for everything. It's a \"do or be done in\" kind of world, after all.\nEdgeworth:\nHow long were you in the bath for, if you don't mind me asking?\nBikini:\n... My my my, what a filthy little rogue you are! I know what's on your mind!\nEdgeworth:\n...?\nBikini:\nI bet your next question is going to be, \"Where exactly did you wash?\" Ah, THIS is why you have to watch the young ones...\nEdgeworth:\nW-What are you going on about!? I was... Gwah!\nvon Karma:\n...Pathetic, Miles Edgeworth.\nJudge:\nThe lowest of the low.\nEdgeworth:\n(Is there some sort of \"Kick Me\" sign stuck to the defense's bench!?)\nBikini:\nAnyway, I couldn't afford to be away from my post for too long, you understand, so...Bikini:\nIt was after I had finished, just as I was heading back... that's when I saw it!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe crime took place in the courtyard, correct...?\nBikini:\nWhen you go from my room to the Main Hall... ...you have to take a winding hallway from which you can see the courtyard.\nvon Karma:\nThat's right. In other words... ...it was pure coincidence that the witness saw the crime taking place before her eyes. There was no complicated set-up in this case!\nJudge:\nHmm... That certainly seems to be true.Edgeworth:\n(There is indeed only one problem with this testimony. If I can clearly point out what it is, then I can begin to quantify... ...just how good this witness's memory and observation skills are.)Edgeworth:\n...Witness. Let's get one thing straight. The defendant whom you claim to have met... ...she was wearing this \"Demon-Warding Hood\", correct?Bikini:\nOf course! That is a very important piece of clothing, I'll have you know! Wha ha ha! Wha ha ha! Ha ha... Wait a minute...von Karma:von Karma:\nH-Hold it right there! Why do you have that...!?Edgeworth:\nThat's the question of the day, now isn't it... Ms. von Karma? I'll have you know that this hood was given to someone as a gift that night. Before the lights out bell was rung.von Karma:\nW... What!?Edgeworth:\n...You know where I'm going with this, don't you? If the witness had seen the defendant as she claims... ...then the Iris she saw should have been missing this very hood! (Changed from [...the defendant couldn't have been wearing this very hood!] in the original release)Bikini:\nWell well well!Edgeworth:\n(It's not a bad feeling at all, exposing contradictions like this... Now I understand that happy look on Wright's face every time he does it...)Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Witness, your response... Wuahaaa!von Karma:\n...Sister. This hood... You have spare ones around the temple, don't you?Bikini:\nSpares... Well... I do tend to make too many of them.Judge:\nI see... A stockpile. A surplus of hoods, eh?Bikini:\nEach nun is only given one hood. This should be the only hood that Iris owned...Judge:\nHmm... Then this is quite strange! Waaaah!von Karma:\nIf there was a surplus of hoods, then she could have worn one of those! ...There is no contradiction here!Judge:\nHmm...Edgeworth:\n(I'm sorry to break this to you, Ms. von Karma... but you won't get away that easily. Discrepancies such as this will sow seeds in any human heart. The seeds of doubt.)Judge:\n...Witness. While I don't wish to call your testimony into doubt... ...you must give every detail with precision.Bikini:\nI-I'm not sure I'm comfortable going along with this...von Karma:\nSister. You shall continue with your testimony. Tell us what you saw after finishing your bath, on your way back to the Inner Temple!Edgeworth:\n(Those seeds of doubt are sprouting in the judge's heart. They just need a little more stimulation to bear fruit... Contradictory stimulation.)Witness Testimony-- After My Bath --Bikini:\nI finished my bath around 11, and I thought I should return to the Inner Temple.\nAnd as I was walking back... I heard a noise from the courtyard. I took a look and...\nIris was...! Oh, Mystic Elise! And with that sword, of all things!\nMystic Elise was staying in the corner room, which faces out onto the courtyard.\nThe stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window.Judge:\nYou saw a truly terrible sight, didn't you...? If I was in your place... ...then it would be much like Ms. von Karma whipping Mr. Edgeworth in two in court! And me, seeing it all from this very chair! ...Er, well, something like that.Edgeworth:\n(This judge... His imagination is about as vivid and creative as Detective Gumshoe...)von Karma:\nI would look the fool if I commented on such foolishness. Anyway, this case is mine... Miles Edgeworth!Edgeworth:\nCalling everyone by their full name... Can't you do something about that habit of yours?Cross Examination-- After My Bath --Bikini:\nI finished my bath around 11, and I thought I should return to the Inner Temple.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...How far is it from your room to the Inner Temple?\nBikini:\nLet me think a moment... About twenty minutes, on these stumps of mine. It's about 15 minutes to Dusky Bridge from Hazakura Temple. The Inner Temple is just beyond the bridge.\nvon Karma:\nStill, you never made it back there that night, did you?\nBikini:\nT-That's right... I was heading along the walkway toward the Main Hall...Bikini:\nAnd as I was walking back... I heard a noise from the courtyard. I took a look and...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou say you heard a noise...?\nBikini:\n\"Thump\"... Just like that.\nvon Karma:\n...That could only be the sound of the victim falling.\nBikini:\nIt's very quiet in the temple, you know. You can even hear the snow falling from the branches. \"Thump\"... Just like that.\nJudge:\nBut then, couldn't this noise you heard have been snow falling to the ground?\nBikini:\n... I never thought of that. Wah ha ha. Wha ha ha. Ha ha...\nJudge:\nHoh hoh. Hoh hoh. Hoh hoh... Uaaaaaah!\nvon Karma:\nThe next one to laugh gets a whipping!\nBikini:\nWell. Whatever the source of the sound, I looked over at the courtyard and...Bikini:\nIris was...! Oh, Mystic Elise! And with that sword, of all things!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...This is the second time that the witness has testified to seeing the defendant. But... some doubt remains in these claims.\nBikini:\nHey, just what does that mean!? Just because you're a good-looking young man doesn't give you the right to...\nEdgeworth:\nThe murderer who stabbed the victim with the sword... Sister Bikini, try to recall exactly who it was you saw! As clearly as you can!\nBikini:\nHmm... Well. You're a handsome young man, so I'll forgive you. ... Oh! Now that you mention it... There was something awfully strange about her... Something that has been bugging me all this time!\nEdgeworth:\n...Please, don't keep us in suspense.\nBikini:\nHer hood!\nvon Karma:\nHer hood...?\nBikini:\nThat's right! ...It's coming back to me... Iris... She wasn't wearing her hood! I thought something was out of place, but... It all makes sense now, doesn't it? After all, she'd given that hood away to someone, right?\nEdgeworth:\n...Urk!\nvon Karma:\nHah... You've dug your own grave, Miles Edgeworth!\nJudge:\nWhat do you say, Mr. Edgeworth? Is this testimony important?\n\n\n\nIt's not important\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(...This line of questioning is only going to tear the  wound open further.) These statements are as useless as the investigations of a certain detective. ...There is no need to record them.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nJudge:\nVery well. ...Please, continue with your testimony.\nvon Karma:\nHmph...\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nIt's important\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(This may initially appear to put me at a disadvantage... But, I can't see any other leads at the moment...) ...Your Honor. I would like these new statements to be added to the testimony.\nvon Karma:\nHeh... Miles Edgeworth.\nvon Karma:\nIf you want to hang yourself, you need only to ask. I'll gladly lend you my whip!\nJudge:\nWitness. Add that statement to your testimony.\nBikini:\n...No problem.\nAdds statement \"Now that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on.\"Bikini:\nNow that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou are sure about that...?\nBikini:\nYes. After all, we always wear the same clothes. Ah! I don't mean because we're poor, you understand? It's our style. Yes, that's it!\nEdgeworth:\n...There's absolutely no need to explain yourself.\nBikini:\nAnyway! She looked different from normal, so that really stuck out.\nvon Karma:\nLike me holding a whippet puppy instead of my whip.\nEdgeworth:\n(At least then it might bite you and not someone else...)\nBikini:\nIris didn't have her hood on. I'm sure of it!\nJudge:\n...Very well. Now, please tell us aboot the victim, eh.Bikini:\nMystic Elise was staying in the corner room, which faces out onto the courtyard.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe room the victim was staying in overlooked the courtyard, correct?\nJudge:\nWhich means... the victim's room was on the second floor?\nBikini:\nNo, no. Hazakura Temple is a single story building. But the mountain itself slopes downward... ...which elevates the Main Gate side of the temple and the guest rooms in the back... ...to about the height of a two story building.\nJudge:\nI see... And the victim was staying in one of these elevated rooms, correct?\nBikini:\nYes... I should know. I'm the one who carried her things to her room, after all...Bikini:\nThe stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat makes you so sure of all this...?\nBikini:\nIt's just like I told you earlier... \"I heard a noise from the courtyard.\" OK? \"Thump\"... Just like that.\nvon Karma:\nYou're one smart sister, I'll give you that. The autopsy report states that... ...the victim's body was covered in bruises... ...indicating a fall from around 10 feet in height.\nJudge:\nHmm... It appears that the witness was not mistaken then.\nBikini:\nYep. Yep. I'm more than just a pretty face. Especially in winter! I'm a woman of faith, after all. The head honcho of Hazakura Temple.\nEdgeworth:\n(There's only two of them working there...!)\nvon Karma:\nWhat's wrong, Miles Edgeworth? No snappy comeback remark?\nEdgeworth:\n...Present Elise's Autopsy Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...Impressive logic. That's what I'd like to say, anyway.\"Edgeworth:\n(...It doesn't feel like she is lying. This is very powerful testimony, too. She claims to have seen the instant in which the defendant stabbed the victim... There are only two things I can believe in right now... My client, Iris, and my own abilities as a defense attorney.)Edgeworth:\n...Impressive logic. That's what I'd like to say, anyway.Bikini:\nOh please, do! My brain is something else... especially in winter!Edgeworth:\nHowever... I think you are overlooking one thing. ...Ms. von Karma. Would you be so kind as to take another look at the autopsy report?von Karma:\nT-The autopsy report...?Edgeworth:\nThe victim did fall from a height of 10 feet. ...However. This fall... was after she was killed.von Karma:\nAh...!Judge:\nT-That's right! It says \"after death\" right here!Edgeworth:\nThe scene the witness claims to have seen is contradictory! If the defendant stabbed and killed the victim there in the courtyard... ...how did the victim then go on to take a ten foot fall!?von Karma:\nAaah!Judge:\nO-Order! Order! The victim was killed and then fell! If that is the case... ...then the victim must have been killed in her room... Don't you agree?von Karma:\nTh-That is the logical conclusion... Yes, that's right! The victim must have been stabbed by the defendant in her own room! And she was then thrown out of her window down into the courtyard below!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nWere there any signs of a struggle in Ms. Deauxnim's room...?von Karma:\n...!Edgeworth:\nShe was stabbed with a sword! That would leave a blood stain, wouldn't you agree?Judge:\nW-Well, Ms. von Karma? Was there any blood...? Waaaaaah!von Karma:\n...No traces of blood were found in the victim's room.Judge:\n...Your whip has just caused traces of blood to be found on my glorious playoff beard. However! If there was no blood in the room, then your claim that... Waaaaah!von Karma:\nI'm sure there's no need for me to go over this... ...as I'm sure Your Honor is well aware... ...of when a stab wound produces the most blood.Judge:\nWhen it produces the most blood...?von Karma:\nVery little blood is actually lost at the moment of a blade's insertion. If you want to talk about when the most blood would be lost from a body... ...that would be when the blade is removed.Edgeworth:\nIndeed. With the weapon still in place... ...it acts like a lid on the wound.Judge:\nThat's true... With the weapon still in the body, there wouldn't be much bleeding... A perfectly reasonable line of thinking!von Karma:\nWe have come to a conclusion then! The victim was thrown out of the window with the sword still in place... This removes all of the contradictions!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! I must admit that this is a probable version of events!Edgeworth:\n(I'd expect no less from Franziska von Karma... She locates and takes control of every vital point!)von Karma:\n...Hmph...Judge:\nIt seems... ...that we need a clearer testimony from the witness. Remove all supposition on your part and tell us only the truth, please! Witness! Please! Remain standing on the crate!Bikini:\nDon't go selling me short now! The weight of winter snow has bent me out of shape! ...Especially my back and my mood!von Karma:\nSister. Please, give us your testimony. I will give you a vigorous massage once we are finished here.Edgeworth:\n(...With the whip?)Bikini:\n...Oh, boy. Alright, alright...Witness Testimony-- Further Details --Bikini:\nWhen I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place.\nThinking about it now, I didn't actually see her stab Mystic Elise.\nI've never seen so much blood before...\nThat's when I fainted. You can't blame me, can you?\nAnd when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back!Judge:\nHmm... This all confirms Ms. von Karma's theory...von Karma:\nVon Karmas strive for nothing but perfection. Putting together such facts is nothing for me! You should know that, Miles Edgeworth!Edgeworth:\n(\"Perfection\" is an impossibility, Franziska von Karma... And I'm here to teach you just that...)Cross Examination-- Further Details --Bikini:\nWhen I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nAt that time... was the victim bleeding?\nBikini:\nWell... I was very shocked to be seeing all this, of course... So I'm not entirely sure... But I don't think I saw any blood. Not then.\nvon Karma:\n...I'm sure that you didn't. The weapon was acting as a plug in the wound.\nEdgeworth:\nIn any case... Let's be clear on one very important point. Did you actually see the instant in which the victim was stabbed!?Bikini:\nThinking about it now, I didn't actually see her stab Mystic Elise.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Think carefully. This is very important.\nBikini:\nIt's Iris we are talking about here! I'm thinking for all I'm worth! ... No, when I looked over, the sword was already in Mystic Elise's body.\nJudge:\nHmmmmmm...\nEdgeworth:\n(It might not be  conclusive, but... ...this testimony supports her theory.)\nvon Karma:\nThe victim was stabbed in her room and then dropped into the courtyard... ...I think this proves it rather well, Miles Edgeworth.Bikini:\nI saw the instant in which the blade, plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n\"Smoothly\", you say... You're saying you saw the sword smoothly slide out?\nBikini:\nThat's right...\nBikini:\nThe whole thing happened right next to the gold statue of Mystic Ami. Mystic Elise was on the ground, and Iris was stooped over her. The sword was buried up to the hilt. When Iris stood up, the sword in her hand just slid out of Mystic Elise's body. It slid out from that gaping wound...! Aaaah...\nJudge:\nIt goes without saying... that if the sword was removed there would be bleeding.\nvon Karma:\n...Nothing out of place here.\nEdgeworth:\n(Is that really the case...? I can't help but feel that something about this testimony is very out of place... That something which couldn't possibly have happened... appears to have happened.)Present Shichishito\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Sister Bikini. You are a reliable witness...\"Bikini:\nI've never seen so much blood before...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...So you're saying that you saw the victim's blood?\nBikini:\nT-That's right! Some of it had splattered onto Iris, too...\nvon Karma:\nWhen the defendant was arrested, she was meditating in her room. And her blood-flecked clothing was neatly folded in the corner.\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What!? (Her clothes were blood-flecked as well...?)\nJudge:\nHmmm... That seems quite conclusive to me...\nEdgeworth:\n(What should I do...? Press this point further?)\n\n\n\nStop here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I can't afford to make things look any worse for the defendant. I'll bide my time for now.)\nJudge:\n...Witness. Please continue your testimony. From after you witnessed the victim bleeding!\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nGoing back to your previous statement... ...you said that you saw little bleeding when the victim was stabbed. But now... you say you saw the victim bleeding...?\nBikini:\nWell, well. I say that what I saw is what I saw.\nJudge:\nW-What did you see?\nBikini:\nMaybe I didn't see the poor woman get stabbed... But I saw the girl pull the sword out of her, plain as day.\nEdgeworth:\nPulling the sword out...?\nBikini:\nWell, it wasn't exactly pulling... It was more like it \"came out\".\nJudge:\nWitness! You will add this statement to your testimony!\nBikini:\nOh... Was that important...!?\nEdgeworth:\n(More important than you can imagine...)\nAdds statement \"I saw the instant in which the blade, plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out.\"Press (after adding statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWas the bleeding caused by the killer removing the sword...?\nBikini:\nNo mistaking it! I remember it all, clear as day!\nEdgeworth:\n...Don't you think that's a bit odd?\nvon Karma:\nWhat do you mean, Miles Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nWhy would the killer pull out the sword?\nvon Karma:\nWhat...?\nEdgeworth:\nIf all she wanted to do was place the weapon in the hand of the gold statue... ...then there was no reason to remove it from the body. All that would've accomplished is causing the victim to bleed unnecessarily. ...Your thoughts, Ms. von Karma?\nvon Karma:\nT-That's...\nJudge:\nIndeed... It is strange, now that you mention it.\nEdgeworth:\n(I'm going to need to find an answer to this mystery, too...)\nvon Karma:\nA-Anyway! The witness saw something terrible! ...So what did you do after that, witness?Bikini:\nThat's when I fainted. You can't blame me, can you?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nNow, on to what the killer did next... You saw none of it? Correct?\nBikini:\nWell... I was unconscious...\nvon Karma:\nHow long were you out for?\nBikini:\nI don't know... 10, maybe 20 minutes...? A young man with a very prickly looking head woke me up. ...By stepping on me, actually.\nJudge:\nHmm... I'm not sure I like that method of resuscitation!\nBikini:\nWell, I wasn't asking for mouth-to-mouth, or anything of the sort... ...but I would've welcomed a more gentle awakening right about then, let me tell you.\nEdgeworth:\n...I shall have words with the offender personally. What did you see upon awakening...?Bikini:\nAnd when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nBy \"Mystic Ami\", you are referring to the golden statue, correct?\nBikini:\nJust stabbing someone with the Shichishito, a sacred treasure, is terrible enough.\nBikini:\nBut to then make Mystic Ami hold the blade...!\nvon Karma:\nTruly, a heinous, despicable crime.\nEdgeworth:\nIt is easy to despise something. Anyone can do it. However, there is something that cannot be done so easily...\nvon Karma:\nWhatever it is, I'm sure it's doubly hard for you. Anyway, what is the problem?\nEdgeworth:\nExactly why would the killer set up this gruesome scene? Can anyone explain the reasoning behind that?\nvon Karma:\n...!\nJudge:\nHmmmmm... No, I don't think I can.\nvon Karma:\n... There isn't always a logical reason behind why someone acts!\nBikini:\nThat's true, so true. In early spring, for example, I often find myself...\nEdgeworth:\n(\"There isn't always\"... That phrase might come in handy someday.)Edgeworth:\n(There are too many unnatural elements in this case... Why was it necessary to use the Shichishito from the Ami statue as a weapon? Why was the weapon finally placed back in the hand of the statue? If I can expose the flaws in this testimony, perhaps then I will begin to find the truth.)Edgeworth:\nSister Bikini. You are a reliable witness... At least, I'd like to think so. But there are too many contradictions here.Bikini:\nW-What do you mean? You make it sound as though I'm a liar! But... You're a handsome young man, so I'll forgive you.von Karma:\nWhat contradictions are you talking about?Edgeworth:\nIn the scene that the witness claims to have seen... ...the weapon was thrust up to its hilt into the victim. Furthermore... the killer withdrew the weapon smoothly from the body. ...However! Both of these are complete impossibilities!Judge:\nWhat do you mean...? Please, explain you... Uwaaaaah!von Karma:\nExplain yourself!Edgeworth:\nTo start with... Do you think it would be possible to stab someone to the hilt with this? No matter how I look at the defendant, she doesn't appear strong enough for that.von Karma:von Karma:\n\"Doesn't appear\"...? What meaningless dribble! I, too, may appear to be weak and frail... But I can crush men under my heel and make them weep, should I so choose!Judge:\nThe objection stands! I wept a little back there, I must admit.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\n...That isn't the only issue here. If this sword was truly stabbed into the body up to the hilt... Well, just look at all the branches on it. It certainly wouldn't come out smoothly.von Karma:\nT-That's...Edgeworth:\nWe also have the problem of the amount of bleeding. It's true that when a blade is left in a body, it acts as a \"plug\" of sorts. However! When the weapon is shaped like this, it's an entirely different story. The wound would be too large for the blade to completely stop from bleeding!von Karma:von Karma:\nT-That's nothing more than conjecture! In reality, the victim was stabbed with the Shichishito. Even a weapon of this nature... ...may still sometimes slide out smoothly, and may still sometimes stop the blood loss!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nI'm not finished. There is still one more... conclusive contradiction.Judge:\nY-You've still got more!?Edgeworth:\n...This one is simple. If this sword really was thrust in all the way to the hilt... ...why is there only blood on the tip of it?von Karma:\nAh...!Edgeworth:\nIf this witness is telling the truth... Then there should be blood along the entire length of the sword!von Karma:\nNoooooo!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Ord-- Whaaaaaaaa!von Karma:\nBravo... Miles Edgeworth. Raising this many contradictions from a single piece of evidence! All the other attorneys I know could maybe manage one, if that!Judge:\nBut what does this all mean!? You have proven contradictions regarding the murder weapon, but...Edgeworth:\n...Having come this far, there can only be one answer.von Karma:\nAnd that is...?Edgeworth:\nThe weapon used to kill the victim... ...was not the Shichishito!Judge:\nW-Whaaaaaaaaat!?von Karma:\nA foolishly foolish idea born from the foolish mind of a foolhardy foolish fool.Edgeworth:\nLet's examine this again. What was it that made us think this sword was the murder weapon?Bikini:\nW-Well... It's because Mystic Ami was holding it...Edgeworth:\n...Exactly. However! If you reflect on this, that is the only basis we have to assume such a thing. The impression left by the scene was just too strong. That is what influenced us. It influenced us to believe that the Shichishito was the murder weapon!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! Waaaaaaaaah!von Karma:\nSo maybe the Shichishito was not the murder weapon. Even if that is the case... it changes nothing, Miles Edgeworth! The Sister here saw everything! She saw the defendant stab the victim with a sword-like object.Judge:\nHmmmmmm... That's true! Your response, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\n... If that is so... I would like the prosecution to answer the obvious question it raises.Judge:\nThe obvious... question?Edgeworth:\n...Yes. Namely... Where did the real murder weapon disappear to?von Karma:\n...!Edgeworth:\nIt goes without saying that the police searched the Main Hall and the surrounding area. ...Perhaps the prosecution can enlighten us as to if a \"sword-like object\" was found.von Karma:\nT-That's...Judge:\nAnswer the question, Ms. von Karma!von Karma:\n... No evidence of that kind was found.Judge:\nHmmmmm... Another mystery to throw onto the pile! A trial without a murder weapon is a tricky beast!Bikini:\nExcuse me... Could I say something...? I just remembered something, actually...von Karma:\n...What is it, Sister?Bikini:\nI was just thinking... It's possible... ...that just maybe... what actually happened was... it was just over there...Judge:\n... What exactly are you going on aboot here?Bikini:\nThe murder weapon, I mean! Maybe... I think I might know where the sword was disposed of!Edgeworth:\nYou what!?von Karma:\nWell then... I think we need to hear testimony from you one more time, Sister.Edgeworth:\n(Impossible...! What else... What else could this old woman have seen!?)Witness Testimony-- Location of the Weapon --Bikini:\nI saw the murder at around 11 PM...\nAnd after asking that it be reported, I went out to the Main Gate.\nAnd there... I saw tracks! Tracks that indicated the snowmobile had been used!\nIt takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, but less than 5 using one of those!\nMaybe they threw the weapon into Eagle River and came back while I was knocked out?\n...Iris could have done that. She can drive a snowmobile after all...Judge:\nHmmmmmm... Witness. Please, tell us everything you know right away next time.Bikini:\nWell. I'm not in the best of shape. What with my back and my age, you know.von Karma:\nQuite... There were indeed snowmobile tracks in front of the Main Gate. Here is a photograph.Judge:\nA snowmobile, eh... I see. Well, it certainly is an interesting theory...von Karma:\nThe tracks begin in front of Hazakura Temple... ...and run all the way to Dusky Bridge!Tracks Photo added to the Court Record.von Karma:\n...That solves your pesky little problem, yes? The Eagle River's current is quite swift, meaning that it doesn't freeze over in winter. Making it the perfect place to dispose of the murder weapon!Edgeworth:\n(Did she really go to the river to dispose of the murder weapon...?)Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth! ...Your cross-examination, please.Cross Examination-- Location of the Weapon --Bikini:\nI saw the murder at around 11 PM...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...You are sure about the time?\nBikini:\nYes... I was worried about it, after all.\nJudge:\nWhy was that?\nBikini:\nBecause I have a strong sense of responsibility. Especially at this time of year. The acolyte was being doused in freezing water at the time... I couldn't very well take it easy in the bath all night now, could I? So at 11, I decided to leave Hazakura Temple.\nEdgeworth:\n(Her estimation of the time seems reliable, at least.)\nvon Karma:\nPlease continue, Sister.Bikini:\nAnd after asking that it be reported, I went out to the Main Gate.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou asked Phoenix Wright to report the crime, correct?\nBikini:\nRight, right, the one who trampled me.\nEdgeworth:\n(It seems she is the type to hold a grudge...)\nBikini:\nThere isn't a phone in the Main Hall, so I sent him to the bridge.\nvon Karma:\nPhoenix Wright... He didn't even have his cell phone on him?\nEdgeworth:\nHe had forgotten it at home, apparently.\nvon Karma:\nWhat a naïve boy, as always! Not only do I always carry my phone, but I always have my whip in hand, too!\nBikini:\nAnyway, I was really scared... And it was taking him a while to get back... So I thought I'd go out by the Main Gate for a spell.Bikini:\nAnd there... I saw tracks! Tracks that indicated the snowmobile had been used!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nAs I recall, there was a snowmobile outside the Main Gate when I visited.\nBikini:\nThat's it. That's the only one we have. It'll run no matter how much snow falls!\nEdgeworth:\nNow, you're certain the snowmobile was there at the Main Gate when you arrived?\nBikini:\nYes, of course. It was parked in front of the gate.\nvon Karma:\nSo... she had already gone, discarded the murder weapon, and returned by that time.\nEdgeworth:\n(...I'm not sure if this is really relevant... What should I do...?)\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(...I need answers to every possible doubt.) The snowmobile in question... Was it still warm at that time?\nBikini:\nHuh? Huh? Huh? Huh? What do you mean? What do you mean?\nJudge:\nWhat do you mean, eh?\nvon Karma:\nWhat do you mean, Miles Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\n(...I'm playing to a slow crowd here.) It goes without saying that using a snowmobile will heat its engine. If it was still warm, then it means it was recently used.\nBikini:\nAh! I see! I never thought of that!\nJudge:\nHmmm, that's right! I overlooked that, too!\nvon Karma:\n...Of course you did.\nEdgeworth:\nThen answer the question please, witness.\nBikini:\n... I don't often go around touching hot engines...\nEdgeworth:\n...Hmm.\nBikini:\nHowever... Now that you mention it... There wasn't any snow on it.\nJudge:\nSnow...?\nBikini:\nYes. For some reason, only the snowmobile wasn't covered in snow...\nEdgeworth:\n(There wasn't any snow on it!? Curses!)\nJudge:\nIt seems highly likely that the killer did use the snowmobile then, eh!\nvon Karma:\nHow long does it take to get to Dusky Bridge by snowmobile?\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nStop here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(It looks very likely that the snowmobile is related to this case. I can't help but think that Iris used it... But for what...? I'd better hold off on this... for now.)\nJudge:\n...Well then, witness.\nJudge:\nHow long does it take to reach the bridge by snowmobile?\nLeads back to cross-examinationBikini:\nIt takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, but less than 5 using one of those!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nIn that case... why didn't you use it yourself? You could've spared yourself some walking.\nBikini:\nAh! There's a reason for that! Have we got a moment for me to explain?\nJudge:\nI think that's why the question was asked in the first place...\nBikini:\n...It was about a month ago. I was driving my beloved little snowmobile, happy as can be. I'd fetched some water and was heading back when I went and crashed into a tree! The tree and my back both went crunch. Just like that. Crunch.\nJudge:\nHmm... Crunch.\nBikini:\n...I haven't been able to find the courage to ride anything since then...\nBikini:\nAnyway, the killer must have used it!Bikini:\nMaybe they threw the weapon into Eagle River and came back while I was knocked out?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nRefresh our memory. How long were you knocked out for...?\nBikini:\nLike I said, somewhere between 10 to 20 minutes.\nvon Karma:\nIt's possible to get to the bridge and back in 10 minutes using the snowmobile...\nEdgeworth:\n...I have to concede that is more than enough time.\nvon Karma:\nIs that all you wish to concede, Miles Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n...Present Tracks Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I admit this photograph proves something.\"Bikini:\n...Iris could have done that. She can drive a snowmobile after all...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhile it would have been possible, time-wise... ...one element remains out of place here.\nJudge:\nOh? And what would this mystery element be?\nEdgeworth:\nThe killer's reasoning, Your Honor. \"Why did the killer do all of this?\" Why go to the Eagle River to dispose of the murder weapon when there are other methods?\nJudge:\nHmm... Too many unanswered questions! Your response, Ms. von Karma? Waaaaaaaah!\nvon Karma:\nTurning to me for help over the slightest thing! Why don't you think for yourself once in a while? ...Your Honor.\nJudge:\nWhaaaaat!?\nEdgeworth:\n(She's as over the top as always...)\nvon Karma:\nA-Anyway... Whatever the reason, the fact remains that the defendant could have done this! The murder weapon was disposed of in the river! Another point to me, Miles Edgeworth!Present Tracks Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I admit this photograph proves something.\"Edgeworth:\n(Another mystery to feed the fire... \"Was there any reason to go and throw away the murder weapon\"...? Luckily, there is surely a problem with this testimony. Now all I have to do is start poking holes in this flawed account...)Edgeworth:\nI admit this photograph proves something. It proves that the snowmobile was used on the night of the murder.von Karma:\nYou've finally accepted the inevitable, it seems... Miles Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\nHowever... If what the witness says is true, why is there only one set of tracks?von Karma:\nWhat do you mean...?Edgeworth:\nIris left Hazakura Temple, threw the weapon into the river, and then returned. If this was the case, then naturally there should be two sets of tracks in the snow! Those from heading out to the bridge, and those from coming back.Bikini:\n... Ah...! You're right!von Karma:\nHmph... You are forgetting one thing, Miles Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\n...?von Karma:\nOn the night of the murder, it was snowing. The tracks leading to the bridge were erased by the snowfall. This removes your precious contradiction, now doesn't it!Judge:\nI see! While she was at the river, the snow stopped... ...leaving just the return tracks in the snow.von Karma:\nWhat do you have to say now, Miles Edgeworth!Edgeworth:\n(Is there a flaw in her theory...? This idea that the snowfall covered one set of tracks...?)It's flawless.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...The tracks leading to the bridge were covered by the snow.\nEdgeworth:\nI do not have any evidence that can dispute this claim.\nvon Karma:\n...In which case, the rest is simple. Sister. Who was the only person who could have driven the snowmobile that night?\nBikini:\nWell... that would be...!\nvon Karma:\n...You can't hide it. I already know the answer.\nBikini:\n......... It could only be Iris.\nJudge:\nA-And the reason being...!?\nBikini:\nThere is only one key for the snowmobile.\nvon Karma:\nA key... that the defendant is responsible for!\nEdgeworth:\nWhaaaaat!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Now I don't feel like a clueless Puck Bunny! I understand everything! If the defendant did indeed use the snowmobile... ...which means that Iris is most definitely the murder--\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Your Honor! Please, wait a moment.\nJudge:\nWhat is it, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nThere is one gaping hole in Ms. von Karma's claim!\nJudge:\n... I'm not sure if I care for your response, Mr. Edgeworth. Next time, bring up whatever issues you have earlier. Do you understand!?\nEdgeworth:\nNngh... (I should have noticed it sooner...!)\nLeads to:\n\"The tracks to the river were covered by snow... What a nice theory.\"There is a contradiction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The tracks to the river were covered by snow... What a nice theory.\"Edgeworth:\nThe tracks to the river were covered by snow... What a nice theory. However, Ms. von Karma... That is impossible.von Karma:\n... Would you care to explain... ...why there is a rude index finger currently pointed in my general direction?Edgeworth:\n...No need. The evidence will do all of the talking for me.Judge:\nOn the night of the murder the killer went to, and returned from, Dusky Bridge... ...in order to dispose of the murder weapon. The outgoing tracks were erased by snow. ...Or so claims Ms. von Karma. Mr. Edgeworth! Present your evidence to the contrary, eh! Evidence that the outgoing tracks were not covered by snow!Present Weather Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWitness! Please tell us again what time it was when you witnessed the crime.\nBikini:\nLike I said! It was around 11.\nEdgeworth:\n...Of course, this means that the weapon was thrown away after that time, correct? On that note... Please take a look at this data. It is the weather report for Eagle Mountain on the night of the murder.\nJudge:\nThe... weather report...?\nEdgeworth:\nSnow started to fall at 7 PM... But it stopped at around 10:50.\nvon Karma:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nTherefore! When the Sister witnessed the crime at 11 PM... ...the snow had already stopped falling! It is impossible for any tracks made after that time to have been covered up!\nvon Karma:\nAaah!\nJudge:\nO-Order! Order!\nJudge:\nVery well then... It looks like Ms. von Karma's claim has been... snowed in. Waaaaaah!\nvon Karma:\n...It's too soon to be closing this trial due to snow! Miles Edgeworth! How pathetic of you to rely on the weather of all things!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nvon Karma:\nAnswer me this, then! When is a weather report ever correct!?\nJudge:\nAh, no, no no... You've got it all wrong. This isn't a forecast... This is... actual data... Gyaaaaah!\nvon Karma:\nForecast, data, all weather reports have some inaccuracies! It may have still been snowing in the vicinity well past 11 PM!\nJudge:\nHmmmm... It's true. We cannot be totally sure, eh!\nEdgeworth:\nW-What!? (How did she pull that off!?)\nJudge:\n\"It had stopped snowing at Hazakura Temple when the murder took place.\" ...You need to provide conclusive evidence of this.\nEdgeworth:\n(I've come this far... There's no turning back now.) ...Very well. I, too, cannot allow any doubt to remain concerning this testimony.\nvon Karma:\nHah... You can't back down, can you? Such a perfectionist, Miles Edgeworth!\nJudge:\nVery well then... Mr. Edgeworth! Where is your evidence that it had already stopped snowing when the victim was killed!?\n\n\n\nPresent Crime Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ultimately, it all comes down to one point.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nJudge:\n... Your response, Ms. von Karma?\nvon Karma:\nIt looks like... It is still snowing in your heart, too. Shivering in the cold, you are closing your eyes to the truth...\nEdgeworth:\n...!\nJudge:\nAnd to think you just arrived after a long, tiring flight from Germany. That was poetry. Pure poetry.\nEdgeworth:\n(This evidence is only going to freeze my case solid.)\nvon Karma:\nRespond! Miles Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nEven if it is snowing in my heart... At the time of the murder... it had already stopped snowing at Hazakura Temple!\nLeads back to:\n\"Very well then... Mr. Edgeworth!\"Present Crime Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ultimately, it all comes down to one point.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nHere is the evidence! What do you have to say, Your Honor...?\nJudge:\n... ...This reminds me of when I was a little hockey goon in training... When I was a child, I hoped for school to be canceled due to heavy snowfall. Perhaps, Mr. Edgeworth, it would've been better for you had court been snowed in. ...That's all this evidence says to me, in any case.\nEdgeworth:\n... Nothing else...?\nJudge:\nNothing else.\nvon Karma:\nOh dear... You seem to have missed, Miles Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nNngh...!\nEdgeworth:\n(According to the witness's testimony, the incident occurred after 11 PM... In which case... ...there has to be evidence that can undeniably prove something doesn't match up!)\nLeads back to:\n\"On the night of the murder the killer went to, and returned from, Dusky Bridge...\"Edgeworth:\nUltimately, it all comes down to one point. That being... Whether or not it was snowing in that courtyard when the victim was stabbed...von Karma:\nThat's right. But proving that is...Edgeworth:\nIncredibly easy.von Karma:\n...!Edgeworth:\nIf we want to know whether it was snowing or not, this photo will tell us everything. Of course, I am referring to the photo of the crime scene. As you can see... everything is covered with snow. ...With just one exception.von Karma:\nAnd that is...?Edgeworth:\nThe victim herself, Ms. Elise Deauxnim! Why is there no snow on top of her...? The answer is simple! It had stopped snowing when she was killed, that's why!von Karma:\nGnnngh!Edgeworth:\nIn other words! If the killer really did go to the Eagle River to dispose of the murder weapon... ...then in this photograph, there should be two sets of tracks!von Karma:\nAaaaah!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Just what are you... Gyahaah!von Karma:\nJ-Just what are you suggesting, Miles Edgeworth!?Edgeworth:\n(To be honest... I am not entirely sure myself. But...) This is simply what all of the facts point to. That night... someone used the snowmobile to leave Hazakura Temple. From the tracks left, it can be understood that they were heading for Dusky Bridge. At that time... it was still snowing.von Karma:\nOf course it was. Because those tracks were erased by the snow. (Changed from [Of course it was. Because those tracks were gone.] in the original release)Edgeworth:\nThen when this person returned to Hazakura Temple... ...the snow had stopped. Thus, the return tracks remained.Judge:\nHmmmmm...Bikini:\nCan I say something? This all sounds a bit fishy to me...von Karma:\n...What does, Sister?Bikini:\nThere is only one key for the snowmobile.Edgeworth:\n...!von Karma:\nFurthermore, on the night in question, we know that the defendant had it! The key was found in her room after the murder!Bikini:\n...Which can only mean, that night... Iris used the snowmobile to go to the Inner Temple...Edgeworth:\n(But... Iris said that she never went there... I should probably press on this point some more when I get the chance...)Bikini:\nThe snowmobile can't cross the suspension bridge... So, she must have left it on the Hazakura side of the bridge and crossed on foot.Judge:\n...That sounds right.Bikini:\nBut... What's odd is, when I left Iris and returned to Hazakura Temple... I didn't see anything near Dusky Bridge.von Karma:\nY-You must have just failed to see it, Sister.Bikini:\nMaybe... But when I made it back to Hazakura Temple... ...it was there, by the Main Gate... The snowmobile, I mean. I know what I saw. It was covered in snow, too...Edgeworth:\nB-But that... isn't possible!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order in the court! ...What does this all mean?von Karma:\n...Nngh...Edgeworth:\nSo then what was the snowmobile used for...? It wasn't taken by the defendant when she went to the Inner Temple. If it had been, then the witness couldn't possibly have seen it by the gate. Furthermore... it wasn't used by the killer to dispose of the murder weapon. If that was the case, there should be two sets of tracks in this photo. All we know is this... After it stopped snowing... someone used the snowmobile to return to Hazakura Temple!Judge:\nHmmmmmm...Edgeworth:\n(I never thought a simple snowmobile could cause so much trouble...)Judge:\n... I think we've learned all we can from this witness... (Changed from [I think we've arrived at this point due to the witness...] in the original release)Bikini:\nYes, yes. I've nothing more to add. I've told you everything -- everything that I know.Judge:\nBut then... that still leaves us with the same problem. (Changed from [Well then... That still leaves us with the same problem.] in the original release) If only there was someone... A witness who could testify to having seen the snowmobile!Edgeworth:\n(A witness, huh...)Judge:\nWas there no one out, walking perhaps, near Dusky Bridge on that night?Bikini:\n... I don't think that's likely. It was cold enough to freeze your ears off. Only an idiot would go out wandering in that. ...Unless they had something really important to do.Judge:\nHmmmm... That's a shame.Edgeworth:\n(Hold on... Something is coming to me... An idiot may well have gone wandering out on that sub-arctic night!) ...Your Honor! Actually... there just might be one individual who may be of help to us. (Changed from [I actually have an idea... There may be one individual able to help us.] in the original release)Judge:\nR-Really!?von Karma:\n...You know of someone who might have seen the snowmobile on the night of the murder...?Edgeworth:\nI don't know for sure if he saw it or not... But there are two things about him that do come to mind.Judge:\nWhich are...?Edgeworth:\nFirst... that he saw \"something incredible\" on the night of the murder.von Karma:\n...And the second being?Edgeworth:\nThis individual that I am thinking of went wandering outside on that cold night... In other words, he is our kind of idiot.Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth!

We only have 20 minutes. There are two things which I need to ask you before we reconvene.Iris:\n...Alright. I'll help you any way I can.Edgeworth:\nFirst, about that night. You really didn't go to the Inner Temple, correct? The last witness claims to have met and talked with you in the Training Hall. Either you or Sister Bikini... ...is lying.Iris:\n... Mr. Edgeworth. It is just as I said yesterday. Until the incident occurred... I was in my own room, in Hazakura Temple.Edgeworth:\n...Very well. The second thing, then. That night, the temple snowmobile was used in between the time Sister Bikini... ...returned to the Main Hall and when she bore witness to the murder. Sometime between 10:30 and 11 PM that night. Were you the one who used the snowmobile?Iris:\n... There is only one key for the snowmobile. The only person who could have used it... was me.Edgeworth:\nSo it was you...! But... why? ...What made you go out to Dusky Bridge?Iris:\n... I'm sorry, Mr. Edgeworth.5 PSYCHE-LOCKSEdgeworth:\nIris...Iris:\nI can't... tell you about that... yet.Edgeworth:\n\"Yet\"...?Iris:\nNot until her safety is confirmed...Edgeworth:\nHer?Iris:\nThe safety of the acolyte...Edgeworth:\n(The \"acolyte\", huh... She's must be talking about Maya...) ... Iris. Look me in the eye and tell me the truth. Did you kill Elise Deauxnim?Iris:\n... No matter who or what may come... I could never take a life.Edgeworth:\n... (As I thought... no Psycholocks...) ...Very well. It is my job to get to the truth. You'll discover this for yourself soon enough.February 9, 11:36 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 7Judge:\n...Court will now reconvene. Ms. von Karma. Where is the witness...?von Karma:\nDuring the break, a man was detained for suspicious behavior in the gallery.Edgeworth:\nSuspicious behavior...?von Karma:\nHe was sketching something... Very intensely.Judge:\nDare I ask what the witness was sketching when he was detained?von Karma:\nHe drew a terrifying woman, armed with a demonic face and a vicious whip.Judge:\n... I can only presume that his intention was to capture you-- ...Aaaah!von Karma:\nAnyway, it's time to drag this pathetic excuse for an artist before the court! Laurice Deauxnim! I hope you're ready... Get in here!Edgeworth:\n(It would seem that whip is going to see plenty more use today...)Butz:\nOuch!von Karma:\n...Your sketch is in contempt of this court!Butz:\nH-Hey! I was just artistically rendering... Ou-Ouch!von Karma:\nYou tried to run away from the bailiff who was trying to hand you your subpoena, correct?Butz:\nL-Look! I'm nothing but a fledgling artist, training out in the mountains! I'm only down here in the city because I ran out of green paint. Well, to use the technical term for the color, \"viridian\".Edgeworth:\n...Larry... This isn't an art store, now is it...?Butz:\nI know! I graduated junior high, OK!? Look. Art is all about working in the fields, isn't it?Judge:\nWorking in the fields...?Edgeworth:\nI presume he wanted to say \"field work\"... I hope.Butz:\nTh-That's it! Thanks, buddy!Edgeworth:\n(It's kind of sad that I was able to understand his mangled train wreck of a sentence...)Butz:\nI just happened to stop in here and found a wonderful new model!von Karma:\n...Butz:\nSo see!? I've got nothing to do with this trial! At all! I expect all of your faces to be red when you realize this mistake! Bright red! Or, to use the technical term, \"crimson lake\". ...Ou-Ou-Ouch! Ou-Ou-Ou-Ouch! Ouch!Judge:\nOu-Ou-Ou-Ouch! Ouch! Ou-Ouch!von Karma:\nStop your pathetic blabbing and testify like a man!Judge:\nRefrain from whipping me, Ms. von Karma! Cross-whipping is as bad as cross-checking. Witness! That was all your fault! Testify, now!Butz:\nWaaaah... This is almost too much for me...!Witness Testimony-- What I Saw --Butz:\nI was at that lodge out in the mountains, looking up at the stars that night.\nI walked to the bridge a number of times, but...\nI didn't see a s-snowmobile!\nI didn't see anyone at the bridge that night either! (Changed from [I didn't meet anyone at the bridge that night!] in the original release)\nThe girl I was waiting for didn't show up... My teacher died on me...\nI'm all alone now. Aren't I, Edgeyyyyy...!?Judge:\nWitness! Please refrain from talking directly to the lawyers during your testimony!Butz:\nI-I'm just a nobody! Nothing but a small, worthless man, aren't I!? And why wasn't I asked for my name and occupation... or anything else...!?Judge:\n... Mr. Edgeworth. This man seems to have quite a severe inferiority complex.Edgeworth:\n...He's recently been the cause of numerous incidents. I think he's finally realized for himself... ...just how much of a nuisance he has been to other people!Butz:\nYeah, that's right! I'm behind everything, every case! Watch out, OK! Just touching me will make you eternally unhappy!Judge:\n...Well then, let us proceed with the cross-examination. With no touching, thank you. We can delve into other details at a later time.Cross Examination",

    "newContext": "-- Location of the Weapon --Bikini:\nI saw the murder at around 11 PM...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...You are sure about the time?\nBikini:\nYes... I was worried about it, after all.\nJudge:\nWhy was that?\nBikini:\nBecause I have a strong sense of responsibility. Especially at this time of year. The acolyte was being doused in freezing water at the time... I couldn't very well take it easy in the bath all night now, could I? So at 11, I decided to leave Hazakura Temple.\nEdgeworth:\n(Her estimation of the time seems reliable, at least.)\nvon Karma:\nPlease continue, Sister.Bikini:\nAnd after asking that it be reported, I went out to the Main Gate.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou asked Phoenix Wright to report the crime, correct?\nBikini:\nRight, right, the one who trampled me.\nEdgeworth:\n(It seems she is the type to hold a grudge...)\nBikini:\nThere isn't a phone in the Main Hall, so I sent him to the bridge.\nvon Karma:\nPhoenix Wright... He didn't even have his cell phone on him?\nEdgeworth:\nHe had forgotten it at home, apparently.\nvon Karma:\nWhat a naïve boy, as always! Not only do I always carry my phone, but I always have my whip in hand, too!\nBikini:\nAnyway, I was really scared... And it was taking him a while to get back... So I thought I'd go out by the Main Gate for a spell.Bikini:\nAnd there... I saw tracks! Tracks that indicated the snowmobile had been used!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nAs I recall, there was a snowmobile outside the Main Gate when I visited.\nBikini:\nThat's it. That's the only one we have. It'll run no matter how much snow falls!\nEdgeworth:\nNow, you're certain the snowmobile was there at the Main Gate when you arrived?\nBikini:\nYes, of course. It was parked in front of the gate.\nvon Karma:\nSo... she had already gone, discarded the murder weapon, and returned by that time.\nEdgeworth:\n(...I'm not sure if this is really relevant... What should I do...?)\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(...I need answers to every possible doubt.) The snowmobile in question... Was it still warm at that time?\nBikini:\nHuh? Huh? Huh? Huh? What do you mean? What do you mean?\nJudge:\nWhat do you mean, eh?\nvon Karma:\nWhat do you mean, Miles Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\n(...I'm playing to a slow crowd here.) It goes without saying that using a snowmobile will heat its engine. If it was still warm, then it means it was recently used.\nBikini:\nAh! I see! I never thought of that!\nJudge:\nHmmm, that's right! I overlooked that, too!\nvon Karma:\n...Of course you did.\nEdgeworth:\nThen answer the question please, witness.\nBikini:\n... I don't often go around touching hot engines...\nEdgeworth:\n...Hmm.\nBikini:\nHowever... Now that you mention it... There wasn't any snow on it.\nJudge:\nSnow...?\nBikini:\nYes. For some reason, only the snowmobile wasn't covered in snow...\nEdgeworth:\n(There wasn't any snow on it!? Curses!)\nJudge:\nIt seems highly likely that the killer did use the snowmobile then, eh!\nvon Karma:\nHow long does it take to get to Dusky Bridge by snowmobile?\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nStop here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(It looks very likely that the snowmobile is related to this case. I can't help but think that Iris used it... But for what...? I'd better hold off on this... for now.)\nJudge:\n...Well then, witness.\nJudge:\nHow long does it take to reach the bridge by snowmobile?\nLeads back to cross-examinationBikini:\nIt takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, but less than 5 using one of those!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nIn that case... why didn't you use it yourself? You could've spared yourself some walking.\nBikini:\nAh! There's a reason for that! Have we got a moment for me to explain?\nJudge:\nI think that's why the question was asked in the first place...\nBikini:\n...It was about a month ago. I was driving my beloved little snowmobile, happy as can be. I'd fetched some water and was heading back when I went and crashed into a tree! The tree and my back both went crunch. Just like that. Crunch.\nJudge:\nHmm... Crunch.\nBikini:\n...I haven't been able to find the courage to ride anything since then...\nBikini:\nAnyway, the killer must have used it!Bikini:\nMaybe they threw the weapon into Eagle River and came back while I was knocked out?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nRefresh our memory. How long were you knocked out for...?\nBikini:\nLike I said, somewhere between 10 to 20 minutes.\nvon Karma:\nIt's possible to get to the bridge and back in 10 minutes using the snowmobile...\nEdgeworth:\n...I have to concede that is more than enough time.\nvon Karma:\nIs that all you wish to concede, Miles Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n...Present Tracks Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I admit this photograph proves something.\"Bikini:\n...Iris could have done that. She can drive a snowmobile after all...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhile it would have been possible, time-wise... ...one element remains out of place here.\nJudge:\nOh? And what would this mystery element be?\nEdgeworth:\nThe killer's reasoning, Your Honor. \"Why did the killer do all of this?\" Why go to the Eagle River to dispose of the murder weapon when there are other methods?\nJudge:\nHmm... Too many unanswered questions! Your response, Ms. von Karma? Waaaaaaaah!\nvon Karma:\nTurning to me for help over the slightest thing! Why don't you think for yourself once in a while? ...Your Honor.\nJudge:\nWhaaaaat!?\nEdgeworth:\n(She's as over the top as always...)\nvon Karma:\nA-Anyway... Whatever the reason, the fact remains that the defendant could have done this! The murder weapon was disposed of in the river! Another point to me, Miles Edgeworth!Present Tracks Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I admit this photograph proves something.\"Edgeworth:\n(Another mystery to feed the fire... \"Was there any reason to go and throw away the murder weapon\"...? Luckily, there is surely a problem with this testimony. Now all I have to do is start poking holes in this flawed account...)Edgeworth:\nI admit this photograph proves something. It proves that the snowmobile was used on the night of the murder.von Karma:\nYou've finally accepted the inevitable, it seems... Miles Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\nHowever... If what the witness says is true, why is there only one set of tracks?von Karma:\nWhat do you mean...?Edgeworth:\nIris left Hazakura Temple, threw the weapon into the river, and then returned. If this was the case, then naturally there should be two sets of tracks in the snow! Those from heading out to the bridge, and those from coming back.Bikini:\n... Ah...! You're right!von Karma:\nHmph... You are forgetting one thing, Miles Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\n...?von Karma:\nOn the night of the murder, it was snowing. The tracks leading to the bridge were erased by the snowfall. This removes your precious contradiction, now doesn't it!Judge:\nI see! While she was at the river, the snow stopped... ...leaving just the return tracks in the snow.von Karma:\nWhat do you have to say now, Miles Edgeworth!Edgeworth:\n(Is there a flaw in her theory...? This idea that the snowfall covered one set of tracks...?)It's flawless.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...The tracks leading to the bridge were covered by the snow.\nEdgeworth:\nI do not have any evidence that can dispute this claim.\nvon Karma:\n...In which case, the rest is simple. Sister. Who was the only person who could have driven the snowmobile that night?\nBikini:\nWell... that would be...!\nvon Karma:\n...You can't hide it. I already know the answer.\nBikini:\n......... It could only be Iris.\nJudge:\nA-And the reason being...!?\nBikini:\nThere is only one key for the snowmobile.\nvon Karma:\nA key... that the defendant is responsible for!\nEdgeworth:\nWhaaaaat!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Now I don't feel like a clueless Puck Bunny! I understand everything! If the defendant did indeed use the snowmobile... ...which means that Iris is most definitely the murder--\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Your Honor! Please, wait a moment.\nJudge:\nWhat is it, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nThere is one gaping hole in Ms. von Karma's claim!\nJudge:\n... I'm not sure if I care for your response, Mr. Edgeworth. Next time, bring up whatever issues you have earlier. Do you understand!?\nEdgeworth:\nNngh... (I should have noticed it sooner...!)\nLeads to:\n\"The tracks to the river were covered by snow... What a nice theory.\"There is a contradiction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The tracks to the river were covered by snow... What a nice theory.\"Edgeworth:\nThe tracks to the river were covered by snow... What a nice theory. However, Ms. von Karma... That is impossible.von Karma:\n... Would you care to explain... ...why there is a rude index finger currently pointed in my general direction?Edgeworth:\n...No need. The evidence will do all of the talking for me.Judge:\nOn the night of the murder the killer went to, and returned from, Dusky Bridge... ...in order to dispose of the murder weapon. The outgoing tracks were erased by snow. ...Or so claims Ms. von Karma. Mr. Edgeworth! Present your evidence to the contrary, eh! Evidence that the outgoing tracks were not covered by snow!Present Weather Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWitness! Please tell us again what time it was when you witnessed the crime.\nBikini:\nLike I said! It was around 11.\nEdgeworth:\n...Of course, this means that the weapon was thrown away after that time, correct? On that note... Please take a look at this data. It is the weather report for Eagle Mountain on the night of the murder.\nJudge:\nThe... weather report...?\nEdgeworth:\nSnow started to fall at 7 PM... But it stopped at around 10:50.\nvon Karma:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nTherefore! When the Sister witnessed the crime at 11 PM... ...the snow had already stopped falling! It is impossible for any tracks made after that time to have been covered up!\nvon Karma:\nAaah!\nJudge:\nO-Order! Order!\nJudge:\nVery well then... It looks like Ms. von Karma's claim has been... snowed in. Waaaaaah!\nvon Karma:\n...It's too soon to be closing this trial due to snow! Miles Edgeworth! How pathetic of you to rely on the weather of all things!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nvon Karma:\nAnswer me this, then! When is a weather report ever correct!?\nJudge:\nAh, no, no no... You've got it all wrong. This isn't a forecast... This is... actual data... Gyaaaaah!\nvon Karma:\nForecast, data, all weather reports have some inaccuracies! It may have still been snowing in the vicinity well past 11 PM!\nJudge:\nHmmmm... It's true. We cannot be totally sure, eh!\nEdgeworth:\nW-What!? (How did she pull that off!?)\nJudge:\n\"It had stopped snowing at Hazakura Temple when the murder took place.\" ...You need to provide conclusive evidence of this.\nEdgeworth:\n(I've come this far... There's no turning back now.) ...Very well. I, too, cannot allow any doubt to remain concerning this testimony.\nvon Karma:\nHah... You can't back down, can you? Such a perfectionist, Miles Edgeworth!\nJudge:\nVery well then... Mr. Edgeworth! Where is your evidence that it had already stopped snowing when the victim was killed!?\n\n\n\nPresent Crime Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ultimately, it all comes down to one point.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nJudge:\n... Your response, Ms. von Karma?\nvon Karma:\nIt looks like... It is still snowing in your heart, too. Shivering in the cold, you are closing your eyes to the truth...\nEdgeworth:\n...!\nJudge:\nAnd to think you just arrived after a long, tiring flight from Germany. That was poetry. Pure poetry.\nEdgeworth:\n(This evidence is only going to freeze my case solid.)\nvon Karma:\nRespond! Miles Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nEven if it is snowing in my heart... At the time of the murder... it had already stopped snowing at Hazakura Temple!\nLeads back to:\n\"Very well then... Mr. Edgeworth!\"Present Crime Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ultimately, it all comes down to one point.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nHere is the evidence! What do you have to say, Your Honor...?\nJudge:\n... ...This reminds me of when I was a little hockey goon in training... When I was a child, I hoped for school to be canceled due to heavy snowfall. Perhaps, Mr. Edgeworth, it would've been better for you had court been snowed in. ...That's all this evidence says to me, in any case.\nEdgeworth:\n... Nothing else...?\nJudge:\nNothing else.\nvon Karma:\nOh dear... You seem to have missed, Miles Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nNngh...!\nEdgeworth:\n(According to the witness's testimony, the incident occurred after 11 PM... In which case... ...there has to be evidence that can undeniably prove something doesn't match up!)\nLeads back to:\n\"On the night of the murder the killer went to, and returned from, Dusky Bridge...\"Edgeworth:\nUltimately, it all comes down to one point. That being... Whether or not it was snowing in that courtyard when the victim was stabbed...von Karma:\nThat's right. But proving that is...Edgeworth:\nIncredibly easy.von Karma:\n...!Edgeworth:\nIf we want to know whether it was snowing or not, this photo will tell us everything. Of course, I am referring to the photo of the crime scene. As you can see... everything is covered with snow. ...With just one exception.von Karma:\nAnd that is...?Edgeworth:\nThe victim herself, Ms. Elise Deauxnim! Why is there no snow on top of her...? The answer is simple! It had stopped snowing when she was killed, that's why!von Karma:\nGnnngh!Edgeworth:\nIn other words! If the killer really did go to the Eagle River to dispose of the murder weapon... ...then in this photograph, there should be two sets of tracks!von Karma:\nAaaaah!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Just what are you... Gyahaah!von Karma:\nJ-Just what are you suggesting, Miles Edgeworth!?Edgeworth:\n(To be honest... I am not entirely sure myself. But...) This is simply what all of the facts point to. That night... someone used the snowmobile to leave Hazakura Temple. From the tracks left, it can be understood that they were heading for Dusky Bridge. At that time... it was still snowing.von Karma:\nOf course it was. Because those tracks were erased by the snow. (Changed from [Of course it was. Because those tracks were gone.] in the original release)Edgeworth:\nThen when this person returned to Hazakura Temple... ...the snow had stopped. Thus, the return tracks remained.Judge:\nHmmmmm...Bikini:\nCan I say something? This all sounds a bit fishy to me...von Karma:\n...What does, Sister?Bikini:\nThere is only one key for the snowmobile.Edgeworth:\n...!von Karma:\nFurthermore, on the night in question, we know that the defendant had it! The key was found in her room after the murder!Bikini:\n...Which can only mean, that night... Iris used the snowmobile to go to the Inner Temple...Edgeworth:\n(But... Iris said that she never went there... I should probably press on this point some more when I get the chance...)Bikini:\nThe snowmobile can't cross the suspension bridge... So, she must have left it on the Hazakura side of the bridge and crossed on foot.Judge:\n...That sounds right.Bikini:\nBut... What's odd is, when I left Iris and returned to Hazakura Temple... I didn't see anything near Dusky Bridge.von Karma:\nY-You must have just failed to see it, Sister.Bikini:\nMaybe... But when I made it back to Hazakura Temple... ...it was there, by the Main Gate... The snowmobile, I mean. I know what I saw. It was covered in snow, too...Edgeworth:\nB-But that... isn't possible!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order in the court! ...What does this all mean?von Karma:\n...Nngh...Edgeworth:\nSo then what was the snowmobile used for...? It wasn't taken by the defendant when she went to the Inner Temple. If it had been, then the witness couldn't possibly have seen it by the gate. Furthermore... it wasn't used by the killer to dispose of the murder weapon. If that was the case, there should be two sets of tracks in this photo. All we know is this... After it stopped snowing... someone used the snowmobile to return to Hazakura Temple!Judge:\nHmmmmmm...Edgeworth:\n(I never thought a simple snowmobile could cause so much trouble...)Judge:\n... I think we've learned all we can from this witness... (Changed from [I think we've arrived at this point due to the witness...] in the original release)Bikini:\nYes, yes. I've nothing more to add. I've told you everything -- everything that I know.Judge:\nBut then... that still leaves us with the same problem. (Changed from [Well then... That still leaves us with the same problem.] in the original release) If only there was someone... A witness who could testify to having seen the snowmobile!Edgeworth:\n(A witness, huh...)Judge:\nWas there no one out, walking perhaps, near Dusky Bridge on that night?Bikini:\n... I don't think that's likely. It was cold enough to freeze your ears off. Only an idiot would go out wandering in that. ...Unless they had something really important to do.Judge:\nHmmmm... That's a shame.Edgeworth:\n(Hold on... Something is coming to me... An idiot may well have gone wandering out on that sub-arctic night!) ...Your Honor! Actually... there just might be one individual who may be of help to us. (Changed from [I actually have an idea... There may be one individual able to help us.] in the original release)Judge:\nR-Really!?von Karma:\n...You know of someone who might have seen the snowmobile on the night of the murder...?Edgeworth:\nI don't know for sure if he saw it or not... But there are two things about him that do come to mind.Judge:\nWhich are...?Edgeworth:\nFirst... that he saw \"something incredible\" on the night of the murder.von Karma:\n...And the second being?Edgeworth:\nThis individual that I am thinking of went wandering outside on that cold night... In other words, he is our kind of idiot.Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth! Who is this idiot you're talking aboot!?Present Larry Butz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This guy must be a product of \"Jean-Luc de Laduc's Guide To Obnoxious French Painting\"...\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nJudge:\nJust what is the meaning of this, Mr. Edgeworth...? Are you saying that... this is the person who was near Dusky Bridge that night?\nEdgeworth:\nI-I did think so, however... Aaah!\nvon Karma:\nYou're the wandering idiot, Miles Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nCool off before you try to take me on again! Ungh...! (What was I thinking!? This is the perfect chance to drag him onto the stand!)\nJudge:\nHmmmm... Mr. Edgeworth. This individual... Did they really see the snowmobile that night?\nLeads back to:\n\"I don't know for sure if he saw it or not...\"Judge:\nThis guy must be a product of \"Jean-Luc de Laduc's Guide To Obnoxious French Painting\"...Edgeworth:\nThis is Larry Butz... The student of the victim, Elise Deauxnim.Judge:\nHer student...? Interesting. Why was he wandering on the night of the murder?Edgeworth:\nT-That's... (I could tell them all about his designs for Iris... But it may cost us his credibility as a witness... Before I even call him.) He is, after all, an artist. He was, perhaps, searching for something in the snowy scenery that would move him. ...Although I cannot guarantee that this is the reason.von Karma:\nAnd so...? This unfortunate, unreliable-looking man... What exactly was it that he saw?Edgeworth:\nI intend to extract that from him, right here in this courtroom.Judge:\nSummon this youth as a witness immediately!von Karma:\n... I have no choice, do I?Edgeworth:\nI believe he is in the gallery for this trial. It will not take long to summon him.Judge:\n...Very well.Edgeworth:\n(Larry... You may have escaped me yesterday... But today I'm going to get everything out of you!)Judge:\n...The court will now adjourn for a 20 minute break. Ms. von Karma, please see to preparing the next witness.von Karma:\n...Understood, Your Honor.Judge:\nGood... Well then! Court is now in recess!To be continued.February 9, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Iris:\nExcuse me... Mr. Edgeworth? I'm not really sure what to say...Edgeworth:\nIris. We only have 20 minutes. There are two things which I need to ask you before we reconvene.Iris:\n...Alright. I'll help you any way I can.Edgeworth:\nFirst, about that night. You really didn't go to the Inner Temple, correct? The last witness claims to have met and talked with you in the Training Hall. Either you or Sister Bikini... ...is lying.Iris:\n... Mr. Edgeworth. It is just as I said yesterday. Until the incident occurred... I was in my own room, in Hazakura Temple.Edgeworth:\n...Very well. The second thing, then. That night, the temple snowmobile was used in between the time Sister Bikini... ...returned to the Main Hall and when she bore witness to the murder. Sometime between 10:30 and 11 PM that night. Were you the one who used the snowmobile?Iris:\n... There is only one key for the snowmobile. The only person who could have used it... was me.Edgeworth:\nSo it was you...! But... why? ...What made you go out to Dusky Bridge?Iris:\n... I'm sorry, Mr. Edgeworth.5 PSYCHE-LOCKSEdgeworth:\nIris...Iris:\nI can't... tell you about that... yet.Edgeworth:\n\"Yet\"...?Iris:\nNot until her safety is confirmed...Edgeworth:\nHer?Iris:\nThe safety of the acolyte...Edgeworth:\n(The \"acolyte\", huh... She's must be talking about Maya...) ... Iris. Look me in the eye and tell me the truth. Did you kill Elise Deauxnim?Iris:\n... No matter who or what may come... I could never take a life.Edgeworth:\n... (As I thought... no Psycholocks...) ...Very well. It is my job to get to the truth. You'll discover this for yourself soon enough.February 9, 11:36 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 7Judge:\n...Court will now reconvene. Ms. von Karma. Where is the witness...?von Karma:\nDuring the break, a man was detained for suspicious behavior in the gallery.Edgeworth:\nSuspicious behavior...?von Karma:\nHe was sketching something... Very intensely.Judge:\nDare I ask what the witness was sketching when he was detained?von Karma:\nHe drew a terrifying woman, armed with a demonic face and a vicious whip.Judge:\n... I can only presume that his intention was to capture you-- ...Aaaah!von Karma:\nAnyway, it's time to drag this pathetic excuse for an artist before the court! Laurice Deauxnim! I hope you're ready... Get in here!Edgeworth:\n(It would seem that whip is going to see plenty more use today...)Butz:\nOuch!von Karma:\n...Your sketch is in contempt of this court!Butz:\nH-Hey! I was just artistically rendering... Ou-Ouch!von Karma:\nYou tried to run away from the bailiff who was trying to hand you your subpoena, correct?Butz:\nL-Look! I'm nothing but a fledgling artist, training out in the mountains! I'm only down here in the city because I ran out of green paint. Well, to use the technical term for the color, \"viridian\".Edgeworth:\n...Larry... This isn't an art store, now is it...?Butz:\nI know! I graduated junior high, OK!? Look. Art is all about working in the fields, isn't it?Judge:\nWorking in the fields...?Edgeworth:\nI presume he wanted to say \"field work\"... I hope.Butz:\nTh-That's it! Thanks, buddy!Edgeworth:\n(It's kind of sad that I was able to understand his mangled train wreck of a sentence...)Butz:\nI just happened to stop in here and found a wonderful new model!von Karma:\n...Butz:\nSo see!? I've got nothing to do with this trial! At all! I expect all of your faces to be red when you realize this mistake! Bright red! Or, to use the technical term, \"crimson lake\". ...Ou-Ou-Ouch! Ou-Ou-Ou-Ouch! Ouch!Judge:\nOu-Ou-Ou-Ouch! Ouch! Ou-Ouch!von Karma:\nStop your pathetic blabbing and testify like a man!Judge:\nRefrain from whipping me, Ms. von Karma! Cross-whipping is as bad as cross-checking. Witness! That was all your fault! Testify, now!Butz:\nWaaaah... This is almost too much for me...!Witness Testimony-- What I Saw --Butz:\nI was at that lodge out in the mountains, looking up at the stars that night.\nI walked to the bridge a number of times, but...\nI didn't see a s-snowmobile!\nI didn't see anyone at the bridge that night either! (Changed from [I didn't meet anyone at the bridge that night!] in the original release)\nThe girl I was waiting for didn't show up... My teacher died on me...\nI'm all alone now. Aren't I, Edgeyyyyy...!?Judge:\nWitness! Please refrain from talking directly to the lawyers during your testimony!Butz:\nI-I'm just a nobody! Nothing but a small, worthless man, aren't I!? And why wasn't I asked for my name and occupation... or anything else...!?Judge:\n... Mr. Edgeworth. This man seems to have quite a severe inferiority complex.Edgeworth:\n...He's recently been the cause of numerous incidents. I think he's finally realized for himself... ...just how much of a nuisance he has been to other people!Butz:\nYeah, that's right! I'm behind everything, every case! Watch out, OK! Just touching me will make you eternally unhappy!Judge:\n...Well then, let us proceed with the cross-examination. With no touching, thank you. We can delve into other details at a later time.Cross Examination",

You are a spirit medium, after all.Maya:\nBut just like you, if I don't keep my powers sharp, they get dull, right?Phoenix:\nUm... I guess so, yeah.Maya:\nGlad you agree! OK, Pearly! You're up!Phoenix:\n(Pearls...?)Pearl:\nSo! That's why we need to go on a special \"Spiritual Hot Spot Tour\", Mr. Nick!Phoenix:\n...Huh? I'm lost.

It looks pretty well maintained, too. This thing kinda puts your hometown to shame, Maya.\nMaya:\nYeah... Well, a lot of things have happened in Kurain Village. We used to be a lot richer, back when people hired us to perform channelings.\nPhoenix:\nOh, I see... But now the place looks a bit run down...\nMaya:\nHmm... I guess I was just born in the wrong time.\n\n\n\n\nMain Hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nThat looks like the Main Hall where we'll be staying tonight. From here, it looks like one of those ice hotels you always hear about!\nPhoenix:\n...They gotta have a heater or something in there, don't you think? I don't wanna die.\nMaya:\nI'm not worried, I brought my hot-water bottle.\nPhoenix:\nDid you bring one for me?\nMaya:\nWhat are you talking about, Nick? Who carries around 2 hot-water bottles?\nPhoenix:\n(Brr! If the cold doesn't kill me, the ice queen over here will finish the job...)\n\n\n\n\nBell tower\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nOh, look! It's a cute little bell tower! I absolutely love the sound of a giant bell!\nPhoenix:\nOh? So, which do you like better? That or the sound of money?\nMaya:\n...! ...... Sorry, but I'll take money for the win, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What are you apologizing for?\n\n\n\n\nSnowmobile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nOh look, it's one of those snow motorcycle things!\nPhoenix:\nMost people call that a \"snowmobile\", you know.\nMaya:\n\"Snow motorcycle things\", \"Snowblowmeal\". Same thing. Hmm... Too bad we didn't invite Desirée. I bet she could race like the wind on this \"Slowmobile\"! Or maybe she'd give me ride on this \"Blowsnowbile\".\nPhoenix:\nArgh! I told you, it's \"snowmobile\"!Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanneling dojo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUmm... So what's a \"channeling dojo\" anyway?\nBikini:\nOh my, my, my... You don't even know that?\nMaya:\nForgive him, Sister, for he knows not what he is saying.\nBikini:\nWell, well, well. Just call me Bikini and forget that \"Sister\" part. A channeling dojo is basically a spiritual power training ground. We have special holy items prepared here to help people boost their spiritual power.\nPhoenix:\nH-Holy items...?\nBikini:\nIf you train an entire evening surrounded by these items... Aaah. It's quite mysterious. The spiritual power of these items seems to envelop you. Wa ha ha ha.\nPhoenix:\n(Wow, she must have just gotten off the trolley from the land of make-believe...)\nMaya:\nUm, so what exactly is the \"Special Course\"...?\nBikini:\nYou must be incredibly devoted to be interested in that at such a young age! It's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant a spell... ...30,000 times! All while being showered in freezing cold spirit water.\nMaya:\nEh...?\nBikini:\nIt's February now, right? You have to be careful this time of the year... If you don't watch it, you'll catch pneumonia or maybe even die of hypothermia... So be careful, you hear? Wa ha ha. Ho ho ho. Ha!\nMaya:\nHow am I supposed to \"be careful\"...?\nPearl:\nOh no... I knew I shouldn't have signed Mystic Maya up for this...\n\n\n\n\nThe other nun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUmm, Sister... About this picture...\nBikini:\nWell, well. Look at that. I must say I look rather divine here, don't you think?\nPhoenix:\nOh, um, yeah. Unforgettable in every way.\nBikini:\nYou mean it? Oh, I knew it! Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho ho! The makeup was pretty tough, but Iris helped me out.\nMaya:\n\"Iris\"...?\nBikini:\nThe cute little girl in the photo. She looks just like me, doesn't she? We're just a small temple here, so she and I run the entire place.\nMaya:\nReally? That kinda sounds like fu--\nPhoenix:\nSorry to cut in, but...! This \"Iris\"... Where is she right now?\nBikini:\nOh! Just listen to you! You haven't come all the way up here just to find a girlfriend, have you?\nPearl:\n... *glare*\nPhoenix:\nNo, no, no! Th-That's not what I had in mind at all...\nBikini:\nAnyway, Iris is in the Inner Temple preparing for this evening.\nMaya:\nInner Temple...?\nBikini:\nYes, yes, that's right. Iris will be back this evening. Why don't you go have a look at the Main Hall for now? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha.\nPhoenix:\n(So she's in the Inner Temple, huh...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm, do you think you could take a look at this?\nBikini:\nI may not look like it, but I can tell you I'm very much in demand. And to be quite honest, I'm finding this a little difficult to say...\nPearl:\n...What IS she trying to say, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI think she's trying to say that she's busy.\nMaya:\nBut seriously Nick, what's the deal? Nothing has even happened yet and you're already shoving evidence into people's faces. You need to forget about work and relax a little.\nPearl:\nTry to have some fun, OK Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, you're right... (Sure. Pin the hypothermia on the lawyer is great fun!)February 7Hazakura TempleMain HallMaya:\nBrr... It's fr-freezing in here, too! Achoo!Pearl:\nHee hee. It reminds me of the Meditation Room in Fey Manor!Phoenix:\n...Pearls, you've been in an unusually good mood since we got here.Pearl:\nWell, kids are made of energy, you know!Phoenix:\nAs for you, Maya, you look like you're about to catch a bad cold.Maya:\nW-W-Well, I'm not exactly a little kid anymore, I guess. Ah-Achoo!Phoenix:\n(Nngh... Is she going to make it...?)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSliding doors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI bet the writing on these sliding doors are instructions for spirit channeling... Kinda like how we scribbled math formulas on the bathroom walls to remember them. Except we couldn't go to the bathroom during tests... And I can't read these walls.\n\n\n\n\nObjects on floor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere are straw zabuton cushions arranged around a hibachi brazier... I haven't seen a layout like this since I saw this really old Japanese movie on TV. ...If it wasn't for this hibachi, they'd probably freeze to death.\n\n\n\n\nAltar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's an altar. It looks a bit old, but someone does a good job taking care of it. Speaking of altars, I remember seeing one like this in Kurain Village last year. I guess they really do have something to do with spiritual power after all.\n\n\n\n\nMagatama on altar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere's a laughably large Magatama on the altar. If I can see Psyche-Locks with the tiny Magatama I've got... ...I can only imagine what kind of power this bad boy has under his hood!\n\n\n\n\nLeft corner near altar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's a stack of straw zabuton cushions. Maya told me this type of zabuton is called \"enza\"... I suppose if I'd never come here, I'd have missed out on all these new things.February 7Suspension BridgeMaya:\nWow! Look at this broken down old bridge, Nick!Phoenix:\nY-Yeah, and look at that big canyon below us.Maya:\nHey! There's a river down there! It looks like it's flowing real fast! ...What's wrong, Nick? You look like you've seen a ghost!Phoenix:\nI-I'm just not very good with heights...Maya:\nOh... Hey! I've got it! Maybe you should face your fear and try hurling yourself off the edge? You know! One... Two... Three... Jump! It might be just what you need to get over your fear of heights!Phoenix:\n...Yeah, death is a real good way to overcome phobias alright. Anyway, it sure looks like a rickety bridge.Maya:\nCan't argue there. That's probably why it's called, \"Dusty Bridge\".Phoenix:\nRead it again, Maya. It says, \"Dusky Bridge\".Maya:\nWell, it's practically the same thing.Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCliff on opposite side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like it's about 20 yards to that cliff over there.\nMaya:\nI guess that's where I'll be training tonight. Do you want to train with me, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nAnd do the Special Course? I think not.\nMaya:\nBut it'd be so great if you had spiritual powers, too! (Really? \"I see dead people\" sounds more like a cause for alarm to me...)\n\n\n\n\nWooden sign on left side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere's a narrow path going off in a different direction than that of the Main Hall.\nMaya:\nThe sign here is so old, the text seems to have vanished.\nPhoenix:\nThe path leads to a wooden staircase that goes down to the bottom of the canyon.\nMaya:\nOK, I'll write, \"wooden staircase\" on it then.\nPhoenix:\n...Do you really think that is necessary? You'd have to be blind not to see the stairs.\nMaya:\nWell, it can't hurt. Just pass me a pencil, OK?\nPhoenix:\nGraffiti is a crime, Maya.\n\n\n\n\nBridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! Why don't we hop across the bridge. It'll be fun!\nPhoenix:\nI'm not so sure... It looks like a bunny hopping across the bridge would destroy it.\nMaya:\nOK, Nick. Then let's try to find a cute little white bunny and test your theory.\nPhoenix:\n(That right there sums up the fundamental difference between sane and insane.)\n\n\n\n\nBoulder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSome letters are engraved into a roughly cut boulder.\nMaya:\n\"D-U-S-T-Y Bridge\", huh?\nPhoenix:\nIt says, \"Dusky\"! \"Dusky Bridge\"! OK?\nMaya:\nC'mon, Nick! Take a look at that bridge and tell me it's not supposed to be \"Dusty\"! This sign is obviously wrong, and I'm gonna fix it! Now give me a pencil, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nDo I look like a pencil holder to you?\n\n\n\n\nPublic phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nI can't believe there's a public phone here. Who would ever use it?\nPhoenix:\nThe people who live here, I guess. I doubt they have any real phones there.\nMaya:\nYeah, but it took like 20 minutes to walk here from the Main Hall! ... It would've been smarter of them to build the Main Hall here, don't you think?\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe you should work on channeling someone who makes logical sense, Maya.After clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate:February 7Hazakura TempleMain HallMaya:\nTh-Th-The Main Hall... I th-think it's even c-c-c-colder in here! Achoo!Pearl:\nAh! Mr. Nick! Do you smell that? It smells like meat and gravy!Maya:\nYeah, you're right! I guess it's pot roast for tonight! Yum!Phoenix:\n...Weird. I thought they would serve something a little more... well, traditional.Maya:\nWhat are you talking about, Nick!? You think monks and nuns just sit around eating rice gruel all the time!?Pearl:\nMystic Maya is right! Ooh! I hope there's mashed potatoes, too! I love mashed potatoes!???:\nHa ha ha... What a cute little acolyte! Greetings to all of you.Phoenix:\nOh... Um, hello. (Wow, this lady makes Maya look like a 6.8/10 on the weirdness scale.)Maya:\nYour outfit... Did you come here for the Special Course, too...????:\nHa, ha, ha... Unfortunately, no. Actually, I'm...Pearl:\nAaaaaaaaaah! Y-You're...! Y-You're...! You're Ms. Elise Deauxnim!Elise:\nYes, that's right... You know of me?Pearl:\nM-M-My name... My name is Pearl Fey! I-I'm your biggest fan!Maya:\nWho is she, Nick?Phoenix:\nHmm... I see it now... Zvarri! A fortune-teller...?Pearl:\nI-I've got all your books, Ms. Deauxnim!Elise:\nHa, ha, ha... What a sweet thing to say. And please, call me Elise.Phoenix:\nUm, \"books\"...?Pearl:\nMr. Nick, don't you know anything!? Don't you even know who this is?Phoenix:\nWell, um... ...An author, maybe?Elise:\nYes, and an illustrator. ...Of picture books.Maya:\nPicture books, huh? Oh, now I get it...Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElise Deauxnim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... I'm sorry I didn't know who you are. I don't get a lot of chances to really enjoy picture books.\nElise:\nIt's alright. I take no offense to that. My books are nothing but simple stories for children.\nPearl:\nAnd really beautiful pictures too, Ms. Elise! Your books always make me feel as if my heart has been purified.\nElise:\nHa ha ha... It makes me feel very happy to hear you say that.\nPhoenix:\n(I do have to admit... She certainly seems like a kind, sensitive lady.)\nPearl:\nMs. Elise won an award last year for her book, \"The Magic Bottle\"!\nElise:\nYes... A friend of mine secretly submitted a story I had written to a publisher. They liked it so much that they asked if it was alright to make it into a book.\nPhoenix:\nWow... It must have been a really great story.\nMaya:\n...Maybe I should try to write a children's book, too. If I do, you can secretly send it to a publisher for me, Nick.\nElise:\nRecently, I've accepted a sort of... apprentice you might say.\nPhoenix:\nAn apprentice?\nElise:\nHe calls himself Laurice... Laurice Deauxnim. I believe he's off doing some landscape sketches now... On Laurice's behalf as well, I'd like to thank you for your support.\nPearl:\nOf course, Ms. Elise! Anything for you!\nElise:\nHa ha ha...\n\n\n\n\nWhy come here?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPearl:\nUm... Why did you come to Hazakura Temple, Ms. Elise? Are you here... to do some spiritual training?\nElise:\nHa ha ha... No, that's not it. I'm actually here to gather materials for a new book I'm working on.\nPearl:\nWow! I-I can't wait to read it!\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls is completely taken with her...)\nElise:\nI wanted to do a book with a more Japanese feel to it this time.\nPhoenix:\n...So is that why you're dressed like you are?\nElise:\nThe children have a certain image of me in their minds. I don't want to disappoint them...\nPhoenix:\n(What can I say... She's really a sweet lady...)\nPearl:\nWow, Ms. Elise, you're dressed up like a mountain nun!\nElise:\nYes. The good people here were kind enough to let me borrow this... I'm wearing training clothes underneath my robe, as well.\nMaya:\n...I want a staff like that.\nElise:\nYou like the crystal sphere? It's real amethyst, you know.\nMaya:\nMaybe we'll find one like that up here on this mountain. Good luck, Nick! I know you'll find me one!Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMs. Deauxnim? What do you think about this?\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Do you think Ms. Elise is a suspect?\nPhoenix:\nHuh...?\nPearl:\nYou may be Mystic Maya's special someone, but I won't let you do this to Ms. Elise!\nPhoenix:\n(A suspect? Why would I suspect her of anything? It's not like anything's happened.)\nMaya:\nIsn't it cute, Nick? Pearly's getting all overprotective of her new friend.After clearing all Talk options:Elise:\nWell, you'll have to excuse me now... I have to go help with the dinner preparations.Pearl:\nWow! You mean you're cooking dinner tonight?Elise:\nThat's right. Would you like to help too, Pearl?Pearl:\nYes, yes! I want to help with whatever I can!Phoenix:\n(Pearls looks like she just won the lottery...)Maya:\nOh, I'll help too, then...Elise:\n...No, it's fine. Please don't worry about it. Feel free to relax and explore the area with your friend.Maya:\nHuh!? But...Elise:\n...Oh, yes! Please take this. I think it will be of help to you. It's a map of the area. We wouldn't want you to get lost now, would we?Phoenix:\n(The \"Inner Temple\"... There it is, on the other side of the bridge...) Well, if you insist, I guess we'll take this chance to go check out the other temple.Hazakura Temple Map added to the Court Record.Pearl:\nOK! I'll see you two later then! Remember! You're not allowed to fight!Maya:\nCome on, Nick! Let's go! At least we'll stay warm if we keep moving!February 7Hazakura TempleMain GateMaya:\nHuh? Where did Sister Bikini go?Phoenix:\nI guess she went to the Inner Temple... To go help that other nun out.Maya:\nOh, right... I think her name is... Iris?Phoenix:\nY-Yeah... That was it. (I want to find out who Iris really is, but I'm scared of what I'll find...)Maya:\n...?February 7Inner Temple GateMaya:\nWhoa, that bridge was shaking like jello in an earthquake.Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nAnd at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I bet. (Changed from [And at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I'd bet.] in the original release)Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nNot to mention the last part only had like one board left on it!Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nWhat's wrong with you? Your face is all green.Phoenix:\nC-Can you not pick on me for a second? I'm still trying to get over the shock that we made it safely across that death trap.Maya:\nYeah, I guess I'm a bit surprised, too... Yikes! That \"temple\" is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse at any time... (Changed from [Yikes! That 'temple' is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse anytime...] in the original release)Phoenix:\nI guess people don't use it too often. Is this really where you're going to train tonight?Maya:\nThat has to be it. It's kinda creepy around here... Like a ghost might jump out at you or something!Phoenix:\n(A spirit medium afraid of ghosts...? Isn't it ironic, don't you think?)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI don't care how much you pay me, I don't want to cross that bridge again.\nMaya:\nNo worries, Nick. No one is offering you any money.\nPhoenix:\nThat's because no reasonable person would call that pile of popsicle sticks a bridge! The latter half of it was nothing more than a few planks of wood and some string!\nMaya:\nHey, if we want to get back, we've got no choice but to cross it again, you know.\nPhoenix:\n... Maybe I'll just stay... I've always dreamed of living in a little shack in the woods.\nMaya:\n...Wow, you really are scared, aren't you?\n\n\n\n\nSuspension wire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nIt looks like this bridge is suspended by 4 of these wires.\nPhoenix:\n...They're reeeally thin. Shouldn't they be just a little thicker...?\nMaya:\nOh, stop it! You're such a worrywart, Nick! If the bridge were really going to collapse... ...I'm pretty sure the boards would break before these wires ever did!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nWhat's wrong? You're turning into an over-ripe avocado again.\n\n\n\n\nBuddha statues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nOh, wow! Look at these neat Buddha statues. Maybe I'll take one home with me.\nPhoenix:\nMaya!\nMaya:\nBut there are so many. They wouldn't notice if I took just one.\nPhoenix:\nAre you kidding? Of course they'll notice! What are you gonna do with one of those anyway?\nMaya:\nPut it in the office of course! We can trade that wooden statue in the office reception area for one of these!\nPhoenix:\n(You know, come to think of it, where did that wooden statue come from anyway...?)\n\n\n\n\nIncinerator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nHey! There's a giant robot buried in the snow!\nPhoenix:\n... Well, there's something buried in the snow, but... I think it's an incinerator.\nMaya:\nOh... Hee hee. But you've gotta admit it looks a lot like a robot.\nPhoenix:\nUm, sure... Anyway, I don't think it gets used much. It's looking pretty rusty.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Do you think this Giant Robo-cinerator can walk?\nPhoenix:\nI told you! It's not a robot! ...And it's not especially big either.\nMaya:\nBah, you have no imagination. I thought it'd be real neat if you had to beat it to advance.\nPhoenix:\n(A fight between a lawyer and an overgrown furnace? Who'd ever pay to see that!?)\n\n\n\n\nYellow gate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nHey! A half-opened gate! That's practically a welcome mat!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, except the sign on here says, \"No Entry\".\nMaya:\nUmm, Nick. Rules are made to be broken, you know.\nPhoenix:\n...You expect a lawyer to go along with that?\nMaya:\nOh, come on! You're such an old lady sometimes! Let's just go!\nPhoenix:\nDon't blame it on me when Sister Bikini puts a curse on you.\nMaya:\n... Now you've got me scared. Um, let's just forget about it, OK?\n\n\n\n\nWooden log on left\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nLooks like there's something written on it.\nPhoenix:\nI can't read it, but if I had to take a good guess, I'd say it says, \"Inner Temple\".\nMaya:\nWhat's the point of a sign if you can't read it? Must be tough for the mailman when he's delivering here.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess the sign is a good indication of how long this place has been here...)\n\n\n\n\nGate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nSo that's the Inner Temple up ahead, huh?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks kinda run-down.\nMaya:\nWell, it wouldn't be very temple-like if it was all bright and shiny.\nPhoenix:\nSo you're training here tonight, huh?\nMaya:\nYup! Then everyone'll see my spiritual powers!\n...Uuurrrgh...ggnngh...ggh...\nPhoenix:\nSounds like your stomach wants to show off its digestive powers instead...\nMaya:\nI wonder if that roast is ready yet?February 7Inner TempleTraining HallPhoenix:\nMan, look at this place... It's just a tiny, freezing-cold room. So this is where you'll both be training, huh...Maya:\nHuh? What do you mean, \"both\"? I'm the only one.Phoenix:\nReally? But I thought...Maya:\nPearly's just a little kid. She couldn't handle this kind of intense training.Phoenix:\n(So says the girl who I can barely hear over her teeth chattering...) (Changed from [So says the girl who I can barely hear over her bones chattering...] in the original release)Maya:\nAnyway... The real training room must be behind that door over there. Hmm... Yup, definitely getting the feeling it's back there. (Changed from [Yeah, I get the feeling it's back there, definitely.] in the original release)Phoenix:\n(Even I can sense that there's something supernatural about the cavern behind that door...)

It-It's nothing...Maya:\nI wonder why she spaced out like that. Don't you, Nick?Phoenix:\nUh... D-Did you say something, M-Maya?Maya:\n... Not you too, Nick...Iris:\nI... M-My name is Iris. I'm one of the nuns here at this temple.Maya:\nI'm Maya Fey. It's a pleasure to meet you!Iris:\nThe pleasure is mine... ... Oh, er, please excuse me! I have some... um, chores to attend to.Maya:\nShe sure is beautiful... and a bit spacey, I guess...

Hmph... Nothing! Just a bunch of clothes. Hey, Nick.\nPhoenix:\n... Huh! Oh, sorry. I was just... thinking.\nMaya:\nOh? About Iris, I bet! Looks like you've been bitten by the love bug, Nick!\n\n\n\n\nMattresses\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere are a bunch of musty looking blankets and bedding sets piled up here. I wonder why they're even here in the first place? \nMaya:\nIt's because all spiritual training is done under the supervision of a nun. I wonder if Sister Bikini is planning to sleep in here while I train? \nPhoenix:\n(But if they sleep, what's the point of having them here in the first place...?)\n\n\n\n\nSacred cavern entrance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nThe actual training area must be on the other side of this door.

That's the special mark of the Master of our tradition.\nPhoenix:\n(So that's what the mark means...)\nMaya:\n...\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it?\nMaya:\nN-Nothing... It's just that...

And I'm just here to do a sketch of Dusky Bridge!Maya:\nSo... it really is our Larry. ...Not that I get why he's pretending to be someone else.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaurice Deauxnim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo what are you doing with the last name, \"Deauxnim\"?\nButz:\nWell I... I just... I wanted to start over again! With a clean slate!\nMaya:\nA clean slate...?\nButz:\nYou remember don't you? Last time?\nPhoenix:\n(The Mask☆DeMasque case...)\nButz:\nAfter that, I started to realize I didn't like this guy known as Larry Butz! And that's when I came across it... The book of destiny!\nMaya:\nThe \"book of destiny\"...? Do you mean...?\nButz:\n\"The Magic Bottle\"! By Ms. Elise Deauxnim! It's so beautiful... So moving... So... So gentle. My heart felt cleansed! I-I was saved!\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe I should buy a copy of \"The Magic Bottle\"...)\nMaya:\nWow, Larry would make a great book salesman! I really want to get that book now, too!\n\n\n\n\nElise Deauxnim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nShe's the most wonderful person I've ever met! I'd follow her anywhere!\nMaya:\nWell, she certainly is a very elegant lady.\nButz:\nYou see? You see? Here's a photo I took of her in secret!\nMaya:\nWow! That's a beautiful photo!\nButz:\nYou want a copy, don't you? It's OK... I just happened to have made extra prints!\nPhoto of Elise added to the Court Record.\n\n\n\n\nElise Deauxnim (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nShe's the most wonderful person I've ever met! I'd follow her anywhere!\nMaya:\nWell, she certainly is a very elegant lady.\nButz:\nYou see? You see? Here's a photo I took of her in secret!\nMaya:\nWow! That's a beautiful photo!\n\n\n\n\nPicture books\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nStill, it's kinda hard to imagine you as a picture book illustrator... So tell the truth. You must have some kind of ulterior motive, right?\nButz:\nWh-What're you talking about!? I don't... I don't trust anyone anymore... Especially not women!\nMaya:\n...Talk about a bad case of denial.\nPhoenix:\nAnyway... Can you even draw well enough to make a picture book?\nButz:\nArt isn't only about technical skill, you know. It's also about having a pure heart!\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's why I'm asking. Can you draw well enough to make a whole book?\nButz:\n...! Hmm... Now that you mention it... I wonder.\nMaya:\nIt looks like you still have some doubt in your heart.\nButz:\nIt's true, I do... But when I first saw her, I felt it! Something inside me ended, and something else began.\nMaya:\nOh Larry, it sounds like you've fallen in love with Ms. Elise Deauxnim!\nButz:\nNo! Y-You're wrong! It's not her... It's the other girl!\nPhoenix:\n\"Other girl\"...? Uh oh... (I got a bad feeling about this...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nWow! You're even cuter than the last time I saw you.\nMaya:\nOh, really!?\nButz:\nYeah, you look like a totally different person! Don't you think so, Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe it's 'cause we're always together, but she looks pretty much the same to me.)\n\n\n\n\nMia Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nHey, I remember her! That's Maya's big sister!\nMaya:\nWow! You really do remember!\nButz:\nYeah, who could forget! A couple of gorgeous sisters! Hubba hubba!\nMaya:\nYou hear that, Nick! Gorgeous!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh yeah... That's right. When I defended Larry... Mia was still alive...)\n\n\n\n\nPearl Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nI haven't seen her in a while, so I bet she's gotten a lot bigger.\nPhoenix:\nWell, it's only been 5 months since we celebrated Ron's non-guilty verdict.\nButz:\nMaybe so, but kids these days grow up so fast.\nPhoenix:\n...She hasn't changed a bit as far as I can tell.\nButz:\nCome on, Nick... I really doubt that. You just don't know 'cause you don't pay enough attention, that's all.\nPhoenix:\n(Sometimes I really worry about what goes on inside this guy's head...)\n\n\n\n\nBikini profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nShe seems really motherly, doesn't she?\nButz:\nWhat do you mean \"seems\" motherly? She IS my mother.\nMaya:\n...She's your WHAT!?\nButz:\nI'm gonna have to take a pass on answering that one.\nPhoenix:\n(Wait a second. Why is he getting off so easy this time...!?)\n\n\n\n\nElise Deauxnim profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nElise is really something. She's like a mother to me.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, you can tell from the kindness reflected in her eyes.\nButz:\nWhen I first looked into her eyes, I just couldn't help it. I started blabbing about all the bad things I had done in my life. She just laughed that gentle laugh of hers and listened!\nPhoenix:\n(Are you sure she wasn't just laughing at you...?)\n\n\n\n\nIris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nWhoo yeah! Her! My little Iris!\nMaya:\nShe's really pretty.\nButz:\nThis girl... She's perfect! She's exactly my type! I wonder if she would model for me. I want to draw a portrait of her.\nMaya:\nYeah, you always liked those model types, didn't you Larry? ...Hey, wait a sec! Didn't you say you were swearing off women...?\nButz:\nHuh!? Yeah, that's right. Of course I have! I have... basically. But...\nMaya:\n\"But\"...?\nButz:\nBut... Iris is different. I feel like... I feel like I still have one chance left at the dream...\nPhoenix:\n(This guy will never change.)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nHey, I know I may not look like it, but I'm an artist. I refuse to look at anything that doesn't have a radiant or beautiful motif.\nPhoenix:\n(Picky, picky, aren't you...?)After clearing all Talk options and presenting Iris profile:Pearl:\nEveryone!Maya:\nHey! Pearly!Pearl:\nDinner preparations are complete! Please come quickly to the Main Hall!Maya:\nAlright! I can't wait to dig in, Pearly!Pearl:\nI'm going to go to the Inner Temple and call Sister Iris! I also want to have a look at where Mystic Maya is going to be training...February 7, 7:46 PMHazakura TempleMain HallMaya:\nBoy am I stuffed...Phoenix:\nAre you sure it's alright to eat that much before your training?Maya:\nWell, this kind of training is a battle of endurance.Pearl:\nMystic Maya... Please don't do anything that might put your health at risk.Maya:\nHa ha ha. No pain, no gain, I guess.Pearl:\nNngh... I'm still worried about you...Bikini:\nWell, well, well. Let's not dilly-dally shilly-shally. You must get ready for tonight.Elise:\nGood luck. ...Maya.Maya:\nAlright! Here I go! I'll see you all tomorrow, I guess!Bikini:\nIris, please ring the bell at 10:00 for lights out, alright?Iris:\nYes, Sister Bikini.Bikini:\nAnd then, after you ring the bell, I want you to come join us at the Training Hall.Iris:\nI understand, Sister Bikini.Phoenix:\n(Maya and Bikini really seem excited about this training thing tonight...)Elise:\n...Well, Pearl? What are you going to do tonight?Pearl:\nWell, umm...Elise:\nIf you'd like, you can come to my room. Perhaps we can read some books together.Pearl:\nR-Really!? I'd love to! I, umm... I'm not very good at reading.Elise:\nHa ha ha. Well then, would you like to practice reading with me?Pearl:\nAh! I'd love to!Phoenix:\n(Pearls is absolutely smitten with Ms. Deauxnim...) So Larry, what are you going to do?Butz:\nHuh... Me? Um, well... I'm just gonna hang out in my room. I can't stand the cold at all.Phoenix:\n(I totally hear you there.)Pearl:\nUm, Ms. Elise? So, for example, how do you read this?Elise:\nIt says, \"gravely\"... That's kind of a tough word.Pearl:\nOh! OK! And what about this word?Elise:\nThat's another tough one. It says, \"roast\".Phoenix:\n(What kind of a book is she reading anyway...?)Pearl:\nWell, I'm going to go wash the dishes and help clean up. I'll go visit you when I'm done, Ms. Elise!Phoenix:\n(Well, not much to do except head to my room and huddle under the covers, I guess...)February 7, 9:12 PMHazakura TempleMain HallPhoenix:\n(Ugh... It's a whole different type of cold up here in the mountains! Argh... Why couldn't the nearest bathroom be just a little closer to my room...?)???:\n...Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nYaaaaaaah! Oh! Ah, Ms. Deauxnim! Are you going to use the bathroom, too?Elise:\nUm, no. But... Have you seen Pearl?Phoenix:\nNo... Not since after dinner. I thought she said she was going to go to your room...Elise:\nI know... But she never showed up. I-I'm going to go look for her. ...Excuse me.Phoenix:\n(Ms. Elise Deauxnim... A woman as mysterious in origin as her last name... But... The really mysterious one is...)Iris:\nOh...Phoenix:\nAh...! S-Sister Iris...!Iris:\nG... G-Good evening...Phoenix:\n(The real mysterious one is this girl...!)Iris:\nUm, are you on your way to the bathroom too, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n(...I can't let this chance pass me by! I should try to talk with her... And maybe get some answers.)Move\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n...It's freezing cold out there. And dark, too. There's nothing I need to do, so I think I'll just stay roasty-toasty in here.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... You're Sister Iris, right?\nIris:\n...Yes.\nPhoenix:\nS-So... um, when did you come to Hazakura Temple?\nIris:\n... I don't remember. Ever since I was a small child, the temple has been my home.\nPhoenix:\nSo you've never left?\nIris:\nWell, I don't have any family left to take care of me... Sister Bikini... I've come to think of her as my real mother, as it were.\nPhoenix:\nAh, I see... But you... Didn't you go to college? ...And maybe enroll with the Ivy University Literature Department?\nIris:\nNo, I never had an interest in going to a big university like that... My training is all the education I need.\nPhoenix:\nI... I see...\nIris:\nBut... Once in a while, when I get the chance, I make a trip to the nearby town. I can use a computer and a cell phone, too.\nPhoenix:\n... (That's not exactly something worth bragging about... But I don't see any Psyche-Locks... ...so I guess that means she's not lying...)\nIris:\nP-Please don't stare at me like that...\n\n\n\n\nHazakura Temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of a place is this anyway? I heard it's for training to increase your spiritual power or something like that.\nIris:\nIt must seem awfully crazy to normal people like you.\nPhoenix:\nWell, I have to admit it is a whole different world up here...\nIris:\nI'm glad to hear you say that.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nIris:\nTalking with dead people... Who does it help anyway? ...I hate it.\nPhoenix:\nR-Really? (So then why stay in a place like this...?)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Instead of showing her things, I really need to just listen to her story! This girl... Just who is she?)After clearing all Talk options:Iris:\nAh...Phoenix:\nIs something wrong?Iris:\nI-I didn't realize it was so late. I have to go and ring the bell for lights out...Phoenix:\n(I guess it's almost 10:00 now, huh?)Iris:\n... Um... Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n...Yes?Iris:\nIf it's alright with you... I would like you to have this.Phoenix:\nBut this is your hood...Iris:\nIt has the power to protect you from evil spirits.Phoenix:\n(Come to think of it, Sister Bikini was wearing one of these, too...)Iris:\nI pray for your safety on this dark, cold night.Iris's Hood received from Iris.Iris:\nI'm sorry, but I must bid you goodnight.Phoenix:\nWait a minute, Sister Iris...Iris:\nY-Yes...?Phoenix:\nJust now, you called me by my name... You said, \"Mr. Wright\". How did you know my name? I never introduced myself to you.Iris:\nTh-That's...Phoenix:\n...Sister Iris. Please, tell me the truth. You and I... Have we ever met before?Iris:\n...5 PSYCHE-LOCKSPhoenix:\nI-Iris...Iris:\nO-Oh! It-It's almost 10:00... Perhaps we can speak again... tomorrow.*gong* *gong* *gong*Phoenix:\n(So my hunch was correct... She does know me... I'll have to try to talk with her again tomorrow... ......... ...... ...)AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! (Changed from [YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!] in the original release)Phoenix:\n(Wh-What the...!? That blood-curdling scream came from the courtyard!)February 7, 11:06 PMHazakura TempleCourtyardPhoenix:\n(That scream... I'm sure it came from around here...) ...Aaaah! (S-Someone's there... On the ground...!) M-Ms. Deauxniiiiiim!...*squish*Phoenix:\n(...I just stepped on something soft.)Bikini:\nHey! Don't step on my tummy like that!Phoenix:\nWh-What are you doing lying there in the snow!?Bikini:\nI was passed out! What do you think!?Phoenix:\nSo that blood-curdling scream was you...?Bikini:\nF-Forget about that! H-Hurry up and call the police!Phoenix:\nIs there even a phone in the Main Hall?Bikini:\nNo, but we still get reception up here in the mountains! You must have a cell phone on you, right!?Phoenix:\nI, um... I didn't bring it with me--Bikini:\nOh, you're useless! I mean, even Iris has a cell phone... We've got no choice! You'll have to use the public phone by Dusky Bridge! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Run as fast as you can!Phoenix:\nY-Yes, ma'am...Bikini:\nIf you don't hurry, Iris will... Iris will...!February 7, 11:18 PMDusky BridgePhoenix:\n...*huff*...*huff*... (It's farther than I thought. The bridge is just up ahead. I have to go tell Maya what happened, too!) ............ ...Aaaaaaaaaah! Dusky Bridge...! It's burning down! (What the heck happened!?)Butz:\nWhat are you doing here?Phoenix:\nAaaaaaaaah!Butz:\nHuh? What is it? Is it me?Phoenix:\nD-Don't scare me like that, Larry! I almost had a heart attack!Butz:\nMy name isn't Larry! It's Laurice!Phoenix:\nLarry, hurry up and call the police! I'm going to the Inner Temple!Butz:\nD-Don't be stupid! The bridge is nothing but a burning wreck right now!Phoenix:\nListen to me! There's been a murder! Here! At Hazakura Temple!Butz:\nWha-Whaaaaat!?Phoenix:\nThe murderer might have fled across the bridge! I have to make sure Maya is safe!Butz:\nB-B-But...Phoenix:\nPlease! Call the police! I've got to go! ...Get outta my way, Larry!Butz:\nIt-It's too dangerous! Nick, w-wait!Phoenix:\n(I must have been crazy... I knew how dangerous it was, but I still went for it...)...*crack!*...Phoenix:\nAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!Butz:\nNiiiiiick----!Phoenix:\n(Weakened even more by the fire, the rickety old bridge's planks snapped and gave way. And as I was swallowed by the eternal darkness that surrounded me... ...a final, terrified scream rose up to pierce the frozen air of that harrowing night.)To be continued.Date: ???

It's an emergency!Edgeworth:\n...Huh? Larry...? Do you know what time it is?Butz:\nIt's not \"Larry\"! It's \"Laurice\"! Laurice Deauxnim!Edgeworth:\n(... This is nothing more than a terrible nightmare... I'll just roll over and...)Butz:\nW-Wait! Don't hang up! ...It's an emergency! It's Nick! H-He... He took a really nasty spill!Edgeworth:\nWell, it wouldn't be the first time, so...Butz:\nI'm not joking! His life is in danger!Edgeworth:\nWh-What...!? What happened!? Tell me!Butz:\nTalk about a guy with bad luck! He may already be dead! Anyway, you've got to come back! You're the only one that can help! My Iris... My beautiful Iris! She needs help...!Edgeworth:\nAlright. I don't know what's going on, but... I'll be there as soon as I can.Butz:\nI-I'm at the detention center! Please! Hurryyyyyy!Phone:\n...*beep*...Edgeworth:\n(It's been one year since I left that country... I thought I wouldn't have to see him again for a while... Sounds like it won't be a pretty reunion... As if I expected anything to change.)February 8, 2:19 PMDetention CenterVisitor's RoomButz:\nYou're late, Edgey! What took you so long!?Edgeworth:\nI don't want to hear it! I chartered a private jet to come as quickly as I could!Butz:\nWell, you should've chartered a faster one! Anyway, just listen! Something happened to Ms. Elise... and Nick is... Maya... and Iris's Bikini... ...Huh? Say something, Edgey!Edgeworth:\n...Before I came here, I stopped in at the hospital where Wright is. I believe I have a better understanding of the situation than you, at this point. The murder victim was the picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. She was found by Wright and the head nun. The suspect is the temple's younger nun. Then later, while Wright was crossing the bridge, it broke and he fell into the river. The hospital says that he'll need at least 2 days of bed rest.Butz:\nY-Yes! Th-That's right! You got it! B-But they arrested her... My sweet little Iris!Edgeworth:\n(And here I was, convinced HE was the one the police had arrested...) However... I still don't understand what these two items are for.Butz:\nWhat are you talking about?Edgeworth:\nThey're things Wright gave to me when I was leaving his room. (This is the first... He said some nonsense about being able to see into people's hearts with this... And the other... He couldn't possibly be asking what I think he is... could he?)Butz:\nI'm begging you! Iris's trial starts tomorrow! With Nick out of the picture, you're all I've got left! You're the only one that can represent her!Edgeworth:\n... What did you just say?Butz:\nYou know! REPRESENT! DEFEND! What were you expecting!? Why do you think I called you anyway!?Edgeworth:\n...I'm a prosecutor, Larry. A prosecutor. Do YOU understand what I'm saying? A prosecutor is a lawyer who...Butz:\nDon't talk to me like a kid! I graduated from junior high, you know! Don't worry about it! I promise I won't tell!Edgeworth:\nBut I...Butz:\nI mean, I heard a paper badge had no problem fooling an entire court before!Edgeworth:\n(...How could this country's judicial system have fallen into such decay!?)Butz:\nPlease, Edgey! At least listen to her... Listen to Iris's side of the story!Edgeworth:\n(So Wright wasn't joking when he gave me this badge after all...)Iris:\nThank you for coming. ...My name is Iris.Edgeworth:\n...Edgeworth. Miles Edgeworth. I don't know if I can be of any help, but... ...I will at least hear what you have to say. ...About the murder.Iris:\nUm...Edgeworth:\n...?Iris:\nM-Mr. Wright! H-H-How is he? Mr. Laurice said that he... That he might even die...Edgeworth:\n... Fortunately, he will be fine. (Larry, you moron! How could you say something like that!?) He was badly bruised when he hit the water, but otherwise he is unharmed.Iris:\n... Thank goodness...Edgeworth:\nBut, he's caught some kind of nasty cold.Iris:\nA cold...?Edgeworth:\nHe's running a high fever and is drifting in and out of consciousness.Iris:\n...Edgeworth:\n(I must be imagining things. This woman... I feel like I've met her before...)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurveillance camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe camera is glaring at me. \"If something glares at you, it's only polite to return the favor,\" is what I was taught. ...\nIris:\nUm... Is something bothering you?\nEdgeworth:\n...Hm? Oh, e-excuse me.\n\n\n\n\nGuard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe guard is glaring at me. \"If something glares at you, it's only polite to return the favor,\" is what I was taught. ...\nIris:\nUm... Are you alright, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n...Hm? Oh, e-excuse me.Move\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Going to a crime scene is akin to entering a jungle teeming with dangerous beasts. Before he goes there, a hunter needs to make sure he has plenty of ammunition. And in my case, that \nammunition is called, \"information\".Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nPardon me... Iris. I would like to ask you something, if you don't mind. I have the distinct feeling you and I have met before...\nIris:\nI-It must be your imagination, Mr. Edgeworth. After all... I hardly ever leave Hazakura Temple.\nEdgeworth:\nHazakura Temple? What's that?\nIris:\nIt's a place where those who wish to boost their spiritual power come to train. You need to undergo some very difficult training to release your inner spiritual power.\nEdgeworth:\nSpiritual power...? Did you go to that temple for that reason as well?\nIris:\nNo... I don't have any spiritual powers. I don't need them.\nEdgeworth:\nIn that case, what are you doing at that temple then?\nIris:\n... I... I've committed some sins. Sins that I need to pay for. That's why I'm there, and why I continue to train... To purify my soul.\n\n\n\n\nThe night of the crime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI want to ask you about last night... The night of the crime.\nIris:\nAlright... I helped to clean up after dinner, and then went back to my room at about 8:00. Later, I left my room to ring the lights out bell at 10:00.\nEdgeworth:\nBell...?\nIris:\n...We ring it at the same time each night.\nEdgeworth:\nI see... And then?\nIris:\nA-And then...\nEdgeworth:\n...?\nIris:\nI was told to go to the Training Hall, but... I went back to my room... and stayed there...\nEdgeworth:\nWhy didn't you go to the Training Hall like you were asked to?\nIris:\n...I-I was frightened.\nEdgeworth:\n(\"Frightened\"...?)\nIris:\nSo I just stayed in my room and meditated... until the murder happened.\nEdgeworth:\n(There's more to her story.  I just know there is. Maybe  I should dig a little deeper.)\n\n\n\n\nFrightened? (appears after \"The night of the crime\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou were asked to go to the Training Hall on the night of the murder?\nIris:\nYes...\nEdgeworth:\nHowever... You didn't go. Because you say you were frightened. What exactly were you so frightened of?\nIris:\n...!\n\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Wh-What in the world!?)\nIris:\nUm... Is there something wrong?\nEdgeworth:\n...I'm sorry. It's nothing. (It looks like she's not aware of them herself... These must be what Wright was talking about... The \"Psycholocks\"! I believe he said that I need to present this \"Magatama\" item to do something...)\nIris:\n...?\n\n\n\n\nFrightened? (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nI... I don't like to walk alone at night. And, last night was...\nEdgeworth:\nWhat about last night?\n\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n\nIris:\nEr, oh... nothing. It's rather silly...\nEdgeworth:\nSo there was something special about last night, hmm?\nIris:\nNngh...\nEdgeworth:\n(It looks like I have no choice but to break these locks...)\n\n\n\n\nAny idea? (before clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night?\nIris:\n...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed.\nEdgeworth:\nSpiritual power...?\nIris:\nYes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example...\nEdgeworth:\n...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science. I don't believe in \"spiritual power\".\nIris:\nYes... I understand. Most people don't.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd I am certain that the thing that killed the victim was a human. So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim?\nIris:\n... No. I'm not the one who took her life.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... (That was foolish of me... It's not as if I can know for certain if she is telling me the truth...)\n\n\n\n\nAny idea? (after clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night?\nIris:\n...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed.\nEdgeworth:\nSpiritual power...?\nIris:\nYes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example...\nEdgeworth:\n...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science. I don't believe in \"spiritual power\".\nIris:\nYes... I understand. Most people don't.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd I am certain that the thing that killed the victim was a human. So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim?\nIris:\n... No. I'm not the one who took her life.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... (Those Psycholock things aren't appearing... I suppose that means I can believe that she's not lying.) ...Heh.\nIris:\nWhat's wrong?\nEdgeworth:\n(I can't believe what I'm thinking... And here I just finished saying that I don't believe in spiritual power...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nIs that an attorney's badge?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, this belongs to Wright.\nIris:\nReally?\nEdgeworth:\nI'm actually a prosecutor.\nIris:\nOh...! Then why do you have a defense attorney's badge pinned on your lapel...?\nEdgeworth:\nWell, you see... I, um... I borrowed it.\n\n\n\n\nHanging Scroll\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWho is the woman on this hanging scroll?\nIris:\nWell, I don't know the details, but... I've heard she's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique.\nEdgeworth:\nM-Master?\nIris:\nYes. Mystic Misty. She was a great spirit medium. ...That's what I've heard. I also heard that she went missing over 15 years ago.\nEdgeworth:\n... Spirit mediums... There's no such thing anyway...\nIris:\nMr. Edgeworth...?\nEdgeworth:\nI know all about them... They're nothing but frauds!\nIris:\n...?\nEdgeworth:\n(She doesn't know anything about it, of course... But there was a time, 17 years ago, when I met the \"Master\" myself...)\n\n\n\n\nIris's Hood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nThat's called a \"Demon-Warding Hood\". ...I gave that to Mr. Wright last night.\nEdgeworth:\nHe was wearing this when I saw him at the hospital today.\nIris:\nIt's an important item for protecting acolytes from evil spirits.\nEdgeworth:\nIf it's so important, then why did you give it to him?\nIris:\nLast night... I felt... something... I felt that something terrible was about to happen... I... I didn't want Mr. Wright to fall into its grip.\nEdgeworth:\n(Well he wound up falling into something much deeper and colder... I probably shouldn't say that out loud, though. Thank god for inner monologue.)\n\n\n\n\n\"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\n...I was against the idea of our temple appearing in that magazine. I was afraid that... this type of a tragedy might occur.\nEdgeworth:\nIn that case, why did you allow them to run an article about you?\nIris:\nIt was Sister Bikini... She's actually rather fond of attention... Surprisingly so.\nEdgeworth:\n(She certainly does look rather happy in this photo...)\n\n\n\n\nPhoto of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nThat's Mystic Elise Deauxnim. She's a picture book author, or so I've heard.\nEdgeworth:\nDoes she come to Hazakura Temple often...?\nIris:\nNo... This was her first time. It's just that...\nEdgeworth:\n...?\nIris:\nShe was a very important visitor.\nEdgeworth:\nIs that so?\nIris:\nYes, Sister Bikini told me, \"Be certain not to offend her.\"\nEdgeworth:\n(The victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim... The prosecutor's office still doesn't have much information about her it seems...)\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix Wright profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nMr. Wright... How bad is his cold?\nEdgeworth:\nWell his fever is very high. As a result, he's rather confused. He's worried about Maya, who is still trapped in the Inner Temple... ...And he's quite worried about you as well, it seems.\nIris:\n...Really?\nEdgeworth:\nYes... Naturally, once he recovers, I'll pass the baton back to him.\nIris:\nNo... Don't... I'm sure that Mr. Wright wouldn't want that... He wouldn't want to defend me.\n\n\n\n\nLarry Butz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nOh... That's Mr. Laurice.\nEdgeworth:\n...I'm sorry? Who did you say it was?\nIris:\nLaurice Deauxnim. He is Mystic Elise's apprentice, I think.\nEdgeworth:\n(Alright... Now who exactly is this guy...?)\nIris:\nHe's a very sincere, hard-working person.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nIris:\nUm... Did I say something wrong, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nE-Excuse me. I was temporarily at a loss for words. (Take a trip... Come home... Be thrust suddenly into bizarro world...)\n\n\n\n\nIris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nYou want to know about me? There's not much to tell, I'm afraid.\nEdgeworth:\nJust let me get one thing straight. You were raised at Hazakura Temple, correct? And yet, somehow, you seem to know Wright.\nIris:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nSo you two must have crossed paths somewhere.\nIris:\n...No, Mr. Edgeworth. Whomever it was... ...it couldn't have been me.\nEdgeworth:\n(What is that supposed to mean?)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nI'm sorry... I don't leave the temple grounds very often... So I don't know very much about the outside world.After clearing all Talk options:Edgeworth:\nHmm... It appears that's about all that you can tell me.Iris:\nThank you very much for listening to my story.Edgeworth:\n...I visited Wright at the hospital before coming here. He asked me to take care of you...Iris:\n...M-Me?Edgeworth:\nYes, at the trial tomorrow... He asked me to defend you.Iris:\n... If Mr. Wright has that much faith in you, Mr. Edgeworth... ...Then I will gladly entrust my fate in your capable hands.Edgeworth:\nBut before that, I have one question.Iris:\nYes?Edgeworth:\nDo you know Wright?Iris:\nEr... Wh-Why would you ask that?Edgeworth:\nWhenever you came up in our conversation, he would begin to act a little... strange.Iris:\n... Mr. Edgeworth... What is Mr. Wright to you? (Changed from [Mr. Edgeworth... Are you his friend?] in the original release)Edgeworth:\n...He is a very dear and indispensable friend. (Changed from [Friend? Well... In a sense, yes.] in the original release)Iris:\n... It was 5 years ago... That's when I... That's when I... deceived him.Edgeworth:\nYou \"deceived\" him...?Iris:\nI heard that he was... in a lot of pain after what happened. I know what a weak person I am. That's why... That's why I thought it was best if he never saw me again. I wanted him to just forget about me, without learning the truth.Edgeworth:\n... Well, if you ask me, Wright is still suffering... And until he learns the truth, I don't think he will ever be able to truly recover. ...Iris. It's not too late. You should go to him. ...Tell him the truth.Iris:\n...Edgeworth:\nI'll defend you, but only if you agree to that one condition.Iris:\n... Alright, Mr. Edgeworth... I promise.Edgeworth:\n...Very well. I'll do everything in my power to get you an acquittal. (That's enough information gathering for now. I should head to the crime scene...)February 8Dusky BridgeEdgeworth:\n(It sure is cold alright... So this is it... Dusky Bridge...)???:\nOh, wow! It's you, Mr. Edgeworth! (Changed from [Ahem! M-Mr. Edgeworth!] in the original release)Edgeworth:\nNngh... Detective Gumshoe. (Changed from [Urk... Detective Gumshoe.] in the original release)Gumshoe:\nLong time no see! It's been about a year? ...Or has it been longer?Edgeworth:\nIt doesn't matter, Detective. What does matter is why you're shuffling around up here.Gumshoe:\nOh, ouch! ...And there's that sharp left jab! (Changed from [Oh, ouch! ...And there was a sharp left jab!] in the original release) Well, I'm happy to see you anyway, Mr. Edgeworth!Edgeworth:\nLet me guess... You were transferred by HR to the local precinct? (Changed from [Let me guess... You were transferred into another section at work.] in the original release) A wise decision. The vast amount of nothing up here should be quite easy to guard. (Changed from [A good choice. The vast amount of nothing up here must be quite easy to guard.] in the original release)Gumshoe:\nI heard you were back in the country and arranged to come all the way out here! Everybody was real nice. They even let me take charge of the investigation, sir.Edgeworth:\n(...Gumshoe indeed! Like gum on your shoe, he's impossible to get rid of!)Gumshoe:\nI'm supposed to report on the details of the crime scene, sir! Anyway! Here I am! Detective Dick Gumshoe! Reporting for duty!Edgeworth:\n...Great. Um, thank you, Detective.Gumshoe:\nI thought Prosecutor Godot was gonna get here before me. That guy's a real mystery, I tell you!Edgeworth:\n(...Prosecutor Godot?)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCliff on other side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt looks like a pretty good distance to that far cliff.\nGumshoe:\nYeah... It's gotta be around 100 yards or so.\nEdgeworth:\n... Detective... That's not even CLOSE to a hundred yards.\nGumshoe:\nWell... I gotta admit I'm not very good at judging distances.\nEdgeworth:\n(It's about 20 yards or so. And impossible to cross without a bridge, it seems...)\n\n\n\n\nWooden sign on left side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThere's a little shack down that way called, \"Heavenly Hall\".\nEdgeworth:\nA shack...?\nGumshoe:\nIt's like a run-down doghouse for losers that can't bear the freezing drafts of wind... Kinda reminds me of my apartment, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nThe name \"Heavenly Hall\" makes it sound like a palace...\nGumshoe:\nGiving a hovel a great name is a crime itself! I'd call it false advertising! By the way, the name of my apartment complex is \"Compton Castles\"...\nEdgeworth:\n...That's not such a great name, if you ask me.\nGumshoe:\nWell, it's not such a great apartment either, sir.\n\n\n\n\nBridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo this is the bridge Wright tried to cross?\nGumshoe:\nPretty reckless, if you ask me.\nEdgeworth:\nI'm amazed he survived the fall from up here...\nGumshoe:\nYeah, he's one lucky guy, sir. Now I see how he manages to win his cases in court. Blind luck.\nEdgeworth:\n(I think dumb luck suits Wright just a bit better.)\n\n\n\n\nBoulder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSome letters are wildly engraved into a roughly cut boulder. \"Dusky Bridge\"... It certainly is an appropriate name.\nGumshoe:\nYou need to get some glasses, Mr. Edgeworth! That sign says, \"Dusty Bridge\". I can see how you read it wrong, though, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nYou're the one who needs glasses, Detective. Try reading it one more time.\nGumshoe:\n... Ah! You're right! It's \"Dusky Bridge\" after all! ... I guess whoever wrote this made a mistake!\n\n\n\n\nPublic phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nHey! It's a public phone! You don't see a lot of these anymore!\nEdgeworth:\n...That's true.\nGumshoe:\nSince we've got one here, why don't we take a photo as a memento!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, um, sure. Why not?\nGumshoe:\nOh, darn it! I don't have a camera with me! ...I'm gonna go buy a disposable camera! I'll be right back, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n(What's so special about public phones, and why is he so fascinated by them...?)Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened (before visitng Main Hall)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case...\nGumshoe:\nIt's simple!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, simple is as simple does, as they say.\nGumshoe:\nOh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing!\nEdgeworth:\nA witness...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that Bikini lady.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Bikini lady\"? Here? On this freezing cold mountain?\nGumshoe:\n...Well, you should talk to her yourself if you want the details, sir.\nEdgeworth:\n(I may have to talk to this \"bikini lady\"... I mean, \"decisive witness\" myself...)\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened (after visitng Main Hall)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case...\nGumshoe:\nIt's simple!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, simple is as simple does, as they say.\nGumshoe:\nOh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing!\nEdgeworth:\nA witness...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that Bikini lady.\n\n\n\n\nDusky Bridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo this is the bridge that Wright fell through?\nGumshoe:\nYup! I can't imagine being that reckless myself... \"Look before you cross,\" is how it goes, right? Or was that \"leap\"...?\nEdgeworth:\nAnd? Is there something on the other side?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, some old building they call the Inner Temple... But we can't get over there without a bridge, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat...?\nGumshoe:\nNobody lives there, so it's usually not a problem... But someone was at the Inner Temple doing some training and now they're stuck there.\nEdgeworth:\nYes, I heard that from Wright. It's Maya Fey.\nGumshoe:\nOh no... Her again...? Anyway, the air's really turbulent right now so we can't do an aerial extraction. No one's gonna be able to reach the Inner Temple until tomorrow, sir.\nEdgeworth:\n(Will she be alright in this cold...?) So how did this bridge burn down anyway?\nGumshoe:\nWe're almost 100% sure it was lightning.\nEdgeworth:\n...Lightning?\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor Godot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo who is this Prosecutor Godot? I've never heard of him.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, he's a new guy... Showed up after you left the country! He's a complete rookie, but nobody can say a bad word about the guy.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat kind of a man is he?\nGumshoe:\nHe just became a prosecutor recently, but he's good, sir. Real good.\nEdgeworth:\n(If he's so good, how is it that I've never heard of him...?) Is he the lead prosecutor on this case?\nGumshoe:\nYou bet he is! After all, \"you know who\" is right in the middle of it.\nEdgeworth:\n\"You know who\"?\nGumshoe:\nPhoenix Wright, of course! For some reason, Godot has really got it in for Mr. Wright!\nEdgeworth:\nOh?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, he seems to have some kind of a grudge.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd what would be the cause of this grudge...?\nGumshoe:\nI dunno... Maybe he made fun of his mask or something.\nEdgeworth:\n(None of this is making any sense. I'd better look into this Godot myself.)\n\n\n\n\nLightning (appears after \"Dusky Bridge\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning?\nGumshoe:\nYup. Last night it snowed for the first time in 3 days. It's a little unusual for lightning to occur during a snow fall like that... But according to the weather data, lightning definitely struck.\nWeather Data added to the Court Record.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm, I see... This is a very detailed weather report... Almost too detailed... It even has the exact time that the lightning struck the bridge...\nGumshoe:\nOh, that? We got that information from the witness's testimony.\nEdgeworth:\nSomeone actually saw the lightning hit the bridge? Who is this witness?\nGumshoe:\n... Sorry. I'll go ask one of the local cops later, sir.\n\n\n\n\nLightning (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning?\nGumshoe:\nYup.

What's that thing doing on your lapel, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n...Is it really that odd?\nGumshoe:\nYou bet it is, sir! A prosecutor wearing a defense attorney's badge? That's like a detective with a license to kill!\nEdgeworth:\n(Does this little thing hold that ominous of a meaning...?)\n\n\n\n\nMagatama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHave you ever seen this thing before...?\nGumshoe:\nHey, thanks a lot. I was getting kind of hungry! ...*chomp!*\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What are you doing, Detective!?\nGumshoe:\nAck! ...I thought it was some kind of candy that would fill me up, sir. Lately I've been feeling so hungry all the time...\nEdgeworth:\n(Nngh... Maybe his salary has been cut just a little too much...?)\n\n\n\n\nPhoto of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThere's a lot we don't know about this victim... We don't know her real name, her background... We don't know anything really.\nEdgeworth:\nThat's rather odd... If she was trying to hide her identity, why would she become an author?\nGumshoe:\nI'll bet it was just one of those things. You know... She probably never expected to get so popular.\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix Wright profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nWhenever something happens, this guy always shows up like he hasn't got a care. In fact, you know what...? Every time he shows up, I always wonder the same thing. \"Maybe somehow he's actually the cause of all these incidents!\"\nEdgeworth:\n(I wonder if Gumshoe has realized it yet... But you could say the exact the same thing about him!)\n\n\n\n\nDick Gumshoe profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYour face is more drawn out than the last time I saw you over a year ago.\nGumshoe:\nR-Really? I thought so!\nEdgeworth:\nNo, wait... It's not so much \"drawn out\", as \"weary and tired\", or maybe just plain old \"thin\".\nGumshoe:\nI thought that too, sir. My salary's been kinda on the low end... So yeah, my food options have been kinda non-existent. Off-brand chicken soup, off-brand spaghetti, off-brand bread... That sort of stuff.\nEdgeworth:\nI thought you were really into instant noodles last year...?\nGumshoe:\n...I got really sick of the stuff after a while, sir.\n\n\n\n\nLarry Butz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nHe's supposed to be Ms. Elise Deauxnim's apprentice or something.\nEdgeworth:\n...I see.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, he drew a nice portrait of me.\nEdgeworth:\n...That's nice.\nGumshoe:\nBut he made me pay him 50 cents for it.\nEdgeworth:\n...I'm sorry about that.\nGumshoe:\n... You don't seem very interested in him, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\n...I really don't want to talk about him. That's why.\n\n\n\n\nIris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI feel like I've seen this girl somewhere before! She wasn't from a prior case, was she?\nGumshoe:\nNope, can't be. We did a database search with her fingerprints and came up with nothing.\nEdgeworth:\nI see... (I just can't shake this nagging feeling...)\nGumshoe:\nWell, everyone knows that you are quite popular with the ladies, sir... Maybe she's an old girlfriend that you sent to Dumpsville when you were younger.\nEdgeworth:\nD-Detective! Where did you hear such nonsense from!?\nGumshoe:\nI didn't hear it from anyone. It's just sorta how I imagine you to be... sir.\nEdgeworth:\n(...D-Do I really inspire this sort of frothing desire from the female masses?)\n\n\n\n\nGodot profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI usually hear about promising young prosecutor candidates while they're still in school. But I've never seen or heard of this person.\nGumshoe:\nI gotta admit... He's puzzling alright. He just appeared one day, big mug of steaming coffee in his hand...\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... He sounds like an interesting man...\nGumshoe:\nYeah... The whole prosecutor's office is really into double espresso macchiatos lately.\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nLook, I'm just your everyday, simple detective. Don't ask me such tough questions, OK?\nEdgeworth:\n...That's not something to be proud of, Detective!February 8Detention CenterVisitor's RoomEdgeworth:\n(It looks like Iris is being interrogated right now.) ...This place certainly brings back memories.Gumshoe:\nOh yeah. Come to think of it, you got thrown in here once too, didn't you, sir? But you know what? I've never been in jail a single time!Edgeworth:\n(I should think it's hard to land in jail when you're so harmless...) Yes, well... If you're in jail, you don't have to pay for your own meals, you know.Gumshoe:\n...*gasp!* ...Edgeworth:\nDon't get any funny ideas, Detective...!Gumshoe:\n...Too late, I already did.Edgeworth:\n(In any case... I guess I'll have to come back here later...)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurveillance camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThat camera is meant to monitor everything that happens in here. And right now, it's pointed straight at the guard.\n\n\n\n\nGuard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe guard is staring at me with a puzzled expression on his face. Me... and the badge on my lapel. ...I get the feeling he recognizes me.February 8Hazakura TempleMain GateButz:\nYo! Edgey! What took you so long!? I'm so cold, my brain's turned to sherbet.Edgeworth:\n...I knew it was a mistake to race back to this country.Butz:\nWh-What do you mean...?Edgeworth:\nWright is going to be fine, and the case itself isn't anything unusual... And I find myself taking a request to defend a woman accused of murder!Gumshoe:\n...H-Hey! Wait a sec! Hold it! Objection! What's going on here, Mr. Edgeworth!?Edgeworth:\nUm, it's hard to explain, but one thing led to another and...Butz:\nWhat kind of lame excuse is that!? And you call yourself a defense attorney!?Gumshoe:\nProsecutor Edgeworth is a prosecutor, and that's why he's Prosecutor Edgeworth! \"Prosecutor Edgeworth, Defense Attorney\" just sounds plain old weird, pal! ...Right, Prosecutor Edgeworth!?Edgeworth:\n(...I'm not sure what role I'm supposed to be playing anymore.)Butz:\nHmph! Dude, Edgey... (Changed from [Hmph! Dude, Edgey... I don't see you for a couple of years...] in the original release) I don't see you for a couple of years, and your heart turns to sherbet!

I just know it, OK!? So trust me on this one!Edgeworth:\nEver the romantic, aren't you, Larry? Nevertheless, I'll do whatever I can to prove her innocence. (At least until I pass the baton on to Wright, that is.)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis gate looks quite old; strong enough to resist the weight of time.\nGumshoe:\nThat's the Mr. Edgeworth I know! You got a real flair for words, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nI have always appreciated this kind of old, timeless elegance.\nGumshoe:\nThat's exactly how I feel, too! Take this coat for example! Like a fine wine, it gets better with age!\nEdgeworth:\nEven fine wine turns to vinegar and begins to stink at some point. ...I suggest you wash that atrocious rag you call a coat, Detective.\n\n\n\n\nMain Hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThat must be the Main Hall back there.\nGumshoe:\nA brilliant deduction, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n............ Are you trying to flatter me, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nUmm...

I can't miss the opportunity to speak with her...)\n\n\n\n\nBell tower\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI can see a small bell tower from here.\nGumshoe:\nHey, that just reminded me! There's something I've always wondered about...\nEdgeworth:\n(Something tells me he's going to tell me what's on his mind, whether I like it or not...)\nGumshoe:\nWe call a person who tells a lie a \"liar\", right? So why don't we call a person who rings a bell a \"beller\"? Or \"truer\" for a guy who tells the truth!

It might even make me rich!\nEdgeworth:\nAn invention...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah! A car that can travel on snow! I'll call it a \"Snow Car\"!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nGumshoe:\nSo what do you think, sir? Would you go for a ride on something like that?\nEdgeworth:\n...Only after you take the first 1000 test rides.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nMan, I'm telling you. Iris is so cute! Right, Edgey? You think so too, don't you?\nEdgeworth:\n...\nButz:\nWhat's wrong? Why are you so quiet?\nEdgeworth:\nTo put it simply...Your comment has me highly concerned. Could it be that the reason you think she's innocent...\nButz:\nCome on! A girl that cute can't possibly be a murderer!\nEdgeworth:\n... ...I was right after all. I should never have come back.\nButz:\nNo, no! Don't worry! I see things for how they really are this time! Honest!\nEdgeworth:\n(If I had a penny for every time he's said that...)\nButz:\nIt's just that... Well, Iris is a delicate flower. You can't force things too much.

Someone's pinning this murder on my sweet little Iris! Edgey! Please! I'm counting on you!\nEdgeworth:\nWell... Frankly, I was hoping you could give me a little more than that.\nButz:\n...Errr. Well then... I got it! I'll draw you a portrait! How about that!?\nEdgeworth:\n... Since you're kind enough to offer... alright.\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix Wright profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nHe was a good guy... A real pal to the end. When I look back now, I have nothing but good memories.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat's with the past tense? He's not dead, you know!\nButz:\nYeah, you're right. Anyway, the guy owes me. After all, I saved his life.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is that supposed to mean?\nButz:\nIf I hadn't called for help so quickly, he would have died. It's no surprise though. I used to be a security guard. It was all instinct, baby!\nEdgeworth:\n(He has a point... He called me pretty quickly, too... I think Larry's pretty good at motivating people. I just wish he would try motivating himself once in a while!)\n\n\n\n\nLarry Butz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nHuh? Me? All you have to know is to remember not to call me \"Larry\" anymore.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat...?\nButz:\nI'm a new person now. I've been reborn... as Laurice Deauxnim!\nEdgeworth:\n... Alright, fine. Let me ask you something else then, Larry.\nButz:\nCall me \"Laurice\"!! If you don't... ...then I'll call you... I'll call you... \"Milise Deauxnim\"!\n\n\n\n\nIris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI have a feeling that she's hiding something...\nButz:\nCould be... After all, she's shy and gets embarrassed pretty easily.\nEdgeworth:\n...I don't think that has anything to do with it.\nButz:\nWhy not? Look, I know all about this kind of thing. C'mon Edgey... You were a guy once! Lots of girls are like Iris. You know I'm right!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, you most certainly seem to have convinced yourself!\nButz:\nMan, I love shy girls like her! It-It's just so... cute! You know what I mean?\nEdgeworth:\n(Still doesn't listen to others, I see... I guess some people just never change.)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nHey, I know I may not look like it, but I'm an artist. I refuse to look at anything that doesn't have a radiant or beautiful motif.\nEdgeworth:\n(...He didn't even give it a glance.)February 8Hazakura TempleMain HallBikini:\n*sigh*Gumshoe:\nHey! Hello there! Um, so how are you feeling?Bikini:\nAlright, I suppose. ...Huh? Who is this?Edgeworth:\nI... My name is... Miles Edgeworth.Bikini:\nMy my my. A handsome boy such as yourself is always welcome! *sigh* If circumstances weren't so tragic, I might just...Edgeworth:\n(Please don't call me \"boy\".) I'm sorry to trouble you... But I'm looking for a woman in a bikini.Bikini:\nWell, you have found her. Now, what can I do for you?Edgeworth:\n... I'm sorry, but I don't see any bikinis...Bikini:\nHa ha ha! If you ask nicely, I might give you a peek, big boy. Wa ha ha ho ho ho!Gumshoe:\nUmm... Mr. Edgeworth? This is the head nun, Sister Bikini... She's the witness.Edgeworth:\n... Why didn't you tell me that earlier!? This is exactly why your salary keeps on getting cut!Gumshoe:\nNngh... My stomach is already growling in protest...Bikini:\nSo... Um... What's the latest about my beloved Iris!?Edgeworth:\nWell, first... I want to hear what you know.Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWalls or sliding doors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere's flowing script written everywhere on the walls.\nGumshoe:\nMan, I'd bet you'd have awful nightmares if you tried to sleep in here.\nBikini:\nThis is our Main Hall, so it's protected by a variety of magic spells and charms... They're all designed to prevent evil forces from entering.\nGumshoe:\nSo if I slept here the uggie-woogie-boogieman wouldn't hunt me down for eternity? Alright!\nEdgeworth:\n(Does this guy think about anything other than eating and sleeping...?)\n\n\n\n\nObjects on floor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nOh! It's a warmed cat box! But where are all the cats?\nEdgeworth:\n...It's called a \"hibachi\". It's for heating the room.\nGumshoe:\nOh! Look at all these ancient straw frisbees!\nEdgeworth:\nThose are a type of \"zabuton\" cushions called \"enza\"!\nGumshoe:\n... Why are you giving me such a hard time? Huh, Mr. Edgeworth? Why?\nEdgeworth:\nBecause learning something new might actually be a good thing for you, Detective!\n\n\n\n\nAltar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt's an altar with a giant Magatama enshrined on it.\nGumshoe:\nThere are lots of candles lined up on it, too. You know... I haven't had a birthday party for myself in a while...\nEdgeworth:\nMaybe you should blow out those candles over there to make up for that.\nGumshoe:\nMr. Edgeworth? Would you mind singing \"Happy Birthday\" to me?\nBikini:\nS-Stop that! Cut that out! Please don't blow out the altar candles!\n\n\n\n\nMagatama on altar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...That thing sure casts a strong presence over the whole room.\nBikini:\nThis is the \"Lesser Magatama\". It's a precious heirloom containing a great many souls.\nGumshoe:\nHuh...!? This is \"lesser\"!? What is the \"greater\" one like?\nBikini:\nThe \"Greater Magatama\" is displayed in the Main Room of Fey Manor. It was supposed to be shown at the Treasures of Kurain exhibit... But, it was so large that they couldn't bring it through the doors.\n\n\n\n\nLeft corner near altar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(There are more enza cushions in the corner of the room.) ...What's that white piece of paper sticking out from under that stack...?\nGumshoe:\nHmm... Beats me.\nEdgeworth:\nWould you mind checking that for me, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir! Here you are, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nIt looks like an old manila envelope...\nGumshoe:\nEeeeeeeeeeaaaah!!\nEdgeworth:\n...What is it, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nTh-This... This could be it! An ultra important clue! A super-special clue!\nEdgeworth:\n...I suppose I should read it myself then.\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like a letter addressed to Sister Iris. \"tonight at 10 at Heavenly Hall. ... ...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed.\"\nEdgeworth:\nTh-This sounds like a blackmail letter...!\nNote to Iris added to the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\nNice going there, Mr. Edgeworth! Why can't I ever find clues like that!? You're an ultra-important prosecutor!! A super-duper prosecutor!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, I suppose it takes a super-duper kind of dumb to miss a clue like this.\n\n\n\n\nLeft corner near altar (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(There are more enza cushions in the corner of the room.)\nGumshoe:\nNice going there, Mr. Edgeworth!

A super-duper prosecutor!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, I suppose it takes a super-duper kind of dumb to miss a clue like this.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe night of the crime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nFirst, I'd like to ask you about last night.\nBikini:\nWell, last night... we had an acolyte here for training. After dinner, the two of us went to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple.\nEdgeworth:\n(She must be talking about Maya...) Approximately what time was that...?\nBikini:\nI suppose it was about 9:00 when we left here. Training lasts all night long. It's extremely exhausting. The channeling dojo's Head Nun must be in attendance at all times to keep watch.\nGumshoe:\nWow, you're right! That does sound exhausting!\nEdgeworth:\nDetective, this is no time for flattery.\nGumshoe:\nSorry.\nEdgeworth:\nSome time around 11:00, you witnessed the incident in the courtyard. But your duty was in the Inner Temple. Why did you come back here?\nBikini:\nHmm... The way you're staring at me, I'm starting to get goosebumps! Ha ha ha ho ho!\nEdgeworth:\n(Nngh... I'm starting to get goosebumps myself, but for a decidedly different reason.)\nGumshoe:\nHo ho, you get the chills pretty easy, don't you Mr. Edgeworth?\n\n\n\n\nWhat you saw\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAlright then... I'd like you to tell me exactly what you saw in the courtyard.\nBikini:\nIt must have been past 11:00. Ah! No! I can't say it! It-It's too much for my poor heart!\nGumshoe:\nHey! Calm down, lady! L-Let go of my tie!\nBikini:\n...I saw two people! One of them was lying on the ground... Th-The other one was stabbing her from the back... with a sword!\nEdgeworth:\nDid you see this criminal with your own eyes?\nBikini:\nI didn't want to believe what I was seeing...! ...But it was Iris!\nEdgeworth:\nYou must have been quite shocked.\nGumshoe:\nOf course she was! Try putting yourself in her shoes! It'd be like if you were stabbing Mr. Wright smack in the middle of a courtroom! And I happened to witness it from the witness stand! ...I'd be pretty shocked too.\nBikini:\nI know it sounds insane... But that's what I saw. And when I finally realized what I was seeing, I screamed, and then... I passed out.\nEdgeworth:\n(...Unfortunately for us, her testimony seems to be pretty solid.)\nBikini:\nHowever... The idea of Iris doing such a foul act seems... unnatural.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Unnatural\"...?\nBikini:\nThe girl I know simply isn't capable of this sort of foulness...\nEdgeworth:\n(...I wonder what she means by that?)\n\n\n\n\nWhy return? (appears after \"The night of the crime\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAs the head nun, it's your duty to stay with the acolyte at all times, correct?\nBikini:\nYes, that's correct. I know I may look strong, but the truth is... I've got a bad lower back.\nEdgeworth:\nA bad lower back...?\nBikini:\nYes, it's especially bad in the winter. So bad that I can't even lift a bucket. Do you remember how cold it was last night? My bad back felt as stiff as frozen glass. I just wanted to take a nice hot bath to ease my aching back... That's why I returned to the Main Hall.\nEdgeworth:\nSo you left the disciple all alone?\nBikini:\nDon't be ridiculous! I would never do that! That's why I ordered Iris to the Inner Temple after she had rung the bell for lights out.\nEdgeworth:\n(Yes, but she never went to the Inner Temple, did she? So did this head nun actually see Iris there? (Changed from [Did this head nun even see Iris?] in the original release) I think I'd better try to get some more details...)\n\n\n\n\nThe acolyte (appears after \"What you saw\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo who is this acolyte that was to train at the Inner Temple...?\nBikini:\nHer name is Maya Fey... I treated her very badly, I'm ashamed to say. And after she went through the trouble of signing up for the Special Course...\nGumshoe:\n\"Special Course\"?\nBikini:\nIt's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant 30,000 times...\nEdgeworth:\nYou don't mean to tell me she's still doing that over at the Inner Temple, do you?\nBikini:\nNo, no, no. Of course not! You don't have to worry about that one little bit. Last night, we still hadn't started the training session itself.\nEdgeworth:\nWell, um... That's good to hear.\nBikini:\n...Oh! Dear, dear! There's one thing I forgot to tell you.\nGumshoe:\n...Uh-oh, I don't think I like the sound of this.\nBikini:\nDo you know that small girl? I believe she is Mystic Maya's little sister.\nEdgeworth:\n(Maya has a little sister...?)\nGumshoe:\nOh, you mean little Pearl! That's Maya Fey's cousin.\nEdgeworth:\nLittle... Pearl...?\nBikini:\nI thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after we'd finished with dinner cleanup... (Changed from [I thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after cleaning up dinner...] in the original release) But I haven't seen her at all since late last night! She's nowhere to be found!\nEdgeworth:\nY-You mean she...!? She was with the victim!?\nBikini:\nIt's all the fault of my stupid, creaky old back!\nEdgeworth:\n(A little girl who was with the victim on the night of the murder... is gone!)\nGumshoe:\nAs they say... \"The plot thickens!\"Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagatama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nTh-That's...! That's one of the Fey clan's very own Magatamas! That's a priceless treasure you've got there!\nGumshoe:\nW...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me!\nBikini:\nYes... You don't look it, but now I can see you're a real fan of the occult!\nEdgeworth:\nExcuse me?\nBikini:\nOh, of course this piece couldn't possibly be real, but to have such a nice replica... Clearly, you are a big fan of the Kurain Tradition!\nGumshoe:\nW...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me!\nEdgeworth:\n(I should have known better than to show this thing around...)\n\n\n\n\nHanging Scroll\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nHuh... Ahh! Well, well, well... Look what you've found! That's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, Mystic Misty Fey!\nEdgeworth:\n\"Fey\"...\nBikini:\nIt's been nearly 20 years since Mystic Misty's disappearance. Apparently, she intended to pass on the Master title to her daughter.\nEdgeworth:\nWho is this daughter?\nBikini:\nWell, I myself am part of a branch family of the Fey clan. But even I am not privy to information concerning the main family...\n\n\n\n\nIris's Hood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nWell, well, well! That's a Demon-Warding Hood! Acolytes are highly susceptible to possession by evil spirits, you know. That's why we always wear these for protection.\nEdgeworth:\nOh, I see...\nBikini:\nWhat are you waiting for? You won't get any protection just by holding it, you know! Put it on already!\nEdgeworth:\nNo! I can't...! I was just...!\nBikini:\n... Ha ha ha ho ho ho!\nGumshoe:\nHo ho ho! It's like it was made just for you, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean by that, Detective!?\nBikini:\nIt looks absolutely marvelous! You've just got to keep it on for a while!\nEdgeworth:\n(Is this some sort of divine retribution...?)\n\n\n\n\n\"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAbout this picture...\nBikini:\nWell look at that! I look pretty s-to-the-exy, don't you think!?\nGumshoe:\nUm, ah... Y-Yeah. Absolutely.\nBikini:\nUp until recently, we've avoided exposure in such magazines. But this time we had our reasons...\nEdgeworth:\nIs that so? For exampl--?\nBikini:\nHa ha ha ha ha!!! Well, why deny the world the sight of such a lovely face!?\n\n\n\n\nPhoto of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\n...Ohhhh! H-How could such a... terrible thing have happened...? It's all... It's all... It's all my fault!\nGumshoe:\nWell come on, lady... I don't think you need to take all the blame yourself.\nBikini:\nQuiet! What do you know anyway!?\nGumshoe:\n...Ouch. You're scary!\nBikini:\nWith that stupid 5 o'clock shadow and that stupid old coat of yours... It's too bad that you weren't the one that disappeared!\nGumshoe:\n... ...Why does she have to take it all out on me?\nEdgeworth:\n(Her anger does seem a little... manufactured.)\n\n\n\n\nNote to Iris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nDo you know anything about this old, crumpled-up letter?\nBikini:\n... Is that addressed to Iris?\nGumshoe:\nYup, it clearly says \"To Iris\" on it.\nBikini:\nI can't believe it... That girl doesn't have any secrets from me...\nEdgeworth:\n(Ah... So Sister Bikini didn't know anything about it...)\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix Wright profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nThis man... His face betrays a life of suffering and great weariness of the world.\nEdgeworth:\n...Um, sure.\nBikini:\nBut even so... I can't believe this guy actually jumped into the river! Think of all the fun things he might have enjoyed if he had just lived... Relentless spiritual training alone is no way to lead a complete life, huh...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n(It sounds like she's got some major regrets she's dealing with... Hmm... Perhaps I should let Gumshoe explain Wright's situation to her for me...)\nGumshoe:\nH-Hey! Don't look at me like that! Do you own dirty work! ...Sir!\n\n\n\n\nLarry Butz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nThis is Mystic Elise's apprentice, is it not? I think he might have a bit of a crush on me... Sweet boy at any rate.\nGumshoe:\nHuh?\nBikini:\nOh, I don't blame him. Sister Bikini understands the temptations of young men.\nEdgeworth:\n...Sure.\nBikini:\nBut I'm afraid it wouldn't be proper to abuse my position. I am head nun, after all. But, in return, I did allow him to draw a portrait of me.\nEdgeworth:\n(I pray it was a pose that maintained your modesty. For everyone's sake...)\n\n\n\n\nIris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou said you went with Maya to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple last night. Did you happen to see Iris while you were there?\nBikini:\nOf course I saw her. I told her to meet us after ringing the 10:00 bell for lights out.\nGumshoe:\nSo you're saying Iris came to the Inner Temple then?\nBikini:\nOf course she did. Iris has always been a good, obedient girl. After that, I had Maya begin her training ceremony.\nEdgeworth:\n(But that doesn't fit with Iris's story at all... She said that she never went to the Inner Temple!)\nGumshoe:\nAs they say... \"The plot thickens!\"\n\n\n\n\nBikini profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nIt's all my fault... Me and my stupid back! Mystic Elise has been murdered, an important acolyte is trapped... ...and a little girl has been lost!\nGumshoe:\nYou know you really shouldn't be so negative. It creates bad karma...\nBikini:\n...Quite right. I need to do some more training myself, I think...\n\n\n\n\nMaya Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nShe's a very important visitor, you know! An honored acolyte!\nEdgeworth:\n\"Honored\"? How so?\nBikini:\nThe Fey name is synonymous with the Kurain Channeling Technique. Therefore, she must be a spirit medium of great power indeed.\nGumshoe:\nNow that you mention it, one year ago... ...there was a case that was about the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique!\nEdgeworth:\n...Detective. I detest talk of supernatural drivel. I suppose now you'll say she has midi-chlorians?\nGumshoe:\nHo ho ho. So it gives you the creeps, huh, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n(...That's got nothing to do with it.)\n\n\n\n\nPearl Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nOh, this poor girl... Where could she have gone...?\nGumshoe:\nWell, we checked out her home and she's not there.\nBikini:\nAnd she's nowhere in the vicinity of the temple either...\nEdgeworth:\n(Which means... ...there's only a few other possibilities as to where she could be.)\nGumshoe:\nAh! Do you think maybe she fell off the bridge and was carried downstream...!?\nEdgeworth:\n... Why do you have to be such a pessimist, Detective!?\nGumshoe:\nNngh... I was just trying to think like you, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\n(Ironic. I became a pessimist only after I had the pleasure of working with you!)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nUmm, about this here...\nBikini:\nHmm... Let me see... Well, as you may know... In order to see reality for what it truly is... ...we strive to break our attachments to much of the transient, material realm. I guess you could call me an \"immaterial girl\"!\nGumshoe:\nI guess she lives in an immaterial world, huh Mr. Edgeworth?Main Gate (before clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nI'm just no good with people like her.

Gotta make sure I don't leak the prosecution's whole investigation...Edgeworth:\nDon't worry about it, Detective.

I jumped over a few of those in my time. ... Most of them are good memories, but not all.\nEdgeworth:\nDetective... Perhaps someone should introduce you to the concept of paucity of words...\n\n\n\n\nTop right corner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe Main Hall of Hazakura Temple is above us here.\nGumshoe:\nHey... You're right! But I'm pretty sure the Main Hall didn't have a 2nd floor.\nEdgeworth:\nHazakura Temple was built on a steep part of the mountain. The front and back of the Main Hall are on different levels.\nGumshoe:\nOh... That makes sense... But wouldn't it be easier just to build the place slanted, sir?\nEdgeworth:\n(I fail to see how he can consider that to be an even remotely good idea.)\n\n\n\n\nSkis, ski poles, or sled\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nAh! I just love skiing!\nEdgeworth:\nReally? You don't um... seem like the type. Well, what about sleds?\nGumshoe:\nSleds? Nah. They're a little too kiddy, you know?

Her entire past, up until she won that writing award last year, is a total mystery.\nEdgeworth:\nIt's hard to believe in this day and age you can still find people like that.\nGumshoe:\nThe estimated time of death of the victim was between 10:00 and 11:00 PM on Feb. 7th. Cause of death was blood loss resulting from a stab to the back by the murder weapon.\nEdgeworth:\nThe murder weapon...?\nGumshoe:\nThe victim was found skewered with a giant sword, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nTh-That's terrible...\nGumshoe:\nYeah, but there's one strange thing.\nEdgeworth:\n...Yes?\nGumshoe:\nThe victim's entire body was covered with bruises. The bruises are consistent with falling from the height of a two-story building.\nEdgeworth:\nA two-story building...? That would be about the same height as that room in front of us, correct?\nGumshoe:\nHey, you're right. Way to go, Mr. Edgeworth! That just happens to be the room that Elise Deauxnim was staying in!\nEdgeworth:\n(Maybe she was pushed out of the window after she was stabbed by the sword?)\nElise's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.

Let's see if we can summarize what we've learned so far.\nGumshoe:\nOK! Let's take a look at the map. ...According to the testimony of Sister Bikini, the head nun... ...right after they'd finished dinner, she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple. (Changed from [...she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple right after dinner was finished.] in the original release) At 10 PM, after ringing the bell for lights out, Iris went to the Inner Temple. When she got there, Bikini had her take over while she went back to Hazakura Temple. After taking a hot bath to soothe her back... ...Sister Bikini witnessed the murder in the courtyard! If you want more details, you should ask Bikini herself in the Main Hall.\nEdgeworth:\n(The Inner Temple, huh...? I'd like some more information about that place...)\n\n\n\n\nTomorrow's trial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe trial begins tomorrow, but who's the prosecutor?\nGumshoe:\nI'm pretty sure it's that Godot guy, but... ...nobody can get a hold of him, so they're looking for a replacement.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean...?\nGumshoe:\nIt's really weird. All of a sudden, no one can reach him! Hmm, I wonder if the rumors are true. Maybe since Mr. Wright caught a cold and won't be defending, he just lost interest.\nEdgeworth:\nI intend to appear in court in the role of defense lawyer. However... I would be quite unhappy if it came out that I'm actually a prosecutor.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, I can see why. But I'm not the one you have to worry about... I think the real problem is gonna be that judge...\nEdgeworth:\n...Yes, he certainly would remember my face, even after such a long absence. That's why I requested another judge preside over the case. We've only met each other once. There's a good chance he won't remember me at all.\nGumshoe:\nY-Yeah, but... what about the prosecutor? Everyone in the prosecutor's office must know you! Wouldn't it be a problem if someone there made a big stink, sir?\nEdgeworth:\nThere's no need to worry. I pulled a few strings and arranged for a prosecutor of my own choosing.\nGumshoe:\nWow, Mr. Edgeworth... I had no idea you had such a powerful string to pull!\n\n\n\n\nInner Temple (appears after \"What happened\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this Inner Temple that Maya was supposedly training at...?\nGumshoe:\nAccording to Bikini, it's an old building they use for training the acolytes. It's on the other side of Dusky Bridge.\nEdgeworth:\n(The bridge that burned down, huh...) Is there anything else on the other side of that bridge besides the Inner Temple?\nGumshoe:\nNope, not a thing.\nEdgeworth:\nNothing?\nGumshoe:\nThe other side is surrounded by cliffs on all sides... In a way, it's kinda like a little island out there.\nEdgeworth:\n(So the only thing there is the Inner Temple...)\nGumshoe:\nI hear it's not the kind of place a person could survive in.\nEdgeworth:\n(Please be alright, Maya...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictim's Staff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nOh, so I think I might have already told you about this, but... The truth is... When I was a little kid...\nEdgeworth:\nYou wanted to become a wizard, right?\nGumshoe:\nHey, that's amazing! How did you know that!? So? What do you think? I'd make a really great one, don't you think?\nEdgeworth:\nWe just had this conversation a little while ago, Detective!\n\n\n\n\nShichishito\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThis sword represents the multiple branches that life can take, all ending as one.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... I've never heard that one.\nGumshoe:\nYou know what I think about sometimes? What kind of life would I have had if I hadn't joined the Homicide Division.\nEdgeworth:\n...So you think about that kind of thing too, huh?\nGumshoe:\nOf course I do. I think about it a lot. Me as a traffic cop. Me as a detention officer. Me as the Blue Badger...\nEdgeworth:\n(...I guess he doesn't have any plans to leave the force.)\n\n\n\n\nBikini profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThis is the witness who saw the crime take place out there in the temple courtyard. I'm pretty sure it's gonna be her testimony that'll be key to this case, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nSo you mean she's going to be a witness in the trial tomorrow...?\nGumshoe:\nOf course! A nun is as trustworthy as you can get! We got this one in the bag! ... Oh. I-I mean, I've always been on your side, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! So yeah, this is a pretty tight spot we've gotten ourselves into, huh!?\nEdgeworth:\n(Now I understand why Wright is always breaking into a cold sweat...)\n\n\n\n\nMaya Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI wonder if Maya is alright? I could never show my face to Wright again if something were to happen to her.\nGumshoe:\nAww, it'll be OK. If that ever happens, you can just show him my face. How's that...?\nEdgeworth:\n...\nGumshoe:\nAck! Um, I didn't mean it like that, sir! It was just a silly little joke!\nEdgeworth:\nI wonder if there is another way to get across to the other side? The support wires for the bridge are still intact, correct?\nGumshoe:\nThat bridge is almost 20 yards long... I know I may look like it, Mr. Edgeworth, but I'm no super hero.\nEdgeworth:\n(In any case, I just hope Maya is alright...)\n\n\n\n\nPearl Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat about Pearl...? Has no one seen her at all since last night?\nGumshoe:\nSeems that way... Apparently, she hasn't gone back to Kurain Village either, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nBut it's true that she was with Elise Deauxnim at some point last night?\nGumshoe:\nNo doubt about it. Ah...! Y-You mean that maybe whoever killed Ms. Deauxnim also...!?\nEdgeworth:\nD-Don't jump to any crazy conclusions!\nGumshoe:\nOooooouuuch! ...You sure have one mean punch, Mr. Edgeworth! It's down-right fierce!After clearing all Talk options in Dusky Bridge, clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate, clearing all Talk options and examining left corner near altar in Hazakura Temple - Main Hall, and clearing all Talk options and examining staff and Ami Fey statue in Hazakura Temple - Courtyard:February 8Detention CenterVisitor's RoomIris:\nAh...

Where is it on this map...?\nIris:\n...It's around here. To get there, you must follow a small path down from Dusky Bridge... The reality is, to get to the Inner Temple, I had no choice but to cross that bridge. But the thought that such a terrible criminal could be lurking at Heavenly Hall... I...

She testified very clearly as to what happened. She said she saw you stab Ms. Elise Deauxnim with a sword.\nIris:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nAnd one other thing. She said that when Maya Fey began her training at the Inner Temple... ...you were there as well.\nIris:\nWhat...!?\nEdgeworth:\nWhen I spoke with you last, you claimed that you never went to the Inner Temple. And yet, Sister Bikini says she met with you at the Inner Temple that very night.\nIris:\nB-But I... I didn't go there! I didn't go to the Inner Temple last night.\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm...

That's why I'm committed to searching until I have those answers. Now then, is it really true that you didn't go to the Inner Temple last night...?\nIris:\nY-Yes, I swear... I already told you that.\nEdgeworth:\n...Yes. You said you didn't go because you were frightened.\nIris:\n...Th-That's right.\nEdgeworth:\nIf that's the case... ...then the obvious question is, \"What were you so afraid of?\"\nIris:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nIris...

Why is your voice trembling like that?\nIris:\nIt's just that... Your eyes... Your eyes are scaring me...\nEdgeworth:\nUrk! (Blast! I must be trying too hard to bluff.) ...Please excuse me. I'm still not used to this role I've been assigned.\nIris:\nN-No, I should apologize... I'm sorry for being such a scaredy-cat.\nEdgeworth:\nAnyway... I'm still determined to find the answers to this mystery.\nIris:\nBut I'm telling you, I really was in my room all last night.\nLeads back to:\n\"If that's the case...\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI found this in the Main Hall.

After all, even if I did have a \"secret\"... ...there's no one to tell it to that would cause me any grief.\nEdgeworth:\n... Hmm... I wonder about that.\nIris:\nSister Bikini is like a mother to me. I would never hide anything from her!\nEdgeworth:\nNo, you may not have anything to hide under normal circumstances. However!

Is she peering into my soul!?) ...It's true that there is a deep-seated darkness in my heart.

And I can tell he holds a special place in your heart as well. That's why you didn't want him, of all people, to know your deep, dark secret. Well? What do you have to say?\nIris:\n...

And she's taken care of me ever since.\nEdgeworth:\nForgive me for sounding rude, but what about your family?\nIris:\n... I'm sorry, but I'd rather not talk about this.\n\n\n\n\nMaya Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nOh... This is the woman who was to undergo training last night.

I blew it again...Edgeworth:\n(\"Done that\"? What did he do, I wonder...)Gumshoe:\nHey! You! About what you just said... I got an objection!Butz:\nWh-Wh-Wh-What the...!? Ed-Edgey! You dirty rat!Edgeworth:\n*glare* (Gumshoe... You oaf...!)Gumshoe:\nI-I'm sorry, sir! Before I knew it, I was shouting out, \"Objection!\". And in a loud, commanding voice, too! I even pointed with my pointer finger!Edgeworth:\n...You've watched too many trials.Gumshoe:\nI'm sorry!Edgeworth:\nOK, Larry, the jig is up.

It runs pretty fast, so it doesn't ice over, even in the winter.\nEdgeworth:\nIf it had iced over, Wright would have been in some serious trouble.\nGumshoe:\nYou're right about that! He would've landed on the ice, and slid downstream to who knows where.\nEdgeworth:\n(...Not exactly what I meant, but alright...)\n\n\n\n\nDusky Bridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt's a little far, but I have a pretty clear view of Dusky Bridge from here.\nButz:\nAhh.

It's nothing!\nGumshoe:\nSounds pretty suspicious to me!\nEdgeworth:\n(Something about that statement smells... And you know what they say...)\n\n\n\n\nStairway\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThese go all the way to Dusky Bridge. It's a pretty long, but easy, walk.\nGumshoe:\nI fell down 4 times on my way down here, sir!\nButz:\nOh, sorry about that, Detective. I ate four bananas and tossed their peels on the stairs on my way down here...\nGumshoe:\n... What!? So that's what I was slipping on!\nButz:\nBe careful on the way back. Those deadly banana peels are still out there.\nGumshoe:\nHmm... That's a real important piece of information right there, Mr. Edgeworth!\n\n\n\n\nString of flags\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this festive-looking ornament?\nButz:\nIt reminds me of art class in grade school. We used to have a lot of fun decorating the classroom with origami. Remember?\nEdgeworth:\nW-Well, I...\nButz:\nOh, yeah... You were never any good at it.\nGumshoe:\nReally?\nButz:\nYeah, this guy was so bad, he couldn't even fold a dollar, let alone a crane. Everyone tried to comfort him, but he would just sit there sobbing.\nGumshoe:\nReally? I never would have expected that.\nEdgeworth:\nBe quiet already! I'll never forget the shame of that day! You want a crane! I can now make a perfect quarter-inch crane without a single flaw!\nButz:\n... You know, Edgey... Nothing for nothing, but a quarter-inch crane without a single flaw is not easy.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's quite a feat, Prosecutor Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\n(Grr... This is exactly why I hate childhood friends...)\n\n\n\n\nShack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThat's a horrible graffiti problem you've got there, pal.\nButz:\nYou don't know anything, Detective. This is art! It's an expression of my bittersweet love for Iris.\nEdgeworth:\nLarry. Do you know what the difference between graffiti and true art is?\nButz:\n... It's how the artist himself defines it, right?\nEdgeworth:\n...

I always did like the rustic look.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Heavenly Hall\"... I suppose it's an appropriate name in some sense.\nButz:\nYou got that right. Look at that bridge up there. This place has to be heaven, because that thing is hell.\nEdgeworth:\n...

I'm an artist... I was looking for a good place to sketch. This is a great little place! It's err... artistic. It's quiet, it's cold, it's got no power, and it looks like it's about to collapse.\nGumshoe:\n...Sounds a lot like my apartment there, pal.\nEdgeworth:\n(One thing's for sure... No one is likely to show up and disturb you here...)\nButz:\nSo can I get you something to drink? Some hot water, maybe?\nGumshoe:\n...He's getting all buddy-buddy on us, sir.\n\n\n\n\nIris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\n...Listen to me, Edgey. You've gotta do this... You've gotta save Iris!\nEdgeworth:\nWhy are you so sure she's innocent? Because she's cute?\nButz:\nWatch your mouth! Anyway, I've made up my mind about it! I'm going to marry that girl!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nGumshoe:\nUmm... Mr. Edgeworth is pretending he didn't hear you, so I'm gonna ask for him. Have you already asked this girl to marry you?\nButz:\nNo, no. Not yet. But I can tell how she feels by the look in her eyes! She's got this \"I really want this man to carry me over the threshold\" look! I'm sure Nick would be surprised! He'd never imagine that I could marry such a beautiful girl like that!\nEdgeworth:\nSomething tells me he would be shocked, indeed.\nButz:\nThat's why I didn't want her to do anything dangerous. I mean, what am I gonna do if she gets hurt?\nGumshoe:\n... What is this guy trying to say? He lost me about a mile back...\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... If we really want to know the answer to that... (...we're going to have to drag him onto the witness stand.)\n\n\n\n\nThe night of the crime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nCome to think of it, you still haven't answered my question. Where were you and what were you doing last night?\nButz:\nAww, man... Don't you have anything else to talk about? With that kind of attitude, you'll never be a ladies' man like me...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nButz:\nO-OK, OK! Chill out with those scary eyes! I got it! If you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Something incredible\"?\n\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n\nButz:\n...Yeah, yeah. But let's not talk about that now. Let's talk about the good old days. What do you say? Come on, I'll pour you a nice cup of hot water.\nEdgeworth:\n(Why hasn't he realized... ...that I absolutely despise talking about the \"good old days\", especially with him?)\n\n\n\n\nThe night of the crime (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat exactly did you see last night?\nButz:\nWell... It's kinda hard to say...\n\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n\nButz:\nIt's one of those things... Ya know what I mean...? It's like... It's not so much \"what\" I saw, as it's the situation in general... You see what I'm getting at? Whew, that's a relief. Thanks, buddy. Ha ha ha ha ha.\nEdgeworth:\n(I have the strangest urge to smash this guy against those big, nasty locks...)\n\n\n\n\nThe night of the crime (after breaking Psyche-Locks)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo you were here in Heavenly Hall last night, were you not, Larry? And you saw the lightning hit Dusky Bridge, didn't you?\nButz:\nS-Sorry, Edgey...\nGumshoe:\nSorry doesn't cut it, you scumbag! Threatening a young lady like that...\nButz:\n*gulp*... ... Wait, hold up.\nGumshoe:\n...What now, pal?\nButz:\nWhat are you talking about!? What \"threatening\" stuff!?\nGumshoe:\nI'll tell you what! You tried to scare Iris by threatening to expose her secret, pal!\nButz:\nWhat do you mean threaten!? When did I threaten her!?\nGumshoe:\n\"...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed...\" That sure sounds like a threat to me, pal! Blackmail, in fact!\nButz:\nGimme a break! It's a love letter! Haven't you ever been in love!?\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What did you just say!?\nButz:\nMy love for her burns so hotly, it could melt all the snow on this mountain!\nEdgeworth:\nO-Oh? Then what is this secret you mention!?\nButz:\nCome on, Edgey... Don't you get it? I'm talking about the secret love between her and me! Obviously she wouldn't want old lady Bikini to know about it, right...? About our... hot and sour... bittersweet love affair!\nEdgeworth:\n... Alright, then why did you send a love letter in a business-like manila envelope!?\nButz:\nGive me a break! It's not my fault I didn't have any other envelopes! Yeesh!\nGumshoe:\nThen why were you so quick to apologize, pal!?\nButz:\nIt's cuz Edgey gave me that scary look of his!\nEdgeworth:\n... ...\nButz:\nWhat's wrong, Edgey? Why are you so quiet all of a sudden?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's it? THAT'S what all those huge locks were about? (Changed from [That's it? That's all [sic] those huge locks were about?] in the original release) I-I don't understand why you were so defensive...\nButz:\nWell, I dunno either... I guess the thing is... ...you shouldn't expect too much from a guy like me. ...Hey, come on. Don't let it get you down!\nGumshoe:\n... B-But Mr. Edgeworth! This guy is still hiding something! I know it!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nDon't forget what this guy said just a minute ago!\n\n\nButz:\nIf you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible.\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm... He's right!) Larry!\nButz:\nWh-What!? Y-You're looking at me like a hungry dog that just found a bone!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat was this \"something incredible\" you saw last night...? ...You're going to tell me, Larry! One way or another!\n\n\n\n\nSomething incredible (appears after \"The night of the crime\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"I...

You're really upset, aren't you, Edgey? OK, I'll talk!\nEdgeworth:\n...Huh? (That was a bit too easy...)\nButz:\nYeah, anyway! It was awesome! Never seen anything like it! At around 10 o'clock last night, it started thundering. I'd been sleeping... I'm not sure for how long. Suddenly... ZING! The world in front of me went white! Like I'd just been slapped in the face by my old girlfriend, Naomi!\nEdgeworth:\n...And then?\nButz:\nAnd then... It was on fire! The bridge was on fire!\nEdgeworth:\nDusky Bridge caught on fire!? Are you saying you saw it with your own eyes?\nButz:\nHey! Why are you giving me the evil eye!? I'm telling the truth!\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm... There are still three Psycholocks remaining... (Changed from [Hmm... There are still 3 Psycholocks remaining...] in the original release) That means he's still trying to hide something...) By the way, Larry... Where were you when you saw that happen?\nButz:\nWh-Wh-Wh-Where you say? Wh-Wh-What do you mean!?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean, \"What do I mean\"!? ...Just answer the question!\nButz:\nI-I was in my own room... by the Main Hall! Where else would I be!?\nEdgeworth:\nAs usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar. The problem, I suspect, lies there...\nButz:\nTh-Th-Th-Th-There?

Try drinking your hot water. If you don't drink it fast it's going to get cold.\nEdgeworth:\nOh, sorry... (It's cold alright... The water... And my evidence.)\nButz:\nWell? Have you calmed down yet?\nEdgeworth:\nUm, yes... I'm going to think it over again.\nButz:\nH-Hey, I'm telling you... there's nothing to think over! I was in my room doing \"she loves me, she loves me not\" with a bunch of flowers.\nLeads back to:\n\"As usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar.\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis is a map of the area. Take a look around the vicinity of Hazakura Temple.\nButz:\nWh-What am I looking for?\nEdgeworth:\nI think that should be fairly obvious. The Main Hall is surrounded by trees and it's impossible to see the bridge from here.\nButz:\nWhat...!? Why didn't you tell me that before!?\n\n1 LOCK BROKEN\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Well? How about it?\nButz:\nHow about what?\nEdgeworth:\nDo you feel like talking now?\nButz:\nAbout what?\nEdgeworth:\n... (It looks like it won't be that easy after all...) ...You leave me no choice. I'll have to move on to the next step. You weren't in your room at the temple. So then... Where were you?\nButz:\nY-Y-You don't know that I wasn't in my room!\nEdgeworth:\n(So where was Larry, and why was he there...? If I've read the situation up to this point correctly, the answer is fairly obvious.) ...Very well then. Let's test my theory. The place you witnessed lightning striking Dusky Bridge from was... here!\n\n\n\nPresent Heavenly Hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall!\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis is where you were! Well, what do you think, Larry!?\nButz:\nOh... Not much I guess.\nEdgeworth:\n... I'm sorry, but what kind of answer is that?\nButz:\nWell, you were just making small talk, right? Like \"How are you doing?\" or something.\nEdgeworth:\n...Larry. Look at the expression on my face. Do I look like I was just making small talk?\nButz:\nTo be honest? No... I guess not. Ha ha ha ha ha...\nEdgeworth:\n(It appears I didn't think it through carefully enough.)\nLeads back to:\n\"So where was Larry, and why was he there...?\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall!\nButz:\n...Wh-Why would I be hanging out in this old shack? It's freezing cold, there's no electricity, and it could fall apart at any minute...\nEdgeworth:\nLarry... How do you know that anyway? How do you know there's no electricity? After all, it's not that dark yet.\nButz:\nAh... Uh-oh!\nEdgeworth:\nIn other words, you have just provided evidence to prove my theory... My theory that you've at least once in your life visited Heavenly Hall after sunset!\n\n1 LOCK BROKEN\n\nButz:\nI have to admit I'm impressed, Edgey! You're in a totally different league from Nick.\nEdgeworth:\n...That's nice. Now tell me. What were you doing at this cold little shack last night?\nButz:\nThat's what you might call... A \"Fair de Core\".\nEdgeworth:\nI think you mean \"affaire de coeur\". Could it be you were... waiting for someone?\nButz:\nOoooh nooo! Y-You really are one scary guy, you know...\nEdgeworth:\nI believe that last night, you were waiting for this person to come meet you!\n\n\n\nPresent Iris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n \nEdgeworth:\n...Well, Larry!? Was it THIS person...?\nButz:\n...You know what? You should save your finger pointing for the courtroom.\nEdgeworth:\nTsk...!\nButz:\nIt's no wonder people call you a workaholic. You work too hard! You should be like me!\nEdgeworth:\n(Well, I'd rather \"work too hard\" than \"hardly work\" like a loafaholic like you...) In any case... I know you were waiting for someone!\nButz:\nYeah, but... It's like I said. It's an \"affaire de guerre\".\nEdgeworth:\nNo, Larry. You mean \"affaire de coeur\". At least I think you do.\nLeads back to:\n\"Could it be you were... waiting for someone?\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry.\nButz:\nI told you before... Don't call me \"Larry\"...\nEdgeworth:\nThe person you were waiting for was... Iris!\nButz:\nOhh... Suddenly I feel cold all over, Edgey.\nEdgeworth:\nNo doubt because of my chilly glare.\nButz:\nSo you think I got the hots for Sister Iris, huh...? D-Do you have some kind of evidence!? You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing?\nEdgeworth:\n(This is where I draw the line and end this ridiculous little game...)

I hate making such stupid mistakes...)\nButz:\nDo you really have the evidence you say you do, Edgey?\nLeads back to:\n\"You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing?\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Here's your evidence. You called her to this spot with a pathetic blackmail letter!\nButz:\nOh! H-Hey! G-G-Give that back! You're embarrassing me! What are you doing with that anyway!?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's not important! ...I misjudged you, Larry.\nButz:\nWhat do you mean...?\nEdgeworth:\nTaking advantage of a woman's frailty like that! You should be ashamed of yourself!\nButz:\nOhhh... OHHHH!\nEdgeworth:\nFirst of all, what's this at the top of the letter? It says, \"Salutation here\"!\nButz:\nW-Well that's what it said in that book, \"Letter Writing for Dummies\"!\nEdgeworth:\nYou're not supposed to actually write that!

However, the same cannot be said for the prosecution in this case.Edgeworth:\n...Indeed.Judge:\nI'm not sure I like such blatant waste of this court's time. An empty prosecutor's chair can only mean... ...that the prosecutor has no confidence in their ability to prove their case. It would seem this case is already over before it had a chance to begin.

Prosecuting prodigy.Judge:\nV-Von Karma, you say...? Perchance, you wouldn't be of any relation to the legendary prosecutor Manfred von Karma?von Karma:\n... Legends are a thing of the past. I am a Von Karma. That is all. Upon a special request, I flew in today for the purposes of prosecuting this case.Judge:\nY-You did!? Then... you must be quite a big shot, eh! By the way, Mr. Edgeworth...Edgeworth:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nI'm almost certain that I've seen you somewhere before. Or am I just imagining things? You look very much like a prosecutor I met once...Edgeworth:\n...I believe you are imagining things, Your Honor.Judge:\nMs. von Karma? Do you have anything to say?von Karma:\n... There is no such weakling as this man among those of the Prosecutor's Office.Judge:\nThere... there isn't...? But I'm sure... once before, in this courtroom...

People acting bizarrely in my court! Uwa-hah!von Karma:\n...The stage is set. Now continue with the proceedings, Your Honor.Judge:\nVery well. Ms. von Karma, please give an outline of this case. With as little whipping as possible!von Karma:\nThe murder victim is the famed picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Her body was found in the Hazakura Temple courtyard. She had been stabbed through the torso by a ceremonial sword from a golden statue.Judge:\nThe sword in this picture... is the weapon in question, correct...? ...Very well. The court accepts this photo of the crime scene.Crime Photo added to the Court Record.von Karma:\nThere is no mistake. This was the doing of Sister Iris.

Fetch a crate for this poor lady, please!von Karma:\n...Once again. Your name and occupation, please.Bikini:\nLittle old me? Well, I'm the head nun of Hazakura Temple on Eagle Mountain. My name is Bikini. You got it? Bikini. Nice to meet everyone.Judge:\n... But you don't appear to be wearing a bikini right now... Uwah!von Karma:\n...The courtroom is the garden of holy judgment. Those with lechery in their hearts should leave this sanctuary at once!Judge:\nY-You want me to leave!?Bikini:\nNo need to get your bikinis in a twist! Let me tell you, I'm a sight to behold in summer! Wha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha!Edgeworth:\nIn any case... Witness. I hear that you saw the crime take place on the night in question.Bikini:\nThat's right! I can still hardly believe it myself, to be honest. There's no way dear little Iris could do anything like that...Judge:\nLet us hear what you have to say then. First, tell us aboot your own movements that night, eh!Witness Testimony-- The Night of the Murder --Bikini:\nThat night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But...\nWell, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently.\nSo, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.\nThere's no bath at the Inner Temple, you see, and I needed a long, hot soak.\nIt was after I had finished, just as I was heading back... that's when I saw it!Judge:\nHmm... So it was simply coincidence that you found yourself returning to Hazakura Temple?Bikini:\n...Yes, you could say that. If my back hadn't been in so much pain, I would have stayed at the Inner Temple.Edgeworth:\n(That sounds like a pretty important statement she just made...)von Karma:\nThere is only one problem with this testimony that I can see... And you're not about to fall at the first hurdle, now are you, Miles Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth. ...Please begin your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- The Night of the Murder --Bikini:\nThat night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this Inner Temple...?\nBikini:\nWell, see, conversing with the spirits is what we train people to do, right?\nJudge:\nWe'll be the ones asking you the questions, madam.\nBikini:\n...In order to do that, a place strong in spiritual power is required. There's a small temple across Dusky Bridge, called the Inner Temple.  Acolytes must spend an entire night there to undergo intense training.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd how exactly do you help with this process...?\nBikini:\nIt is all quite exacting. It can't be performed without a nun supervising.\nvon Karma:\nLike a tutor, watching to make sure a spoiled child studies.\nEdgeworth:\n(A tutor with a whip, in your case.) If that is the case... ...then why did you return to Hazakura Temple, where the murder took place?Bikini:\nWell, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nViolently...?\nBikini:\nThat's right. It's no laughing matter, especially in winter! I can't hold anything heavier than a knife and fork during the cold months! Just being alive is like strict training! Wah ha ha! Wha ha! Wah ha ha!\nEdgeworth:\nOn the night of the murder, was this fabulous back of yours hurting again...?\nBikini:\nThat's right. Raging like a bull in a pigpen. I almost fainted once or twice! I just knew that unless I warmed it up, it was going to finally finish me off!Bikini:\nSo, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou \"left Iris to help\"... With what?\nBikini:\nWhat do you think? The acolyte's training, of course. It was just past 10 PM, so we were starting to enter into the training exercises proper.\nJudge:\nWasn't it your place to remain with the disciple?\nBikini:\nWell, the job is simply to watch over the acolyte so that they don't pass away.\nEdgeworth:\nJust to confirm this point again, that night... ...you met Iris in the Inner Temple, correct?\nBikini:\nYes, yes. She's a gentle, honest girl. She's never once failed to follow my directions.Present Iris's Testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Witnesses have to undergo their own trials, I'm afraid. The defendant's fate rests on their powers of observation and memory, after all.\nBikini:\nWell, well, well. Don't worry! I'm more than up to the task! I'm a woman of faith, after all. The head honcho of Hazakura Temple.\nEdgeworth:\nIn that case, Ms. Honcho... I'd like you to explain something for me. The discrepancy between your testimony and that of the defendant, Iris. She claims that after ringing the lights out bell, she went back and stayed in her room. ...Which means! She did not go to the Inner Temple at all!\nBikini:\nN... No...! She said that...?\nvon Karma:\n\nvon Karma:\nA defendant or a witness... Who is more likely to lie, do you suppose? The defendant is simply lying to cover her back!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nBut that is completely illogical. The murder was committed in the courtyard of Hazakura Temple. Claiming that she \"went to the Inner Temple\" would make for a much better alibi.\nvon Karma:\n...!\nBikini:\nBut that is odd... Whatever the reason... I can't believe that she would lie...!\nJudge:\nHmm... she does indeed have honest eyes! Uwaaaah!\nvon Karma:\n...All people lie. That is my belief.\nJudge:\nWhy am I the only one being whipped in here...!? Anyway! Neither the witness nor the defendant have any reason to lie! Which means... We must call your memory into question...\nBikini:\nDear, dear, dear. You're older than me and yet you want to play that game, do you?\nJudge:\nA-Ah, well, that isn't exactly what I...\nBikini:\nMy memory is perfect! Crystal clear! Especially in winter!\nJudge:\nThen... I suppose it's too early to end this cross-examination, eh. Mr. Edgeworth. If you are going to question the memory of this witness... ...you will need to show me a more decisive piece of evidence.\nEdgeworth:\n...Understood, Your Honor. (I was naïve to think that alone would do the trick.)\nJudge:\nThen please add your comments aboot Iris to the testimony... And let us return to the cross-examination.\nChanges statement from \"So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.\" to \"Iris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner.\"Bikini:\nIris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nAre you sure that you're not making a mistake...?\nBikini:\n...You, young man, need to get your estimation of me up from the floor!\nEdgeworth:\nNngh...!\nBikini:\nIris always wears the same clothes. The smallest thing out of place would have stood out like a sore thumb to me! You're making a mistake, thinking I made a mistake!\nJudge:\n...An excellent finish there, witness.\nEdgeworth:\n(Still, I have to wonder...)Present Iris's Hood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...Witness. Let's get one thing straight.\"Bikini:\nThere's no bath at the Inner Temple, you see, and I needed a long, hot soak.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...So you returned to the Hazakura Temple in order to take a bath?\nBikini:\nMy back is to blame for everything. It's a \"do or be done in\" kind of world, after all.\nEdgeworth:\nHow long were you in the bath for, if you don't mind me asking?\nBikini:\n... My my my, what a filthy little rogue you are! I know what's on your mind!\nEdgeworth:\n...?\nBikini:\nI bet your next question is going to be, \"Where exactly did you wash?\" Ah, THIS is why you have to watch the young ones...\nEdgeworth:\nW-What are you going on about!? I was... Gwah!\nvon Karma:\n...Pathetic, Miles Edgeworth.\nJudge:\nThe lowest of the low.\nEdgeworth:\n(Is there some sort of \"Kick Me\" sign stuck to the defense's bench!?)\nBikini:\nAnyway, I couldn't afford to be away from my post for too long, you understand, so...Bikini:\nIt was after I had finished, just as I was heading back... that's when I saw it!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe crime took place in the courtyard, correct...?\nBikini:\nWhen you go from my room to the Main Hall... ...you have to take a winding hallway from which you can see the courtyard.\nvon Karma:\nThat's right. In other words... ...it was pure coincidence that the witness saw the crime taking place before her eyes. There was no complicated set-up in this case!\nJudge:\nHmm... That certainly seems to be true.Edgeworth:\n(There is indeed only one problem with this testimony. If I can clearly point out what it is, then I can begin to quantify... ...just how good this witness's memory and observation skills are.)Edgeworth:\n...Witness. Let's get one thing straight. The defendant whom you claim to have met... ...she was wearing this \"Demon-Warding Hood\", correct?Bikini:\nOf course! That is a very important piece of clothing, I'll have you know! Wha ha ha! Wha ha ha! Ha ha... Wait a minute...von Karma:von Karma:\nH-Hold it right there! Why do you have that...!?Edgeworth:\nThat's the question of the day, now isn't it... Ms. von Karma? I'll have you know that this hood was given to someone as a gift that night. Before the lights out bell was rung.von Karma:\nW... What!?Edgeworth:\n...You know where I'm going with this, don't you? If the witness had seen the defendant as she claims... ...then the Iris she saw should have been missing this very hood! (Changed from [...the defendant couldn't have been wearing this very hood!] in the original release)Bikini:\nWell well well!Edgeworth:\n(It's not a bad feeling at all, exposing contradictions like this... Now I understand that happy look on Wright's face every time he does it...)Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Witness, your response... Wuahaaa!von Karma:\n...Sister. This hood... You have spare ones around the temple, don't you?Bikini:\nSpares... Well... I do tend to make too many of them.Judge:\nI see... A stockpile. A surplus of hoods, eh?Bikini:\nEach nun is only given one hood. This should be the only hood that Iris owned...Judge:\nHmm... Then this is quite strange! Waaaah!von Karma:\nIf there was a surplus of hoods, then she could have worn one of those! ...There is no contradiction here!Judge:\nHmm...Edgeworth:\n(I'm sorry to break this to you, Ms. von Karma... but you won't get away that easily. Discrepancies such as this will sow seeds in any human heart. The seeds of doubt.)Judge:\n...Witness. While I don't wish to call your testimony into doubt... ...you must give every detail with precision.Bikini:\nI-I'm not sure I'm comfortable going along with this...von Karma:\nSister. You shall continue with your testimony. Tell us what you saw after finishing your bath, on your way back to the Inner Temple!Edgeworth:\n(Those seeds of doubt are sprouting in the judge's heart. They just need a little more stimulation to bear fruit... Contradictory stimulation.)Witness Testimony-- After My Bath --Bikini:\nI finished my bath around 11, and I thought I should return to the Inner Temple.\nAnd as I was walking back... I heard a noise from the courtyard. I took a look and...\nIris was...! Oh, Mystic Elise! And with that sword, of all things!\nMystic Elise was staying in the corner room, which faces out onto the courtyard.\nThe stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window.Judge:\nYou saw a truly terrible sight, didn't you...? If I was in your place... ...then it would be much like Ms. von Karma whipping Mr. Edgeworth in two in court! And me, seeing it all from this very chair! ...Er, well, something like that.Edgeworth:\n(This judge... His imagination is about as vivid and creative as Detective Gumshoe...)von Karma:\nI would look the fool if I commented on such foolishness. Anyway, this case is mine... Miles Edgeworth!Edgeworth:\nCalling everyone by their full name... Can't you do something about that habit of yours?Cross Examination-- After My Bath --Bikini:\nI finished my bath around 11, and I thought I should return to the Inner Temple.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...How far is it from your room to the Inner Temple?\nBikini:\nLet me think a moment... About twenty minutes, on these stumps of mine. It's about 15 minutes to Dusky Bridge from Hazakura Temple. The Inner Temple is just beyond the bridge.\nvon Karma:\nStill, you never made it back there that night, did you?\nBikini:\nT-That's right... I was heading along the walkway toward the Main Hall...Bikini:\nAnd as I was walking back... I heard a noise from the courtyard. I took a look and...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou say you heard a noise...?\nBikini:\n\"Thump\"... Just like that.\nvon Karma:\n...That could only be the sound of the victim falling.\nBikini:\nIt's very quiet in the temple, you know. You can even hear the snow falling from the branches. \"Thump\"... Just like that.\nJudge:\nBut then, couldn't this noise you heard have been snow falling to the ground?\nBikini:\n... I never thought of that. Wah ha ha. Wha ha ha. Ha ha...\nJudge:\nHoh hoh. Hoh hoh. Hoh hoh... Uaaaaaah!\nvon Karma:\nThe next one to laugh gets a whipping!\nBikini:\nWell. Whatever the source of the sound, I looked over at the courtyard and...Bikini:\nIris was...! Oh, Mystic Elise! And with that sword, of all things!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...This is the second time that the witness has testified to seeing the defendant. But... some doubt remains in these claims.\nBikini:\nHey, just what does that mean!? Just because you're a good-looking young man doesn't give you the right to...\nEdgeworth:\nThe murderer who stabbed the victim with the sword... Sister Bikini, try to recall exactly who it was you saw! As clearly as you can!\nBikini:\nHmm... Well. You're a handsome young man, so I'll forgive you. ... Oh! Now that you mention it... There was something awfully strange about her... Something that has been bugging me all this time!\nEdgeworth:\n...Please, don't keep us in suspense.\nBikini:\nHer hood!\nvon Karma:\nHer hood...?\nBikini:\nThat's right! ...It's coming back to me... Iris... She wasn't wearing her hood! I thought something was out of place, but... It all makes sense now, doesn't it? After all, she'd given that hood away to someone, right?\nEdgeworth:\n...Urk!\nvon Karma:\nHah... You've dug your own grave, Miles Edgeworth!\nJudge:\nWhat do you say, Mr. Edgeworth? Is this testimony important?\n\n\n\nIt's not important\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(...This line of questioning is only going to tear the  wound open further.) These statements are as useless as the investigations of a certain detective. ...There is no need to record them.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nJudge:\nVery well. ...Please, continue with your testimony.\nvon Karma:\nHmph...\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nIt's important\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(This may initially appear to put me at a disadvantage... But, I can't see any other leads at the moment...) ...Your Honor. I would like these new statements to be added to the testimony.\nvon Karma:\nHeh... Miles Edgeworth.\nvon Karma:\nIf you want to hang yourself, you need only to ask. I'll gladly lend you my whip!\nJudge:\nWitness. Add that statement to your testimony.\nBikini:\n...No problem.\nAdds statement \"Now that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on.\"Bikini:\nNow that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou are sure about that...?\nBikini:\nYes. After all, we always wear the same clothes. Ah! I don't mean because we're poor, you understand? It's our style. Yes, that's it!\nEdgeworth:\n...There's absolutely no need to explain yourself.\nBikini:\nAnyway! She looked different from normal, so that really stuck out.\nvon Karma:\nLike me holding a whippet puppy instead of my whip.\nEdgeworth:\n(At least then it might bite you and not someone else...)\nBikini:\nIris didn't have her hood on. I'm sure of it!\nJudge:\n...Very well. Now, please tell us aboot the victim, eh.Bikini:\nMystic Elise was staying in the corner room, which faces out onto the courtyard.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe room the victim was staying in overlooked the courtyard, correct?\nJudge:\nWhich means... the victim's room was on the second floor?\nBikini:\nNo, no. Hazakura Temple is a single story building. But the mountain itself slopes downward... ...which elevates the Main Gate side of the temple and the guest rooms in the back... ...to about the height of a two story building.\nJudge:\nI see... And the victim was staying in one of these elevated rooms, correct?\nBikini:\nYes... I should know. I'm the one who carried her things to her room, after all...Bikini:\nThe stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat makes you so sure of all this...?\nBikini:\nIt's just like I told you earlier... \"I heard a noise from the courtyard.\" OK? \"Thump\"... Just like that.\nvon Karma:\nYou're one smart sister, I'll give you that. The autopsy report states that... ...the victim's body was covered in bruises... ...indicating a fall from around 10 feet in height.\nJudge:\nHmm... It appears that the witness was not mistaken then.\nBikini:\nYep. Yep. I'm more than just a pretty face. Especially in winter! I'm a woman of faith, after all. The head honcho of Hazakura Temple.\nEdgeworth:\n(There's only two of them working there...!)\nvon Karma:\nWhat's wrong, Miles Edgeworth? No snappy comeback remark?\nEdgeworth:\n...Present Elise's Autopsy Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...Impressive logic. That's what I'd like to say, anyway.\"Edgeworth:\n(...It doesn't feel like she is lying. This is very powerful testimony, too. She claims to have seen the instant in which the defendant stabbed the victim... There are only two things I can believe in right now... My client, Iris, and my own abilities as a defense attorney.)Edgeworth:\n...Impressive logic. That's what I'd like to say, anyway.Bikini:\nOh please, do! My brain is something else... especially in winter!Edgeworth:\nHowever... I think you are overlooking one thing. ...Ms. von Karma. Would you be so kind as to take another look at the autopsy report?von Karma:\nT-The autopsy report...?Edgeworth:\nThe victim did fall from a height of 10 feet. ...However. This fall... was after she was killed.von Karma:\nAh...!Judge:\nT-That's right! It says \"after death\" right here!Edgeworth:\nThe scene the witness claims to have seen is contradictory! If the defendant stabbed and killed the victim there in the courtyard... ...how did the victim then go on to take a ten foot fall!?von Karma:\nAaah!Judge:\nO-Order! Order! The victim was killed and then fell! If that is the case... ...then the victim must have been killed in her room... Don't you agree?von Karma:\nTh-That is the logical conclusion... Yes, that's right! The victim must have been stabbed by the defendant in her own room! And she was then thrown out of her window down into the courtyard below!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nWere there any signs of a struggle in Ms. Deauxnim's room...?von Karma:\n...!Edgeworth:\nShe was stabbed with a sword! That would leave a blood stain, wouldn't you agree?Judge:\nW-Well, Ms. von Karma? Was there any blood...? Waaaaaah!von Karma:\n...No traces of blood were found in the victim's room.Judge:\n...Your whip has just caused traces of blood to be found on my glorious playoff beard. However! If there was no blood in the room, then your claim that... Waaaaah!von Karma:\nI'm sure there's no need for me to go over this... ...as I'm sure Your Honor is well aware... ...of when a stab wound produces the most blood.Judge:\nWhen it produces the most blood...?von Karma:\nVery little blood is actually lost at the moment of a blade's insertion. If you want to talk about when the most blood would be lost from a body... ...that would be when the blade is removed.Edgeworth:\nIndeed. With the weapon still in place... ...it acts like a lid on the wound.Judge:\nThat's true... With the weapon still in the body, there wouldn't be much bleeding... A perfectly reasonable line of thinking!von Karma:\nWe have come to a conclusion then! The victim was thrown out of the window with the sword still in place... This removes all of the contradictions!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! I must admit that this is a probable version of events!Edgeworth:\n(I'd expect no less from Franziska von Karma... She locates and takes control of every vital point!)von Karma:\n...Hmph...Judge:\nIt seems... ...that we need a clearer testimony from the witness. Remove all supposition on your part and tell us only the truth, please! Witness! Please! Remain standing on the crate!Bikini:\nDon't go selling me short now! The weight of winter snow has bent me out of shape! ...Especially my back and my mood!von Karma:\nSister. Please, give us your testimony. I will give you a vigorous massage once we are finished here.Edgeworth:\n(...With the whip?)Bikini:\n...Oh, boy. Alright, alright...Witness Testimony-- Further Details --Bikini:\nWhen I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place.\nThinking about it now, I didn't actually see her stab Mystic Elise.\nI've never seen so much blood before...\nThat's when I fainted. You can't blame me, can you?\nAnd when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back!Judge:\nHmm... This all confirms Ms. von Karma's theory...von Karma:\nVon Karmas strive for nothing but perfection. Putting together such facts is nothing for me! You should know that, Miles Edgeworth!Edgeworth:\n(\"Perfection\" is an impossibility, Franziska von Karma... And I'm here to teach you just that...)Cross Examination-- Further Details --Bikini:\nWhen I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nAt that time... was the victim bleeding?\nBikini:\nWell... I was very shocked to be seeing all this, of course... So I'm not entirely sure... But I don't think I saw any blood. Not then.\nvon Karma:\n...I'm sure that you didn't. The weapon was acting as a plug in the wound.\nEdgeworth:\nIn any case... Let's be clear on one very important point. Did you actually see the instant in which the victim was stabbed!?Bikini:\nThinking about it now, I didn't actually see her stab Mystic Elise.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Think carefully. This is very important.\nBikini:\nIt's Iris we are talking about here! I'm thinking for all I'm worth! ... No, when I looked over, the sword was already in Mystic Elise's body.\nJudge:\nHmmmmmm...\nEdgeworth:\n(It might not be  conclusive, but... ...this testimony supports her theory.)\nvon Karma:\nThe victim was stabbed in her room and then dropped into the courtyard... ...I think this proves it rather well, Miles Edgeworth.Bikini:\nI saw the instant in which the blade, plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n\"Smoothly\", you say... You're saying you saw the sword smoothly slide out?\nBikini:\nThat's right...\nBikini:\nThe whole thing happened right next to the gold statue of Mystic Ami. Mystic Elise was on the ground, and Iris was stooped over her. The sword was buried up to the hilt. When Iris stood up, the sword in her hand just slid out of Mystic Elise's body. It slid out from that gaping wound...! Aaaah...\nJudge:\nIt goes without saying... that if the sword was removed there would be bleeding.\nvon Karma:\n...Nothing out of place here.\nEdgeworth:\n(Is that really the case...? I can't help but feel that something about this testimony is very out of place... That something which couldn't possibly have happened... appears to have happened.)Present Shichishito\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Sister Bikini. You are a reliable witness...\"Bikini:\nI've never seen so much blood before...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...So you're saying that you saw the victim's blood?\nBikini:\nT-That's right! Some of it had splattered onto Iris, too...\nvon Karma:\nWhen the defendant was arrested, she was meditating in her room. And her blood-flecked clothing was neatly folded in the corner.\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What!? (Her clothes were blood-flecked as well...?)\nJudge:\nHmmm... That seems quite conclusive to me...\nEdgeworth:\n(What should I do...? Press this point further?)\n\n\n\nStop here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I can't afford to make things look any worse for the defendant. I'll bide my time for now.)\nJudge:\n...Witness. Please continue your testimony. From after you witnessed the victim bleeding!\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nGoing back to your previous statement... ...you said that you saw little bleeding when the victim was stabbed. But now... you say you saw the victim bleeding...?\nBikini:\nWell, well. I say that what I saw is what I saw.\nJudge:\nW-What did you see?\nBikini:\nMaybe I didn't see the poor woman get stabbed... But I saw the girl pull the sword out of her, plain as day.\nEdgeworth:\nPulling the sword out...?\nBikini:\nWell, it wasn't exactly pulling... It was more like it \"came out\".\nJudge:\nWitness! You will add this statement to your testimony!\nBikini:\nOh... Was that important...!?\nEdgeworth:\n(More important than you can imagine...)\nAdds statement \"I saw the instant in which the blade, plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out.\"Press (after adding statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWas the bleeding caused by the killer removing the sword...?\nBikini:\nNo mistaking it! I remember it all, clear as day!\nEdgeworth:\n...Don't you think that's a bit odd?\nvon Karma:\nWhat do you mean, Miles Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nWhy would the killer pull out the sword?\nvon Karma:\nWhat...?\nEdgeworth:\nIf all she wanted to do was place the weapon in the hand of the gold statue... ...then there was no reason to remove it from the body. All that would've accomplished is causing the victim to bleed unnecessarily. ...Your thoughts, Ms. von Karma?\nvon Karma:\nT-That's...\nJudge:\nIndeed... It is strange, now that you mention it.\nEdgeworth:\n(I'm going to need to find an answer to this mystery, too...)\nvon Karma:\nA-Anyway! The witness saw something terrible! ...So what did you do after that, witness?Bikini:\nThat's when I fainted. You can't blame me, can you?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nNow, on to what the killer did next... You saw none of it? Correct?\nBikini:\nWell... I was unconscious...\nvon Karma:\nHow long were you out for?\nBikini:\nI don't know... 10, maybe 20 minutes...? A young man with a very prickly looking head woke me up. ...By stepping on me, actually.\nJudge:\nHmm... I'm not sure I like that method of resuscitation!\nBikini:\nWell, I wasn't asking for mouth-to-mouth, or anything of the sort... ...but I would've welcomed a more gentle awakening right about then, let me tell you.\nEdgeworth:\n...I shall have words with the offender personally. What did you see upon awakening...?Bikini:\nAnd when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nBy \"Mystic Ami\", you are referring to the golden statue, correct?\nBikini:\nJust stabbing someone with the Shichishito, a sacred treasure, is terrible enough.\nBikini:\nBut to then make Mystic Ami hold the blade...!\nvon Karma:\nTruly, a heinous, despicable crime.\nEdgeworth:\nIt is easy to despise something. Anyone can do it. However, there is something that cannot be done so easily...\nvon Karma:\nWhatever it is, I'm sure it's doubly hard for you. Anyway, what is the problem?\nEdgeworth:\nExactly why would the killer set up this gruesome scene? Can anyone explain the reasoning behind that?\nvon Karma:\n...!\nJudge:\nHmmmmm... No, I don't think I can.\nvon Karma:\n... There isn't always a logical reason behind why someone acts!\nBikini:\nThat's true, so true. In early spring, for example, I often find myself...\nEdgeworth:\n(\"There isn't always\"... That phrase might come in handy someday.)Edgeworth:\n(There are too many unnatural elements in this case... Why was it necessary to use the Shichishito from the Ami statue as a weapon? Why was the weapon finally placed back in the hand of the statue? If I can expose the flaws in this testimony, perhaps then I will begin to find the truth.)Edgeworth:\nSister Bikini. You are a reliable witness... At least, I'd like to think so. But there are too many contradictions here.Bikini:\nW-What do you mean? You make it sound as though I'm a liar! But... You're a handsome young man, so I'll forgive you.von Karma:\nWhat contradictions are you talking about?Edgeworth:\nIn the scene that the witness claims to have seen... ...the weapon was thrust up to its hilt into the victim. Furthermore... the killer withdrew the weapon smoothly from the body. ...However! Both of these are complete impossibilities!Judge:\nWhat do you mean...? Please, explain you... Uwaaaaah!von Karma:\nExplain yourself!Edgeworth:\nTo start with... Do you think it would be possible to stab someone to the hilt with this? No matter how I look at the defendant, she doesn't appear strong enough for that.von Karma:von Karma:\n\"Doesn't appear\"...? What meaningless dribble! I, too, may appear to be weak and frail... But I can crush men under my heel and make them weep, should I so choose!Judge:\nThe objection stands! I wept a little back there, I must admit.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\n...That isn't the only issue here. If this sword was truly stabbed into the body up to the hilt... Well, just look at all the branches on it. It certainly wouldn't come out smoothly.von Karma:\nT-That's...Edgeworth:\nWe also have the problem of the amount of bleeding. It's true that when a blade is left in a body, it acts as a \"plug\" of sorts. However! When the weapon is shaped like this, it's an entirely different story. The wound would be too large for the blade to completely stop from bleeding!von Karma:von Karma:\nT-That's nothing more than conjecture! In reality, the victim was stabbed with the Shichishito. Even a weapon of this nature... ...may still sometimes slide out smoothly, and may still sometimes stop the blood loss!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nI'm not finished. There is still one more... conclusive contradiction.Judge:\nY-You've still got more!?Edgeworth:\n...This one is simple. If this sword really was thrust in all the way to the hilt... ...why is there only blood on the tip of it?von Karma:\nAh...!Edgeworth:\nIf this witness is telling the truth... Then there should be blood along the entire length of the sword!von Karma:\nNoooooo!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Ord-- Whaaaaaaaa!von Karma:\nBravo... Miles Edgeworth. Raising this many contradictions from a single piece of evidence! All the other attorneys I know could maybe manage one, if that!Judge:\nBut what does this all mean!? You have proven contradictions regarding the murder weapon, but...Edgeworth:\n...Having come this far, there can only be one answer.von Karma:\nAnd that is...?Edgeworth:\nThe weapon used to kill the victim... ...was not the Shichishito!Judge:\nW-Whaaaaaaaaat!?von Karma:\nA foolishly foolish idea born from the foolish mind of a foolhardy foolish fool.Edgeworth:\nLet's examine this again. What was it that made us think this sword was the murder weapon?Bikini:\nW-Well... It's because Mystic Ami was holding it...Edgeworth:\n...Exactly. However! If you reflect on this, that is the only basis we have to assume such a thing. The impression left by the scene was just too strong. That is what influenced us. It influenced us to believe that the Shichishito was the murder weapon!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! Waaaaaaaaah!von Karma:\nSo maybe the Shichishito was not the murder weapon. Even if that is the case... it changes nothing, Miles Edgeworth! The Sister here saw everything! She saw the defendant stab the victim with a sword-like object.Judge:\nHmmmmmm... That's true! Your response, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\n... If that is so... I would like the prosecution to answer the obvious question it raises.Judge:\nThe obvious... question?Edgeworth:\n...Yes. Namely... Where did the real murder weapon disappear to?von Karma:\n...!Edgeworth:\nIt goes without saying that the police searched the Main Hall and the surrounding area. ...Perhaps the prosecution can enlighten us as to if a \"sword-like object\" was found.von Karma:\nT-That's...Judge:\nAnswer the question, Ms. von Karma!von Karma:\n... No evidence of that kind was found.Judge:\nHmmmmm... Another mystery to throw onto the pile! A trial without a murder weapon is a tricky beast!Bikini:\nExcuse me... Could I say something...? I just remembered something, actually...von Karma:\n...What is it, Sister?Bikini:\nI was just thinking... It's possible... ...that just maybe... what actually happened was... it was just over there...Judge:\n... What exactly are you going on aboot here?Bikini:\nThe murder weapon, I mean! Maybe... I think I might know where the sword was disposed of!Edgeworth:\nYou what!?von Karma:\nWell then... I think we need to hear testimony from you one more time, Sister.Edgeworth:\n(Impossible...! What else... What else could this old woman have seen!?)Witness Testimony-- Location of the Weapon --Bikini:\nI saw the murder at around 11 PM...\nAnd after asking that it be reported, I went out to the Main Gate.\nAnd there... I saw tracks! Tracks that indicated the snowmobile had been used!\nIt takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, but less than 5 using one of those!\nMaybe they threw the weapon into Eagle River and came back while I was knocked out?\n...Iris could have done that. She can drive a snowmobile after all...Judge:\nHmmmmmm... Witness. Please, tell us everything you know right away next time.Bikini:\nWell. I'm not in the best of shape. What with my back and my age, you know.von Karma:\nQuite... There were indeed snowmobile tracks in front of the Main Gate. Here is a photograph.Judge:\nA snowmobile, eh... I see. Well, it certainly is an interesting theory...von Karma:\nThe tracks begin in front of Hazakura Temple... ...and run all the way to Dusky Bridge!Tracks Photo added to the Court Record.von Karma:\n...That solves your pesky little problem, yes? The Eagle River's current is quite swift, meaning that it doesn't freeze over in winter. Making it the perfect place to dispose of the murder weapon!Edgeworth:\n(Did she really go to the river to dispose of the murder weapon...?)Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth! ...Your cross-examination, please.Cross Examination-- Location of the Weapon --Bikini:\nI saw the murder at around 11 PM...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...You are sure about the time?\nBikini:\nYes... I was worried about it, after all.\nJudge:\nWhy was that?\nBikini:\nBecause I have a strong sense of responsibility. Especially at this time of year. The acolyte was being doused in freezing water at the time... I couldn't very well take it easy in the bath all night now, could I? So at 11, I decided to leave Hazakura Temple.\nEdgeworth:\n(Her estimation of the time seems reliable, at least.)\nvon Karma:\nPlease continue, Sister.Bikini:\nAnd after asking that it be reported, I went out to the Main Gate.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou asked Phoenix Wright to report the crime, correct?\nBikini:\nRight, right, the one who trampled me.\nEdgeworth:\n(It seems she is the type to hold a grudge...)\nBikini:\nThere isn't a phone in the Main Hall, so I sent him to the bridge.\nvon Karma:\nPhoenix Wright... He didn't even have his cell phone on him?\nEdgeworth:\nHe had forgotten it at home, apparently.\nvon Karma:\nWhat a naïve boy, as always! Not only do I always carry my phone, but I always have my whip in hand, too!\nBikini:\nAnyway, I was really scared... And it was taking him a while to get back... So I thought I'd go out by the Main Gate for a spell.Bikini:\nAnd there... I saw tracks! Tracks that indicated the snowmobile had been used!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nAs I recall, there was a snowmobile outside the Main Gate when I visited.\nBikini:\nThat's it. That's the only one we have. It'll run no matter how much snow falls!\nEdgeworth:\nNow, you're certain the snowmobile was there at the Main Gate when you arrived?\nBikini:\nYes, of course. It was parked in front of the gate.\nvon Karma:\nSo... she had already gone, discarded the murder weapon, and returned by that time.\nEdgeworth:\n(...I'm not sure if this is really relevant... What should I do...?)\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(...I need answers to every possible doubt.) The snowmobile in question... Was it still warm at that time?\nBikini:\nHuh? Huh? Huh? Huh? What do you mean? What do you mean?\nJudge:\nWhat do you mean, eh?\nvon Karma:\nWhat do you mean, Miles Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\n(...I'm playing to a slow crowd here.) It goes without saying that using a snowmobile will heat its engine. If it was still warm, then it means it was recently used.\nBikini:\nAh! I see! I never thought of that!\nJudge:\nHmmm, that's right! I overlooked that, too!\nvon Karma:\n...Of course you did.\nEdgeworth:\nThen answer the question please, witness.\nBikini:\n... I don't often go around touching hot engines...\nEdgeworth:\n...Hmm.\nBikini:\nHowever... Now that you mention it... There wasn't any snow on it.\nJudge:\nSnow...?\nBikini:\nYes. For some reason, only the snowmobile wasn't covered in snow...\nEdgeworth:\n(There wasn't any snow on it!? Curses!)\nJudge:\nIt seems highly likely that the killer did use the snowmobile then, eh!\nvon Karma:\nHow long does it take to get to Dusky Bridge by snowmobile?\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nStop here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(It looks very likely that the snowmobile is related to this case. I can't help but think that Iris used it... But for what...? I'd better hold off on this... for now.)\nJudge:\n...Well then, witness.\nJudge:\nHow long does it take to reach the bridge by snowmobile?\nLeads back to cross-examinationBikini:\nIt takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, but less than 5 using one of those!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nIn that case... why didn't you use it yourself? You could've spared yourself some walking.\nBikini:\nAh! There's a reason for that! Have we got a moment for me to explain?\nJudge:\nI think that's why the question was asked in the first place...\nBikini:\n...It was about a month ago. I was driving my beloved little snowmobile, happy as can be. I'd fetched some water and was heading back when I went and crashed into a tree! The tree and my back both went crunch. Just like that. Crunch.\nJudge:\nHmm... Crunch.\nBikini:\n...I haven't been able to find the courage to ride anything since then...\nBikini:\nAnyway, the killer must have used it!Bikini:\nMaybe they threw the weapon into Eagle River and came back while I was knocked out?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nRefresh our memory. How long were you knocked out for...?\nBikini:\nLike I said, somewhere between 10 to 20 minutes.\nvon Karma:\nIt's possible to get to the bridge and back in 10 minutes using the snowmobile...\nEdgeworth:\n...I have to concede that is more than enough time.\nvon Karma:\nIs that all you wish to concede, Miles Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n...Present Tracks Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I admit this photograph proves something.\"Bikini:\n...Iris could have done that. She can drive a snowmobile after all...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhile it would have been possible, time-wise... ...one element remains out of place here.\nJudge:\nOh? And what would this mystery element be?\nEdgeworth:\nThe killer's reasoning, Your Honor. \"Why did the killer do all of this?\" Why go to the Eagle River to dispose of the murder weapon when there are other methods?\nJudge:\nHmm... Too many unanswered questions! Your response, Ms. von Karma? Waaaaaaaah!\nvon Karma:\nTurning to me for help over the slightest thing! Why don't you think for yourself once in a while? ...Your Honor.\nJudge:\nWhaaaaat!?\nEdgeworth:\n(She's as over the top as always...)\nvon Karma:\nA-Anyway... Whatever the reason, the fact remains that the defendant could have done this! The murder weapon was disposed of in the river! Another point to me, Miles Edgeworth!Present Tracks Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I admit this photograph proves something.\"Edgeworth:\n(Another mystery to feed the fire... \"Was there any reason to go and throw away the murder weapon\"...? Luckily, there is surely a problem with this testimony. Now all I have to do is start poking holes in this flawed account...)Edgeworth:\nI admit this photograph proves something. It proves that the snowmobile was used on the night of the murder.von Karma:\nYou've finally accepted the inevitable, it seems... Miles Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\nHowever... If what the witness says is true, why is there only one set of tracks?von Karma:\nWhat do you mean...?Edgeworth:\nIris left Hazakura Temple, threw the weapon into the river, and then returned. If this was the case, then naturally there should be two sets of tracks in the snow! Those from heading out to the bridge, and those from coming back.Bikini:\n... Ah...! You're right!von Karma:\nHmph... You are forgetting one thing, Miles Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\n...?von Karma:\nOn the night of the murder, it was snowing. The tracks leading to the bridge were erased by the snowfall. This removes your precious contradiction, now doesn't it!Judge:\nI see! While she was at the river, the snow stopped... ...leaving just the return tracks in the snow.von Karma:\nWhat do you have to say now, Miles Edgeworth!Edgeworth:\n(Is there a flaw in her theory...? This idea that the snowfall covered one set of tracks...?)It's flawless.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...The tracks leading to the bridge were covered by the snow.\nEdgeworth:\nI do not have any evidence that can dispute this claim.\nvon Karma:\n...In which case, the rest is simple. Sister. Who was the only person who could have driven the snowmobile that night?\nBikini:\nWell... that would be...!\nvon Karma:\n...You can't hide it. I already know the answer.\nBikini:\n......... It could only be Iris.\nJudge:\nA-And the reason being...!?\nBikini:\nThere is only one key for the snowmobile.\nvon Karma:\nA key... that the defendant is responsible for!\nEdgeworth:\nWhaaaaat!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Now I don't feel like a clueless Puck Bunny! I understand everything! If the defendant did indeed use the snowmobile... ...which means that Iris is most definitely the murder--\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Your Honor! Please, wait a moment.\nJudge:\nWhat is it, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nThere is one gaping hole in Ms. von Karma's claim!\nJudge:\n... I'm not sure if I care for your response, Mr. Edgeworth. Next time, bring up whatever issues you have earlier. Do you understand!?\nEdgeworth:\nNngh... (I should have noticed it sooner...!)\nLeads to:\n\"The tracks to the river were covered by snow... What a nice theory.\"There is a contradiction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The tracks to the river were covered by snow... What a nice theory.\"Edgeworth:\nThe tracks to the river were covered by snow... What a nice theory. However, Ms. von Karma... That is impossible.von Karma:\n... Would you care to explain... ...why there is a rude index finger currently pointed in my general direction?Edgeworth:\n...No need. The evidence will do all of the talking for me.Judge:\nOn the night of the murder the killer went to, and returned from, Dusky Bridge... ...in order to dispose of the murder weapon. The outgoing tracks were erased by snow. ...Or so claims Ms. von Karma. Mr. Edgeworth! Present your evidence to the contrary, eh! Evidence that the outgoing tracks were not covered by snow!Present Weather Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWitness! Please tell us again what time it was when you witnessed the crime.\nBikini:\nLike I said! It was around 11.\nEdgeworth:\n...Of course, this means that the weapon was thrown away after that time, correct? On that note... Please take a look at this data. It is the weather report for Eagle Mountain on the night of the murder.\nJudge:\nThe... weather report...?\nEdgeworth:\nSnow started to fall at 7 PM... But it stopped at around 10:50.\nvon Karma:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nTherefore! When the Sister witnessed the crime at 11 PM... ...the snow had already stopped falling! It is impossible for any tracks made after that time to have been covered up!\nvon Karma:\nAaah!\nJudge:\nO-Order! Order!\nJudge:\nVery well then... It looks like Ms. von Karma's claim has been... snowed in. Waaaaaah!\nvon Karma:\n...It's too soon to be closing this trial due to snow! Miles Edgeworth! How pathetic of you to rely on the weather of all things!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nvon Karma:\nAnswer me this, then! When is a weather report ever correct!?\nJudge:\nAh, no, no no... You've got it all wrong. This isn't a forecast... This is... actual data... Gyaaaaah!\nvon Karma:\nForecast, data, all weather reports have some inaccuracies! It may have still been snowing in the vicinity well past 11 PM!\nJudge:\nHmmmm... It's true. We cannot be totally sure, eh!\nEdgeworth:\nW-What!? (How did she pull that off!?)\nJudge:\n\"It had stopped snowing at Hazakura Temple when the murder took place.\" ...You need to provide conclusive evidence of this.\nEdgeworth:\n(I've come this far... There's no turning back now.) ...Very well. I, too, cannot allow any doubt to remain concerning this testimony.\nvon Karma:\nHah... You can't back down, can you? Such a perfectionist, Miles Edgeworth!\nJudge:\nVery well then... Mr. Edgeworth! Where is your evidence that it had already stopped snowing when the victim was killed!?\n\n\n\nPresent Crime Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ultimately, it all comes down to one point.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nJudge:\n... Your response, Ms. von Karma?\nvon Karma:\nIt looks like... It is still snowing in your heart, too. Shivering in the cold, you are closing your eyes to the truth...\nEdgeworth:\n...!\nJudge:\nAnd to think you just arrived after a long, tiring flight from Germany. That was poetry. Pure poetry.\nEdgeworth:\n(This evidence is only going to freeze my case solid.)\nvon Karma:\nRespond! Miles Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nEven if it is snowing in my heart... At the time of the murder... it had already stopped snowing at Hazakura Temple!\nLeads back to:\n\"Very well then... Mr. Edgeworth!\"Present Crime Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ultimately, it all comes down to one point.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nHere is the evidence! What do you have to say, Your Honor...?\nJudge:\n... ...This reminds me of when I was a little hockey goon in training... When I was a child, I hoped for school to be canceled due to heavy snowfall. Perhaps, Mr. Edgeworth, it would've been better for you had court been snowed in. ...That's all this evidence says to me, in any case.\nEdgeworth:\n... Nothing else...?\nJudge:\nNothing else.\nvon Karma:\nOh dear... You seem to have missed, Miles Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nNngh...!\nEdgeworth:\n(According to the witness's testimony, the incident occurred after 11 PM... In which case... ...there has to be evidence that can undeniably prove something doesn't match up!)\nLeads back to:\n\"On the night of the murder the killer went to, and returned from, Dusky Bridge...\"Edgeworth:\nUltimately, it all comes down to one point. That being... Whether or not it was snowing in that courtyard when the victim was stabbed...von Karma:\nThat's right. But proving that is...Edgeworth:\nIncredibly easy.von Karma:\n...!Edgeworth:\nIf we want to know whether it was snowing or not, this photo will tell us everything. Of course, I am referring to the photo of the crime scene. As you can see... everything is covered with snow. ...With just one exception.von Karma:\nAnd that is...?Edgeworth:\nThe victim herself, Ms. Elise Deauxnim! Why is there no snow on top of her...? The answer is simple! It had stopped snowing when she was killed, that's why!von Karma:\nGnnngh!Edgeworth:\nIn other words! If the killer really did go to the Eagle River to dispose of the murder weapon... ...then in this photograph, there should be two sets of tracks!von Karma:\nAaaaah!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Just what are you... Gyahaah!von Karma:\nJ-Just what are you suggesting, Miles Edgeworth!?Edgeworth:\n(To be honest... I am not entirely sure myself. But...) This is simply what all of the facts point to. That night... someone used the snowmobile to leave Hazakura Temple. From the tracks left, it can be understood that they were heading for Dusky Bridge. At that time... it was still snowing.von Karma:\nOf course it was. Because those tracks were erased by the snow. (Changed from [Of course it was. Because those tracks were gone.] in the original release)Edgeworth:\nThen when this person returned to Hazakura Temple... ...the snow had stopped. Thus, the return tracks remained.Judge:\nHmmmmm...Bikini:\nCan I say something? This all sounds a bit fishy to me...von Karma:\n...What does, Sister?Bikini:\nThere is only one key for the snowmobile.Edgeworth:\n...!von Karma:\nFurthermore, on the night in question, we know that the defendant had it! The key was found in her room after the murder!Bikini:\n...Which can only mean, that night... Iris used the snowmobile to go to the Inner Temple...Edgeworth:\n(But... Iris said that she never went there... I should probably press on this point some more when I get the chance...)Bikini:\nThe snowmobile can't cross the suspension bridge... So, she must have left it on the Hazakura side of the bridge and crossed on foot.Judge:\n...That sounds right.Bikini:\nBut... What's odd is, when I left Iris and returned to Hazakura Temple... I didn't see anything near Dusky Bridge.von Karma:\nY-You must have just failed to see it, Sister.Bikini:\nMaybe... But when I made it back to Hazakura Temple... ...it was there, by the Main Gate... The snowmobile, I mean. I know what I saw. It was covered in snow, too...Edgeworth:\nB-But that... isn't possible!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order in the court! ...What does this all mean?von Karma:\n...Nngh...Edgeworth:\nSo then what was the snowmobile used for...? It wasn't taken by the defendant when she went to the Inner Temple. If it had been, then the witness couldn't possibly have seen it by the gate. Furthermore... it wasn't used by the killer to dispose of the murder weapon. If that was the case, there should be two sets of tracks in this photo. All we know is this... After it stopped snowing... someone used the snowmobile to return to Hazakura Temple!Judge:\nHmmmmmm...Edgeworth:\n(I never thought a simple snowmobile could cause so much trouble...)Judge:\n... I think we've learned all we can from this witness... (Changed from [I think we've arrived at this point due to the witness...] in the original release)Bikini:\nYes, yes. I've nothing more to add. I've told you everything -- everything that I know.Judge:\nBut then... that still leaves us with the same problem. (Changed from [Well then... That still leaves us with the same problem.] in the original release) If only there was someone... A witness who could testify to having seen the snowmobile!Edgeworth:\n(A witness, huh...)Judge:\nWas there no one out, walking perhaps, near Dusky Bridge on that night?Bikini:\n... I don't think that's likely. It was cold enough to freeze your ears off. Only an idiot would go out wandering in that. ...Unless they had something really important to do.Judge:\nHmmmm... That's a shame.Edgeworth:\n(Hold on... Something is coming to me... An idiot may well have gone wandering out on that sub-arctic night!) ...Your Honor! Actually... there just might be one individual who may be of help to us. (Changed from [I actually have an idea... There may be one individual able to help us.] in the original release)Judge:\nR-Really!?von Karma:\n...You know of someone who might have seen the snowmobile on the night of the murder...?Edgeworth:\nI don't know for sure if he saw it or not... But there are two things about him that do come to mind.Judge:\nWhich are...?Edgeworth:\nFirst... that he saw \"something incredible\" on the night of the murder.von Karma:\n...And the second being?Edgeworth:\nThis individual that I am thinking of went wandering outside on that cold night... In other words, he is our kind of idiot.Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth! Who is this idiot you're talking aboot!?Present Larry Butz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This guy must be a product of \"Jean-Luc de Laduc's Guide To Obnoxious French Painting\"...\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nJudge:\nJust what is the meaning of this, Mr. Edgeworth...? Are you saying that... this is the person who was near Dusky Bridge that night?\nEdgeworth:\nI-I did think so, however... Aaah!\nvon Karma:\nYou're the wandering idiot, Miles Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nCool off before you try to take me on again! Ungh...! (What was I thinking!? This is the perfect chance to drag him onto the stand!)\nJudge:\nHmmmm... Mr. Edgeworth. This individual... Did they really see the snowmobile that night?\nLeads back to:\n\"I don't know for sure if he saw it or not...\"Judge:\nThis guy must be a product of \"Jean-Luc de Laduc's Guide To Obnoxious French Painting\"...Edgeworth:\nThis is Larry Butz...

(I could tell them all about his designs for Iris... But it may cost us his credibility as a witness... Before I even call him.) He is, after all, an artist. He was, perhaps, searching for something in the snowy scenery that would move him. ...Although I cannot guarantee that this is the reason.von Karma:\nAnd so...? This unfortunate, unreliable-looking man... What exactly was it that he saw?Edgeworth:\nI intend to extract that from him, right here in this courtroom.Judge:\nSummon this youth as a witness immediately!von Karma:\n... I have no choice, do I?Edgeworth:\nI believe he is in the gallery for this trial. It will not take long to summon him.Judge:\n...Very well.Edgeworth:\n(Larry... You may have escaped me yesterday... But today I'm going to get everything out of you!)Judge:\n...The court will now adjourn for a 20 minute break. Ms. von Karma, please see to preparing the next witness.von Karma:\n...Understood, Your Honor.Judge:\nGood... Well then! Court is now in recess!To be continued.February 9, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Iris:\nExcuse me... Mr. Edgeworth? I'm not really sure what to say...Edgeworth:\nIris. We only have 20 minutes. There are two things which I need to ask you before we reconvene.Iris:\n...Alright. I'll help you any way I can.Edgeworth:\nFirst, about that night. You really didn't go to the Inner Temple, correct? The last witness claims to have met and talked with you in the Training Hall. Either you or Sister Bikini... ...is lying.Iris:\n... Mr. Edgeworth. It is just as I said yesterday. Until the incident occurred... I was in my own room, in Hazakura Temple.Edgeworth:\n...Very well. The second thing, then. That night, the temple snowmobile was used in between the time Sister Bikini... ...returned to the Main Hall and when she bore witness to the murder. Sometime between 10:30 and 11 PM that night. Were you the one who used the snowmobile?Iris:\n... There is only one key for the snowmobile. The only person who could have used it... was me.Edgeworth:\nSo it was you...! But... why? ...What made you go out to Dusky Bridge?Iris:\n... I'm sorry, Mr. Edgeworth.5 PSYCHE-LOCKSEdgeworth:\nIris...Iris:\nI can't... tell you about that... yet.Edgeworth:\n\"Yet\"...?Iris:\nNot until her safety is confirmed...Edgeworth:\nHer?Iris:\nThe safety of the acolyte...Edgeworth:\n(The \"acolyte\", huh... She's must be talking about Maya...) ... Iris. Look me in the eye and tell me the truth. Did you kill Elise Deauxnim?Iris:\n... No matter who or what may come... I could never take a life.Edgeworth:\n... (As I thought... no Psycholocks...) ...Very well. It is my job to get to the truth. You'll discover this for yourself soon enough.February 9, 11:36 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 7Judge:\n...Court will now reconvene. Ms. von Karma. Where is the witness...?von Karma:\nDuring the break, a man was detained for suspicious behavior in the gallery.Edgeworth:\nSuspicious behavior...?von Karma:\nHe was sketching something... Very intensely.Judge:\nDare I ask what the witness was sketching when he was detained?von Karma:\nHe drew a terrifying woman, armed with a demonic face and a vicious whip.Judge:\n... I can only presume that his intention was to capture you-- ...Aaaah!von Karma:\nAnyway, it's time to drag this pathetic excuse for an artist before the court! Laurice Deauxnim! I hope you're ready... Get in here!Edgeworth:\n(It would seem that whip is going to see plenty more use today...)Butz:\nOuch!von Karma:\n...Your sketch is in contempt of this court!Butz:\nH-Hey! I was just artistically rendering... Ou-Ouch!von Karma:\nYou tried to run away from the bailiff who was trying to hand you your subpoena, correct?Butz:\nL-Look! I'm nothing but a fledgling artist, training out in the mountains! I'm only down here in the city because I ran out of green paint. Well, to use the technical term for the color, \"viridian\".Edgeworth:\n...Larry... This isn't an art store, now is it...?Butz:\nI know! I graduated junior high, OK!? Look.

Just touching me will make you eternally unhappy!Judge:\n...Well then, let us proceed with the cross-examination. With no touching, thank you. We can delve into other details at a later time.Cross Examination-- What I Saw --Butz:\nI was at that lodge out in the mountains, looking up at the stars that night.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...\nJudge:\nWhat ever is the matter, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nThis one single statement is so full of contradictions... For a moment there, I thought I was going to collapse.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nvon Karma:\nSo, witness? Any idea as to where these contradictions in your testimony lie? Depending on your answer... I may let my whip have its way.\nButz:\nOK, give me a minute... Well, it was snowing that night so I couldn't possibly have seen the stars. That run-down shack is hardly a \"lodge\", is it...? And even if the stars could be seen, it isn't like I was there to look at them, right?\nEdgeworth:\n...\nvon Karma:\nSee? You can do it if you try.\nButz:\nHeh heh heh... Ou-Ou-Ou-Ouch!\nvon Karma:\n...There is only one issue here.

I went once every twenty minutes.\nEdgeworth:\nWhich means... ...you spent almost two hours at Heavenly Hall that night?\nButz:\nYou bet! Real love is about waiting with your heart in your hands!\nJudge:\nLove, you say...?\nEdgeworth:\nIt was this man's intention to summon the defendant to the small shack. ...Using this blackmail letter.\nJudge:\nB-Blackmail...!?\nButz:\nNo, no! That was simply a product of overflowing love... A-Agh!\nvon Karma:\nYou huffy, puffy, loosey-goosey excuse for a whimpering whining wuss of a witness!\nJudge:\nSo... what did you see? I hope for your sake you saw a snowmobile... You huffy, puffy, loosey-goosey excuse for a whimpering whining wuss of a witness, eh!\nButz:\nUm... well...

The treasured Kurain Village heirloom whose name means \"7 Branched Sword\". It is said that this sacred sword represents life itself. Though the branches may appear to be infinite, the choices limitless... ...like our destinies, the sword comes to but one end. One merciless point. And when the silver cord, the fragile thread that binds us to this world, is severed... ...the illusion is revealed and the implacability of fate is finally laid bare...February 6, 9:48 AMWright & Co. Law OfficesMaya:\nHey, Nick.Phoenix:\nYeah? What is it?Maya:\nYou know how I've got spiritual powers, unlike you?Phoenix:\nUm, sure... You are a spirit medium, after all.Maya:\nBut just like you, if I don't keep my powers sharp, they get dull, right?Phoenix:\nUm... I guess so, yeah.Maya:\nGlad you agree! OK, Pearly! You're up!Phoenix:\n(Pearls...?)Pearl:\nSo! That's why we need to go on a special \"Spiritual Hot Spot Tour\", Mr. Nick!Phoenix:\n...Huh? I'm lost. What's this magazine you're shoving in my face?Pearl:\nIt's the New Year's issue of \"Oh! Cult!\", Winter Spiritual Locations Special!Phoenix:\n...Oh. (Pearls looks so happy.)Maya:\n\"Maximize your spiritual powers with just one night of intensive training!\" ...Oh! It sounds too good to be true!Phoenix:\nI'll say. It sounds more like a scam to me.Maya:\nIt's at a spiritual retreat called \"Hazakura Temple\". It's way up in the mountains, and I bet it's nice and cold. ...Just perfect for training!Phoenix:\n(Now I definitely don't want to go...)Maya:\nYou know, I think I've heard of this temple before. It's a famous channeling dojo. It's hard for even real spirit mediums like us to make reservations up there!Phoenix:\nReservations...? For a temple? Are you serious?Pearl:\nDon't worry! I've already made special reservations, just for us!Maya:\nYeah! And I signed up for the \"Special Course\"!Phoenix:\nTh-That's nice. And the timing couldn't be better. ...Since we don't have a case right now anyway.Maya:\nAlrighty then! It's settled! Well, come on! Don't just stand there! Start packing your stuff!Pearl:\nYes, Mr. Nick! You'd better start packing your stuff!Phoenix:\nHuh...? M-ME!? Why do I have to go!?Maya:\nWell, we have to be accompanied by someone over 20 years old.Phoenix:\nHey! I don't have anything to do with spirit power. The only thing I can channel is a TV. ... So, um, is there a heated pool at this \"Hazakura Temple\"?Pearl:\nNo, but you can stand under a freezing waterfall!Phoenix:\n... Sorry, but I think I'll pass. I hate cold places.Maya:\nWhaaat!? No way! How can you be so selfish!?Pearl:\nCome on, Mr. Nick! Look at this place! Doesn't it look beautiful!?Phoenix:\nNope. Not going. I'm gonna be nice and toasty at home....... .................What the...!?Pearl:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Nick?Phoenix:\nLet me see that magazine! Th-This nun...Maya:\nIs she a friend of yours or something, Nick?Phoenix:\n(Th-This girl... I-It's...!)Dahlia:\nMy name is Dahlia Hawthorne. I just want to say... It's an honor for me to be here in your noble presence.Dahlia:\nHonestly, how can any woman ever count on you for anything? ...You disgust me!Phoenix:\nBut... It can't be! (She was found guilty and should still be in prison...)Pearl:\n...Mr. Nick?Phoenix:\n... I'll go.Maya:\nHuh...?Phoenix:\nHazakura Temple... I said I'll go.Maya:\nYay! Isn't that great, Pearly!?Pearl:\nYes! Oh, thank you! Thank you, Mr. Nick! You'd do anything for Mystic Maya, right? Even walk over burning coals, right!?\"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue received from Pearls.Phoenix:\n(Dahlia Hawthorne... I knew there was no way she could possibly be at that temple... But, I just had to be see for myself... ...who this \"nun\" really was.)February 7, 3:24 PMHazakura TempleMain GateMaya:\nBrrrrr... It-It-It's so c-c-cold here, Nick!Phoenix:\nMaybe you should put on something warmer for a change!Maya:\nW-W-Well, it's supposed to be c-c-cold... It's t-t-training. ...Ah-Achoo!Phoenix:\n(Her teeth are chattering so loudly, it's all I can do to make out what she's saying...)Pearl:\nWow, Mystic Maya! So this is the famous Hazakura Temple!Maya:\nP-P-P-Pearly... I-I-I-I... Ah-Achoo!???:\nWell, well, well... How nice to see you here. Welcome to our temple!Maya:\nOh...! Th-Th-Thank you... Ah-Achoo!???:\nOh my, my, my... Thank you for coming all this way. Come now, come now. You must have been cold.Phoenix:\nWhat's with the past tense...? We're freezing into human popsicles as we spea--!???:\nHo ho ho. Well, we are high up in the mountains after all. In any case, we shouldn't speak here. ...Please follow me inside.Maya:\nTh-Thank you. I was starting to think I would pass--???:\nOh! Yes, yes! I almost forgot to introduce myself.Bikini:\nI'm the head nun here at the temple. My name is Bikini.Maya:\nB-B-B-Bikini...!?Bikini:\nThat's riiight! Actually, that's my \"temple\" name. What do you think? It's a tradition to have one, and I wanted something that has a nice image to it. So I thought, \"Why not choose a bikini?\" Besides, it makes me seem younger. Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho!Maya:\nIt certainly does! Oh, I signed up for your \"Special Course\"!Bikini:\nWell, my, my, my. Quite brave of you considering how cold it is! Young people can be so reckless with their health! Don't blame me if you become one with those you channel. Wa ha ha! Ho ho ho!Pearl:\nR-Reckless...?Maya:\n\"Wa ha ha\"...?Pearl:\nMaybe you should take it easy tonight, Mystic Maya... We can come back another day.Maya:\nBut you went through all that trouble to get reservations for m--Bikini:\nYes, yes, yes, that's right! You've come all this way, so please, enjoy yourselves! There's still time before supper, so why don't you have a look around?Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nWhat do you think, Nick? Pretty awesome gate, huh?\nPhoenix:\nIt sure is... It looks pretty well maintained, too. This thing kinda puts your hometown to shame, Maya.\nMaya:\nYeah... Well, a lot of things have happened in Kurain Village. We used to be a lot richer, back when people hired us to perform channelings.\nPhoenix:\nOh, I see... But now the place looks a bit run down...\nMaya:\nHmm... I guess I was just born in the wrong time.\n\n\n\n\nMain Hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nThat looks like the Main Hall where we'll be staying tonight. From here, it looks like one of those ice hotels you always hear about!\nPhoenix:\n...They gotta have a heater or something in there, don't you think? I don't wanna die.\nMaya:\nI'm not worried, I brought my hot-water bottle.\nPhoenix:\nDid you bring one for me?\nMaya:\nWhat are you talking about, Nick? Who carries around 2 hot-water bottles?\nPhoenix:\n(Brr! If the cold doesn't kill me, the ice queen over here will finish the job...)\n\n\n\n\nBell tower\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nOh, look! It's a cute little bell tower! I absolutely love the sound of a giant bell!\nPhoenix:\nOh? So, which do you like better? That or the sound of money?\nMaya:\n...! ...... Sorry, but I'll take money for the win, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What are you apologizing for?\n\n\n\n\nSnowmobile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nOh look, it's one of those snow motorcycle things!\nPhoenix:\nMost people call that a \"snowmobile\", you know.\nMaya:\n\"Snow motorcycle things\", \"Snowblowmeal\". Same thing. Hmm... Too bad we didn't invite Desirée. I bet she could race like the wind on this \"Slowmobile\"! Or maybe she'd give me ride on this \"Blowsnowbile\".\nPhoenix:\nArgh! I told you, it's \"snowmobile\"!Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanneling dojo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUmm... So what's a \"channeling dojo\" anyway?\nBikini:\nOh my, my, my... You don't even know that?\nMaya:\nForgive him, Sister, for he knows not what he is saying.\nBikini:\nWell, well, well. Just call me Bikini and forget that \"Sister\" part. A channeling dojo is basically a spiritual power training ground. We have special holy items prepared here to help people boost their spiritual power.\nPhoenix:\nH-Holy items...?\nBikini:\nIf you train an entire evening surrounded by these items... Aaah. It's quite mysterious. The spiritual power of these items seems to envelop you. Wa ha ha ha.\nPhoenix:\n(Wow, she must have just gotten off the trolley from the land of make-believe...)\nMaya:\nUm, so what exactly is the \"Special Course\"...?\nBikini:\nYou must be incredibly devoted to be interested in that at such a young age! It's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant a spell... ...30,000 times! All while being showered in freezing cold spirit water.\nMaya:\nEh...?\nBikini:\nIt's February now, right? You have to be careful this time of the year... If you don't watch it, you'll catch pneumonia or maybe even die of hypothermia... So be careful, you hear? Wa ha ha. Ho ho ho. Ha!\nMaya:\nHow am I supposed to \"be careful\"...?\nPearl:\nOh no... I knew I shouldn't have signed Mystic Maya up for this...\n\n\n\n\nThe other nun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUmm, Sister... About this picture...\nBikini:\nWell, well. Look at that. I must say I look rather divine here, don't you think?\nPhoenix:\nOh, um, yeah. Unforgettable in every way.\nBikini:\nYou mean it? Oh, I knew it! Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho ho! The makeup was pretty tough, but Iris helped me out.\nMaya:\n\"Iris\"...?\nBikini:\nThe cute little girl in the photo. She looks just like me, doesn't she? We're just a small temple here, so she and I run the entire place.\nMaya:\nReally? That kinda sounds like fu--\nPhoenix:\nSorry to cut in, but...! This \"Iris\"... Where is she right now?\nBikini:\nOh! Just listen to you! You haven't come all the way up here just to find a girlfriend, have you?\nPearl:\n... *glare*\nPhoenix:\nNo, no, no! Th-That's not what I had in mind at all...\nBikini:\nAnyway, Iris is in the Inner Temple preparing for this evening.\nMaya:\nInner Temple...?\nBikini:\nYes, yes, that's right. Iris will be back this evening. Why don't you go have a look at the Main Hall for now? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha.\nPhoenix:\n(So she's in the Inner Temple, huh...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm, do you think you could take a look at this?\nBikini:\nI may not look like it, but I can tell you I'm very much in demand. And to be quite honest, I'm finding this a little difficult to say...\nPearl:\n...What IS she trying to say, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI think she's trying to say that she's busy.\nMaya:\nBut seriously Nick, what's the deal? Nothing has even happened yet and you're already shoving evidence into people's faces. You need to forget about work and relax a little.\nPearl:\nTry to have some fun, OK Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, you're right... (Sure. Pin the hypothermia on the lawyer is great fun!)February 7Hazakura TempleMain HallMaya:\nBrr... It's fr-freezing in here, too! Achoo!Pearl:\nHee hee. It reminds me of the Meditation Room in Fey Manor!Phoenix:\n...Pearls, you've been in an unusually good mood since we got here.Pearl:\nWell, kids are made of energy, you know!Phoenix:\nAs for you, Maya, you look like you're about to catch a bad cold.Maya:\nW-W-Well, I'm not exactly a little kid anymore, I guess. Ah-Achoo!Phoenix:\n(Nngh... Is she going to make it...?)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSliding doors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI bet the writing on these sliding doors are instructions for spirit channeling... Kinda like how we scribbled math formulas on the bathroom walls to remember them. Except we couldn't go to the bathroom during tests... And I can't read these walls.\n\n\n\n\nObjects on floor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere are straw zabuton cushions arranged around a hibachi brazier... I haven't seen a layout like this since I saw this really old Japanese movie on TV. ...If it wasn't for this hibachi, they'd probably freeze to death.\n\n\n\n\nAltar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's an altar. It looks a bit old, but someone does a good job taking care of it. Speaking of altars, I remember seeing one like this in Kurain Village last year. I guess they really do have something to do with spiritual power after all.\n\n\n\n\nMagatama on altar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere's a laughably large Magatama on the altar. If I can see Psyche-Locks with the tiny Magatama I've got... ...I can only imagine what kind of power this bad boy has under his hood!\n\n\n\n\nLeft corner near altar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's a stack of straw zabuton cushions. Maya told me this type of zabuton is called \"enza\"... I suppose if I'd never come here, I'd have missed out on all these new things.February 7Suspension BridgeMaya:\nWow! Look at this broken down old bridge, Nick!Phoenix:\nY-Yeah, and look at that big canyon below us.Maya:\nHey! There's a river down there! It looks like it's flowing real fast! ...What's wrong, Nick? You look like you've seen a ghost!Phoenix:\nI-I'm just not very good with heights...Maya:\nOh... Hey! I've got it! Maybe you should face your fear and try hurling yourself off the edge? You know! One... Two... Three... Jump! It might be just what you need to get over your fear of heights!Phoenix:\n...Yeah, death is a real good way to overcome phobias alright. Anyway, it sure looks like a rickety bridge.Maya:\nCan't argue there. That's probably why it's called, \"Dusty Bridge\".Phoenix:\nRead it again, Maya. It says, \"Dusky Bridge\".Maya:\nWell, it's practically the same thing.Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCliff on opposite side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like it's about 20 yards to that cliff over there.\nMaya:\nI guess that's where I'll be training tonight. Do you want to train with me, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nAnd do the Special Course? I think not.\nMaya:\nBut it'd be so great if you had spiritual powers, too! (Really? \"I see dead people\" sounds more like a cause for alarm to me...)\n\n\n\n\nWooden sign on left side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere's a narrow path going off in a different direction than that of the Main Hall.\nMaya:\nThe sign here is so old, the text seems to have vanished.\nPhoenix:\nThe path leads to a wooden staircase that goes down to the bottom of the canyon.\nMaya:\nOK, I'll write, \"wooden staircase\" on it then.\nPhoenix:\n...Do you really think that is necessary? You'd have to be blind not to see the stairs.\nMaya:\nWell, it can't hurt. Just pass me a pencil, OK?\nPhoenix:\nGraffiti is a crime, Maya.\n\n\n\n\nBridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! Why don't we hop across the bridge. It'll be fun!\nPhoenix:\nI'm not so sure... It looks like a bunny hopping across the bridge would destroy it.\nMaya:\nOK, Nick. Then let's try to find a cute little white bunny and test your theory.\nPhoenix:\n(That right there sums up the fundamental difference between sane and insane.)\n\n\n\n\nBoulder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSome letters are engraved into a roughly cut boulder.\nMaya:\n\"D-U-S-T-Y Bridge\", huh?\nPhoenix:\nIt says, \"Dusky\"! \"Dusky Bridge\"! OK?\nMaya:\nC'mon, Nick! Take a look at that bridge and tell me it's not supposed to be \"Dusty\"! This sign is obviously wrong, and I'm gonna fix it! Now give me a pencil, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nDo I look like a pencil holder to you?\n\n\n\n\nPublic phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nI can't believe there's a public phone here. Who would ever use it?\nPhoenix:\nThe people who live here, I guess. I doubt they have any real phones there.\nMaya:\nYeah, but it took like 20 minutes to walk here from the Main Hall! ... It would've been smarter of them to build the Main Hall here, don't you think?\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe you should work on channeling someone who makes logical sense, Maya.After clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate:February 7Hazakura TempleMain HallMaya:\nTh-Th-The Main Hall... I th-think it's even c-c-c-colder in here! Achoo!Pearl:\nAh! Mr. Nick! Do you smell that? It smells like meat and gravy!Maya:\nYeah, you're right! I guess it's pot roast for tonight! Yum!Phoenix:\n...Weird. I thought they would serve something a little more... well, traditional.Maya:\nWhat are you talking about, Nick!? You think monks and nuns just sit around eating rice gruel all the time!?Pearl:\nMystic Maya is right! Ooh! I hope there's mashed potatoes, too! I love mashed potatoes!???:\nHa ha ha... What a cute little acolyte! Greetings to all of you.Phoenix:\nOh... Um, hello. (Wow, this lady makes Maya look like a 6.8/10 on the weirdness scale.)Maya:\nYour outfit... Did you come here for the Special Course, too...????:\nHa, ha, ha... Unfortunately, no. Actually, I'm...Pearl:\nAaaaaaaaaah! Y-You're...! Y-You're...! You're Ms. Elise Deauxnim!Elise:\nYes, that's right... You know of me?Pearl:\nM-M-My name... My name is Pearl Fey! I-I'm your biggest fan!Maya:\nWho is she, Nick?Phoenix:\nHmm... I see it now... Zvarri! A fortune-teller...?Pearl:\nI-I've got all your books, Ms. Deauxnim!Elise:\nHa, ha, ha... What a sweet thing to say. And please, call me Elise.Phoenix:\nUm, \"books\"...?Pearl:\nMr. Nick, don't you know anything!? Don't you even know who this is?Phoenix:\nWell, um... ...An author, maybe?Elise:\nYes, and an illustrator. ...Of picture books.Maya:\nPicture books, huh? Oh, now I get it...Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElise Deauxnim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... I'm sorry I didn't know who you are. I don't get a lot of chances to really enjoy picture books.\nElise:\nIt's alright. I take no offense to that. My books are nothing but simple stories for children.\nPearl:\nAnd really beautiful pictures too, Ms. Elise! Your books always make me feel as if my heart has been purified.\nElise:\nHa ha ha... It makes me feel very happy to hear you say that.\nPhoenix:\n(I do have to admit... She certainly seems like a kind, sensitive lady.)\nPearl:\nMs. Elise won an award last year for her book, \"The Magic Bottle\"!\nElise:\nYes... A friend of mine secretly submitted a story I had written to a publisher. They liked it so much that they asked if it was alright to make it into a book.\nPhoenix:\nWow... It must have been a really great story.\nMaya:\n...Maybe I should try to write a children's book, too. If I do, you can secretly send it to a publisher for me, Nick.\nElise:\nRecently, I've accepted a sort of... apprentice you might say.\nPhoenix:\nAn apprentice?\nElise:\nHe calls himself Laurice... Laurice Deauxnim. I believe he's off doing some landscape sketches now... On Laurice's behalf as well, I'd like to thank you for your support.\nPearl:\nOf course, Ms. Elise! Anything for you!\nElise:\nHa ha ha...\n\n\n\n\nWhy come here?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPearl:\nUm... Why did you come to Hazakura Temple, Ms. Elise? Are you here... to do some spiritual training?\nElise:\nHa ha ha... No, that's not it. I'm actually here to gather materials for a new book I'm working on.\nPearl:\nWow! I-I can't wait to read it!\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls is completely taken with her...)\nElise:\nI wanted to do a book with a more Japanese feel to it this time.\nPhoenix:\n...So is that why you're dressed like you are?\nElise:\nThe children have a certain image of me in their minds. I don't want to disappoint them...\nPhoenix:\n(What can I say... She's really a sweet lady...)\nPearl:\nWow, Ms. Elise, you're dressed up like a mountain nun!\nElise:\nYes. The good people here were kind enough to let me borrow this... I'm wearing training clothes underneath my robe, as well.\nMaya:\n...I want a staff like that.\nElise:\nYou like the crystal sphere? It's real amethyst, you know.\nMaya:\nMaybe we'll find one like that up here on this mountain. Good luck, Nick! I know you'll find me one!Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMs. Deauxnim? What do you think about this?\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Do you think Ms. Elise is a suspect?\nPhoenix:\nHuh...?\nPearl:\nYou may be Mystic Maya's special someone, but I won't let you do this to Ms. Elise!\nPhoenix:\n(A suspect? Why would I suspect her of anything? It's not like anything's happened.)\nMaya:\nIsn't it cute, Nick? Pearly's getting all overprotective of her new friend.After clearing all Talk options:Elise:\nWell, you'll have to excuse me now... I have to go help with the dinner preparations.Pearl:\nWow! You mean you're cooking dinner tonight?Elise:\nThat's right. Would you like to help too, Pearl?Pearl:\nYes, yes! I want to help with whatever I can!Phoenix:\n(Pearls looks like she just won the lottery...)Maya:\nOh, I'll help too, then...Elise:\n...No, it's fine. Please don't worry about it. Feel free to relax and explore the area with your friend.Maya:\nHuh!? But...Elise:\n...Oh, yes! Please take this. I think it will be of help to you. It's a map of the area. We wouldn't want you to get lost now, would we?Phoenix:\n(The \"Inner Temple\"... There it is, on the other side of the bridge...) Well, if you insist, I guess we'll take this chance to go check out the other temple.Hazakura Temple Map added to the Court Record.Pearl:\nOK! I'll see you two later then! Remember! You're not allowed to fight!Maya:\nCome on, Nick! Let's go! At least we'll stay warm if we keep moving!February 7Hazakura TempleMain GateMaya:\nHuh? Where did Sister Bikini go?Phoenix:\nI guess she went to the Inner Temple... To go help that other nun out.Maya:\nOh, right... I think her name is... Iris?Phoenix:\nY-Yeah... That was it. (I want to find out who Iris really is, but I'm scared of what I'll find...)Maya:\n...?February 7Inner Temple GateMaya:\nWhoa, that bridge was shaking like jello in an earthquake.Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nAnd at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I bet. (Changed from [And at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I'd bet.] in the original release)Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nNot to mention the last part only had like one board left on it!Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nWhat's wrong with you? Your face is all green.Phoenix:\nC-Can you not pick on me for a second? I'm still trying to get over the shock that we made it safely across that death trap.Maya:\nYeah, I guess I'm a bit surprised, too... Yikes! That \"temple\" is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse at any time... (Changed from [Yikes! That 'temple' is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse anytime...] in the original release)Phoenix:\nI guess people don't use it too often. Is this really where you're going to train tonight?Maya:\nThat has to be it. It's kinda creepy around here... Like a ghost might jump out at you or something!Phoenix:\n(A spirit medium afraid of ghosts...? Isn't it ironic, don't you think?)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI don't care how much you pay me, I don't want to cross that bridge again.\nMaya:\nNo worries, Nick. No one is offering you any money.\nPhoenix:\nThat's because no reasonable person would call that pile of popsicle sticks a bridge! The latter half of it was nothing more than a few planks of wood and some string!\nMaya:\nHey, if we want to get back, we've got no choice but to cross it again, you know.\nPhoenix:\n... Maybe I'll just stay... I've always dreamed of living in a little shack in the woods.\nMaya:\n...Wow, you really are scared, aren't you?\n\n\n\n\nSuspension wire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nIt looks like this bridge is suspended by 4 of these wires.\nPhoenix:\n...They're reeeally thin. Shouldn't they be just a little thicker...?\nMaya:\nOh, stop it! You're such a worrywart, Nick! If the bridge were really going to collapse... ...I'm pretty sure the boards would break before these wires ever did!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nWhat's wrong? You're turning into an over-ripe avocado again.\n\n\n\n\nBuddha statues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nOh, wow! Look at these neat Buddha statues. Maybe I'll take one home with me.\nPhoenix:\nMaya!\nMaya:\nBut there are so many. They wouldn't notice if I took just one.\nPhoenix:\nAre you kidding? Of course they'll notice! What are you gonna do with one of those anyway?\nMaya:\nPut it in the office of course! We can trade that wooden statue in the office reception area for one of these!\nPhoenix:\n(You know, come to think of it, where did that wooden statue come from anyway...?)\n\n\n\n\nIncinerator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nHey! There's a giant robot buried in the snow!\nPhoenix:\n... Well, there's something buried in the snow, but... I think it's an incinerator.\nMaya:\nOh... Hee hee. But you've gotta admit it looks a lot like a robot.\nPhoenix:\nUm, sure... Anyway, I don't think it gets used much. It's looking pretty rusty.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Do you think this Giant Robo-cinerator can walk?\nPhoenix:\nI told you! It's not a robot! ...And it's not especially big either.\nMaya:\nBah, you have no imagination. I thought it'd be real neat if you had to beat it to advance.\nPhoenix:\n(A fight between a lawyer and an overgrown furnace? Who'd ever pay to see that!?)\n\n\n\n\nYellow gate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nHey! A half-opened gate! That's practically a welcome mat!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, except the sign on here says, \"No Entry\".\nMaya:\nUmm, Nick. Rules are made to be broken, you know.\nPhoenix:\n...You expect a lawyer to go along with that?\nMaya:\nOh, come on! You're such an old lady sometimes! Let's just go!\nPhoenix:\nDon't blame it on me when Sister Bikini puts a curse on you.\nMaya:\n... Now you've got me scared. Um, let's just forget about it, OK?\n\n\n\n\nWooden log on left\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nLooks like there's something written on it.\nPhoenix:\nI can't read it, but if I had to take a good guess, I'd say it says, \"Inner Temple\".\nMaya:\nWhat's the point of a sign if you can't read it? Must be tough for the mailman when he's delivering here.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess the sign is a good indication of how long this place has been here...)\n\n\n\n\nGate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nSo that's the Inner Temple up ahead, huh?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks kinda run-down.\nMaya:\nWell, it wouldn't be very temple-like if it was all bright and shiny.\nPhoenix:\nSo you're training here tonight, huh?\nMaya:\nYup! Then everyone'll see my spiritual powers!\n...Uuurrrgh...ggnngh...ggh...\nPhoenix:\nSounds like your stomach wants to show off its digestive powers instead...\nMaya:\nI wonder if that roast is ready yet?February 7Inner TempleTraining HallPhoenix:\nMan, look at this place... It's just a tiny, freezing-cold room. So this is where you'll both be training, huh...Maya:\nHuh? What do you mean, \"both\"? I'm the only one.Phoenix:\nReally? But I thought...Maya:\nPearly's just a little kid. She couldn't handle this kind of intense training.Phoenix:\n(So says the girl who I can barely hear over her teeth chattering...) (Changed from [So says the girl who I can barely hear over her bones chattering...] in the original release)Maya:\nAnyway... The real training room must be behind that door over there. Hmm... Yup, definitely getting the feeling it's back there. (Changed from [Yeah, I get the feeling it's back there, definitely.] in the original release)Phoenix:\n(Even I can sense that there's something supernatural about the cavern behind that door...) (Changed from [If only because the cavern behind that door is giving off a real supernatural feel...] in the original release)???:\nUm... Excuse me, but... Who are you...? ...Ah! ...Phoenix:\nY-You're...Maya:\nHi there! We're just looking around since we're going to be staying here tonight...???:\n...Maya:\n...? Is something wrong????:\nUh, er, no! It-It's nothing...Maya:\nI wonder why she spaced out like that. Don't you, Nick?Phoenix:\nUh... D-Did you say something, M-Maya?Maya:\n... Not you too, Nick...Iris:\nI... M-My name is Iris. I'm one of the nuns here at this temple.Maya:\nI'm Maya Fey. It's a pleasure to meet you!Iris:\nThe pleasure is mine... ... Oh, er, please excuse me! I have some... um, chores to attend to.Maya:\nShe sure is beautiful... and a bit spacey, I guess... I guess she's just not used to talking with urban sophisticates like us.Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nNick?Phoenix:\n(That girl... It-It can't be, but...)Maya:\n...?Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDresser drawers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nLook at this antique dresser. I wonder if there's anything valuable inside. Let's have a look... Hmph... Nothing! Just a bunch of clothes. Hey, Nick.\nPhoenix:\n... Huh! Oh, sorry. I was just... thinking.\nMaya:\nOh? About Iris, I bet! Looks like you've been bitten by the love bug, Nick!\n\n\n\n\nMattresses\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere are a bunch of musty looking blankets and bedding sets piled up here. I wonder why they're even here in the first place? \nMaya:\nIt's because all spiritual training is done under the supervision of a nun. I wonder if Sister Bikini is planning to sleep in here while I train? \nPhoenix:\n(But if they sleep, what's the point of having them here in the first place...?)\n\n\n\n\nSacred cavern entrance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nThe actual training area must be on the other side of this door. I wonder what it's like. Phooey... It's locked. Come on, Nick! You know you want to open it for me!\nPhoenix:\n...I can't.\nMaya:\n... You've been in kind of a bad mood lately, haven't you, Nick? ...Zvarri! I know what it is! I-R-I-S.\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nHa ha ha ha ha! ♪Iris and Nick, sitting in a tree!

Why did you scream like that!?\nMaya:\nTh-This scroll...! It-It's my mother...\nPhoenix:\nWh... Whaaaaaaaat!?\nMaya:\n...It's Misty Fey. The Master of the Kurain School of Channeling...\nPhoenix:\nAre... Are you sure?\nMaya:\nYes... The crest at the top of the scroll... That's the special mark of the Master of our tradition.\nPhoenix:\n(So that's what the mark means...)\nMaya:\n...\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it?\nMaya:\nN-Nothing... It's just that... I last saw her over 15 years ago... If it wasn't for that crest... I wouldn't have even known it was her. My own mother... And I can't even recognize her face.\nPhoenix:\nMaya...\nHanging Scroll added to the Court Record.\n\n\n\n\nHanging scroll (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's a hanging wall scroll showing Maya's mother, Misty Fey. It's not that old. That crest at the top is the official mark of the Master. I wonder if this temple has some sort of connection to \nthe Fey family...\nMaya:\nI think it does, actually. Supposedly, it was founded by a branch family member of the Kurain School.\nPhoenix:\n(I'll have to ask Bikini in more detail when I get the chance... About Maya... And the Fey family in general.)After examining hanging scroll in Inner Temple - Training Hall:February 7Dusky BridgeMaya:\nWhew, we managed to make it across Dusty Bridge.Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nNick, you look green.

Sorry...???:\nHey, you! ...Wait up!Maya:\n...? You think he's yelling at us?Phoenix:\nHe must be. There's no one else around...???:\nWould you mind moving? You're standing right in my way. ...

I just... I wanted to start over again! With a clean slate!\nMaya:\nA clean slate...?\nButz:\nYou remember don't you? Last time?\nPhoenix:\n(The Mask☆DeMasque case...)\nButz:\nAfter that, I started to realize I didn't like this guy known as Larry Butz! And that's when I came across it... The book of destiny!\nMaya:\nThe \"book of destiny\"...? Do you mean...?\nButz:\n\"The Magic Bottle\"! By Ms. Elise Deauxnim! It's so beautiful... So moving... So... So gentle. My heart felt cleansed! I-I was saved!\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe I should buy a copy of \"The Magic Bottle\"...)\nMaya:\nWow, Larry would make a great book salesman! I really want to get that book now, too!\n\n\n\n\nElise Deauxnim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nShe's the most wonderful person I've ever met!

You must have some kind of ulterior motive, right?\nButz:\nWh-What're you talking about!? I don't... I don't trust anyone anymore... Especially not women!\nMaya:\n...Talk about a bad case of denial.\nPhoenix:\nAnyway... Can you even draw well enough to make a picture book?\nButz:\nArt isn't only about technical skill, you know. It's also about having a pure heart!\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's why I'm asking. Can you draw well enough to make a whole book?\nButz:\n...! Hmm... Now that you mention it... I wonder.\nMaya:\nIt looks like you still have some doubt in your heart.\nButz:\nIt's true, I do... But when I first saw her, I felt it! Something inside me ended, and something else began.\nMaya:\nOh Larry, it sounds like you've fallen in love with Ms. Elise Deauxnim!\nButz:\nNo! Y-You're wrong! It's not her...

Yeah, that's right. Of course I have! I have... basically. But...\nMaya:\n\"But\"...?\nButz:\nBut... Iris is different. I feel like...

I'll see you all tomorrow, I guess!Bikini:\nIris, please ring the bell at 10:00 for lights out, alright?Iris:\nYes, Sister Bikini.Bikini:\nAnd then, after you ring the bell, I want you to come join us at the Training Hall.Iris:\nI understand, Sister Bikini.Phoenix:\n(Maya and Bikini really seem excited about this training thing tonight...)Elise:\n...Well, Pearl? What are you going to do tonight?Pearl:\nWell, umm...Elise:\nIf you'd like, you can come to my room. Perhaps we can read some books together.Pearl:\nR-Really!? I'd love to! I, umm...

So, for example, how do you read this?Elise:\nIt says, \"gravely\"... That's kind of a tough word.Pearl:\nOh! OK! And what about this word?Elise:\nThat's another tough one. It says, \"roast\".Phoenix:\n(What kind of a book is she reading anyway...?)Pearl:\nWell, I'm going to go wash the dishes and help clean up. I'll go visit you when I'm done, Ms. Elise!Phoenix:\n(Well, not much to do except head to my room and huddle under the covers, I guess...)February 7, 9:12 PMHazakura TempleMain HallPhoenix:\n(Ugh...

Ah, Ms. Deauxnim! Are you going to use the bathroom, too?Elise:\nUm, no. But... Have you seen Pearl?Phoenix:\nNo... Not since after dinner.

You're Sister Iris, right?\nIris:\n...Yes.\nPhoenix:\nS-So... um, when did you come to Hazakura Temple?\nIris:\n... I don't remember. Ever since I was a small child, the temple has been my home.\nPhoenix:\nSo you've never left?\nIris:\nWell, I don't have any family left to take care of me... Sister Bikini... I've come to think of her as my real mother, as it were.\nPhoenix:\nAh, I see... But you... Didn't you go to college? ...And maybe enroll with the Ivy University Literature Department?\nIris:\nNo, I never had an interest in going to a big university like that... My training is all the education I need.\nPhoenix:\nI... I see...\nIris:\nBut... Once in a while, when I get the chance, I make a trip to the nearby town. I can use a computer and a cell phone, too.\nPhoenix:\n... (That's not exactly something worth bragging about...

I heard it's for training to increase your spiritual power or something like that.\nIris:\nIt must seem awfully crazy to normal people like you.\nPhoenix:\nWell, I have to admit it is a whole different world up here...\nIris:\nI'm glad to hear you say that.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nIris:\nTalking with dead people... Who does it help anyway? ...I hate it.\nPhoenix:\nR-Really?

I would like you to have this.Phoenix:\nBut this is your hood...Iris:\nIt has the power to protect you from evil spirits.Phoenix:\n(Come to think of it, Sister Bikini was wearing one of these, too...)Iris:\nI pray for your safety on this dark, cold night.Iris's Hood received from Iris.Iris:\nI'm sorry, but I must bid you goodnight.Phoenix:\nWait a minute, Sister Iris...Iris:\nY-Yes...?Phoenix:\nJust now, you called me by my name...

Maya... and Iris's Bikini... ...Huh? Say something, Edgey!Edgeworth:\n...Before I came here, I stopped in at the hospital where Wright is. I believe I have a better understanding of the situation than you, at this point. The murder victim was the picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. She was found by Wright and the head nun. The suspect is the temple's younger nun. Then later, while Wright was crossing the bridge, it broke and he fell into the river. The hospital says that he'll need at least 2 days of bed rest.Butz:\nY-Yes! Th-That's right! You got it! B-But they arrested her... My sweet little Iris!Edgeworth:\n(And here I was, convinced HE was the one the police had arrested...) However... I still don't understand what these two items are for.Butz:\nWhat are you talking about?Edgeworth:\nThey're things Wright gave to me when I was leaving his room. (This is the first... He said some nonsense about being able to see into people's hearts with this... And the other... He couldn't possibly be asking what I think he is... could he?)Butz:\nI'm begging you! Iris's trial starts tomorrow! With Nick out of the picture, you're all I've got left! You're the only one that can represent her!Edgeworth:\n... What did you just say?Butz:\nYou know! REPRESENT! DEFEND! What were you expecting!? Why do you think I called you anyway!?Edgeworth:\n...I'm a prosecutor, Larry. A prosecutor. Do YOU understand what I'm saying? A prosecutor is a lawyer who...Butz:\nDon't talk to me like a kid! I graduated from junior high, you know! Don't worry about it! I promise I won't tell!Edgeworth:\nBut I...Butz:\nI mean, I heard a paper badge had no problem fooling an entire court before!Edgeworth:\n(...How could this country's judicial system have fallen into such decay!?)Butz:\nPlease, Edgey! At least listen to her... Listen to Iris's side of the story!Edgeworth:\n(So Wright wasn't joking when he gave me this badge after all...)Iris:\nThank you for coming. ...My name is Iris.Edgeworth:\n...Edgeworth. Miles Edgeworth. I don't know if I can be of any help, but... ...I will at least hear what you have to say. ...About the murder.Iris:\nUm...Edgeworth:\n...?Iris:\nM-Mr. Wright! H-H-How is he? Mr. Laurice said that he... That he might even die...Edgeworth:\n... Fortunately, he will be fine. (Larry, you moron! How could you say something like that!?) He was badly bruised when he hit the water, but otherwise he is unharmed.Iris:\n... Thank goodness...Edgeworth:\nBut, he's caught some kind of nasty cold.Iris:\nA cold...?Edgeworth:\nHe's running a high fever and is drifting in and out of consciousness.Iris:\n...Edgeworth:\n(I must be imagining things. This woman... I feel like I've met her before...)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurveillance camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe camera is glaring at me. \"If something glares at you, it's only polite to return the favor,\" is what I was taught. ...\nIris:\nUm... Is something bothering you?\nEdgeworth:\n...Hm? Oh, e-excuse me.\n\n\n\n\nGuard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe guard is glaring at me. \"If something glares at you, it's only polite to return the favor,\" is what I was taught. ...\nIris:\nUm... Are you alright, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n...Hm? Oh, e-excuse me.Move\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Going to a crime scene is akin to entering a jungle teeming with dangerous beasts. Before he goes there, a hunter needs to make sure he has plenty of ammunition. And in my case, that \nammunition is called, \"information\".Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nPardon me... Iris. I would like to ask you something, if you don't mind. I have the distinct feeling you and I have met before...\nIris:\nI-It must be your imagination, Mr. Edgeworth. After all... I hardly ever leave Hazakura Temple.\nEdgeworth:\nHazakura Temple? What's that?\nIris:\nIt's a place where those who wish to boost their spiritual power come to train. You need to undergo some very difficult training to release your inner spiritual power.\nEdgeworth:\nSpiritual power...? Did you go to that temple for that reason as well?\nIris:\nNo... I don't have any spiritual powers. I don't need them.\nEdgeworth:\nIn that case, what are you doing at that temple then?\nIris:\n... I... I've committed some sins. Sins that I need to pay for. That's why I'm there, and why I continue to train... To purify my soul.\n\n\n\n\nThe night of the crime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI want to ask you about last night... The night of the crime.\nIris:\nAlright... I helped to clean up after dinner, and then went back to my room at about 8:00. Later, I left my room to ring the lights out bell at 10:00.\nEdgeworth:\nBell...?\nIris:\n...We ring it at the same time each night.\nEdgeworth:\nI see... And then?\nIris:\nA-And then...\nEdgeworth:\n...?\nIris:\nI was told to go to the Training Hall, but... I went back to my room... and stayed there...\nEdgeworth:\nWhy didn't you go to the Training Hall like you were asked to?\nIris:\n...I-I was frightened.\nEdgeworth:\n(\"Frightened\"...?)\nIris:\nSo I just stayed in my room and meditated... until the murder happened.\nEdgeworth:\n(There's more to her story.  I just know there is. Maybe  I should dig a little deeper.)\n\n\n\n\nFrightened? (appears after \"The night of the crime\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou were asked to go to the Training Hall on the night of the murder?\nIris:\nYes...\nEdgeworth:\nHowever... You didn't go. Because you say you were frightened. What exactly were you so frightened of?\nIris:\n...!\n\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Wh-What in the world!?)\nIris:\nUm... Is there something wrong?\nEdgeworth:\n...I'm sorry. It's nothing. (It looks like she's not aware of them herself... These must be what Wright was talking about... The \"Psycholocks\"! I believe he said that I need to present this \"Magatama\" item to do something...)\nIris:\n...?\n\n\n\n\nFrightened? (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nI... I don't like to walk alone at night. And, last night was...\nEdgeworth:\nWhat about last night?\n\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n\nIris:\nEr, oh... nothing. It's rather silly...\nEdgeworth:\nSo there was something special about last night, hmm?\nIris:\nNngh...\nEdgeworth:\n(It looks like I have no choice but to break these locks...)\n\n\n\n\nAny idea? (before clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night?\nIris:\n...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed.\nEdgeworth:\nSpiritual power...?\nIris:\nYes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example...\nEdgeworth:\n...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science. I don't believe in \"spiritual power\".\nIris:\nYes... I understand. Most people don't.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd I am certain that the thing that killed the victim was a human. So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim?\nIris:\n... No. I'm not the one who took her life.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... (That was foolish of me... It's not as if I can know for certain if she is telling me the truth...)\n\n\n\n\nAny idea? (after clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night?\nIris:\n...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed.\nEdgeworth:\nSpiritual power...?\nIris:\nYes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example...\nEdgeworth:\n...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science. I don't believe in \"spiritual power\".\nIris:\nYes... I understand. Most people don't.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd I am certain that the thing that killed the victim was a human. So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim?\nIris:\n... No. I'm not the one who took her life.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... (Those Psycholock things aren't appearing... I suppose that means I can believe that she's not lying.) ...Heh.\nIris:\nWhat's wrong?\nEdgeworth:\n(I can't believe what I'm thinking... And here I just finished saying that I don't believe in spiritual power...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nIs that an attorney's badge?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, this belongs to Wright.\nIris:\nReally?\nEdgeworth:\nI'm actually a prosecutor.\nIris:\nOh...! Then why do you have a defense attorney's badge pinned on your lapel...?\nEdgeworth:\nWell, you see... I, um... I borrowed it.\n\n\n\n\nHanging Scroll\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWho is the woman on this hanging scroll?\nIris:\nWell, I don't know the details, but... I've heard she's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique.\nEdgeworth:\nM-Master?\nIris:\nYes. Mystic Misty. She was a great spirit medium. ...That's what I've heard. I also heard that she went missing over 15 years ago.\nEdgeworth:\n... Spirit mediums... There's no such thing anyway...\nIris:\nMr. Edgeworth...?\nEdgeworth:\nI know all about them... They're nothing but frauds!\nIris:\n...?\nEdgeworth:\n(She doesn't know anything about it, of course... But there was a time, 17 years ago, when I met the \"Master\" myself...)\n\n\n\n\nIris's Hood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nThat's called a \"Demon-Warding Hood\". ...I gave that to Mr. Wright last night.\nEdgeworth:\nHe was wearing this when I saw him at the hospital today.\nIris:\nIt's an important item for protecting acolytes from evil spirits.\nEdgeworth:\nIf it's so important, then why did you give it to him?\nIris:\nLast night... I felt... something... I felt that something terrible was about to happen... I... I didn't want Mr. Wright to fall into its grip.\nEdgeworth:\n(Well he wound up falling into something much deeper and colder... I probably shouldn't say that out loud, though. Thank god for inner monologue.)\n\n\n\n\n\"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\n...I was against the idea of our temple appearing in that magazine. I was afraid that... this type of a tragedy might occur.\nEdgeworth:\nIn that case, why did you allow them to run an article about you?\nIris:\nIt was Sister Bikini... She's actually rather fond of attention... Surprisingly so.\nEdgeworth:\n(She certainly does look rather happy in this photo...)\n\n\n\n\nPhoto of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nThat's Mystic Elise Deauxnim. She's a picture book author, or so I've heard.\nEdgeworth:\nDoes she come to Hazakura Temple often...?\nIris:\nNo... This was her first time. It's just that...\nEdgeworth:\n...?\nIris:\nShe was a very important visitor.\nEdgeworth:\nIs that so?\nIris:\nYes, Sister Bikini told me, \"Be certain not to offend her.\"\nEdgeworth:\n(The victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim... The prosecutor's office still doesn't have much information about her it seems...)\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix Wright profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nMr. Wright... How bad is his cold?\nEdgeworth:\nWell his fever is very high. As a result, he's rather confused. He's worried about Maya, who is still trapped in the Inner Temple... ...And he's quite worried about you as well, it seems.\nIris:\n...Really?\nEdgeworth:\nYes... Naturally, once he recovers, I'll pass the baton back to him.\nIris:\nNo... Don't... I'm sure that Mr. Wright wouldn't want that... He wouldn't want to defend me.\n\n\n\n\nLarry Butz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nOh... That's Mr. Laurice.\nEdgeworth:\n...I'm sorry? Who did you say it was?\nIris:\nLaurice Deauxnim. He is Mystic Elise's apprentice, I think.\nEdgeworth:\n(Alright... Now who exactly is this guy...?)\nIris:\nHe's a very sincere, hard-working person.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nIris:\nUm... Did I say something wrong, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nE-Excuse me. I was temporarily at a loss for words. (Take a trip... Come home... Be thrust suddenly into bizarro world...)\n\n\n\n\nIris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nYou want to know about me? There's not much to tell, I'm afraid.\nEdgeworth:\nJust let me get one thing straight. You were raised at Hazakura Temple, correct? And yet, somehow, you seem to know Wright.\nIris:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nSo you two must have crossed paths somewhere.\nIris:\n...No, Mr. Edgeworth. Whomever it was... ...it couldn't have been me.\nEdgeworth:\n(What is that supposed to mean?)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nI'm sorry... I don't leave the temple grounds very often... So I don't know very much about the outside world.After clearing all Talk options:Edgeworth:\nHmm... It appears that's about all that you can tell me.Iris:\nThank you very much for listening to my story.Edgeworth:\n...I visited Wright at the hospital before coming here. He asked me to take care of you...Iris:\n...M-Me?Edgeworth:\nYes, at the trial tomorrow... He asked me to defend you.Iris:\n... If Mr. Wright has that much faith in you, Mr. Edgeworth... ...Then I will gladly entrust my fate in your capable hands.Edgeworth:\nBut before that, I have one question.Iris:\nYes?Edgeworth:\nDo you know Wright?Iris:\nEr... Wh-Why would you ask that?Edgeworth:\nWhenever you came up in our conversation, he would begin to act a little... strange.Iris:\n... Mr. Edgeworth... What is Mr. Wright to you? (Changed from [Mr. Edgeworth... Are you his friend?] in the original release)Edgeworth:\n...He is a very dear and indispensable friend. (Changed from [Friend? Well... In a sense, yes.] in the original release)Iris:\n... It was 5 years ago... That's when I... That's when I... deceived him.Edgeworth:\nYou \"deceived\" him...?Iris:\nI heard that he was... in a lot of pain after what happened. I know what a weak person I am. That's why... That's why I thought it was best if he never saw me again. I wanted him to just forget about me, without learning the truth.Edgeworth:\n... Well, if you ask me, Wright is still suffering... And until he learns the truth, I don't think he will ever be able to truly recover. ...Iris. It's not too late. You should go to him. ...Tell him the truth.Iris:\n...Edgeworth:\nI'll defend you, but only if you agree to that one condition.Iris:\n... Alright, Mr. Edgeworth... I promise.Edgeworth:\n...Very well. I'll do everything in my power to get you an acquittal. (That's enough information gathering for now. I should head to the crime scene...)February 8Dusky BridgeEdgeworth:\n(It sure is cold alright... So this is it... Dusky Bridge...)???:\nOh, wow! It's you, Mr. Edgeworth! (Changed from [Ahem! M-Mr. Edgeworth!] in the original release)Edgeworth:\nNngh... Detective Gumshoe. (Changed from [Urk... Detective Gumshoe.] in the original release)Gumshoe:\nLong time no see! It's been about a year? ...Or has it been longer?Edgeworth:\nIt doesn't matter, Detective. What does matter is why you're shuffling around up here.Gumshoe:\nOh, ouch! ...And there's that sharp left jab! (Changed from [Oh, ouch! ...And there was a sharp left jab!] in the original release) Well, I'm happy to see you anyway, Mr. Edgeworth!Edgeworth:\nLet me guess... You were transferred by HR to the local precinct? (Changed from [Let me guess... You were transferred into another section at work.] in the original release) A wise decision. The vast amount of nothing up here should be quite easy to guard. (Changed from [A good choice. The vast amount of nothing up here must be quite easy to guard.] in the original release)Gumshoe:\nI heard you were back in the country and arranged to come all the way out here! Everybody was real nice. They even let me take charge of the investigation, sir.Edgeworth:\n(...Gumshoe indeed! Like gum on your shoe, he's impossible to get rid of!)Gumshoe:\nI'm supposed to report on the details of the crime scene, sir! Anyway! Here I am! Detective Dick Gumshoe! Reporting for duty!Edgeworth:\n...Great. Um, thank you, Detective.Gumshoe:\nI thought Prosecutor Godot was gonna get here before me. That guy's a real mystery, I tell you!Edgeworth:\n(...Prosecutor Godot?)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCliff on other side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt looks like a pretty good distance to that far cliff.\nGumshoe:\nYeah... It's gotta be around 100 yards or so.\nEdgeworth:\n... Detective... That's not even CLOSE to a hundred yards.\nGumshoe:\nWell... I gotta admit I'm not very good at judging distances.\nEdgeworth:\n(It's about 20 yards or so. And impossible to cross without a bridge, it seems...)\n\n\n\n\nWooden sign on left side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThere's a little shack down that way called, \"Heavenly Hall\".\nEdgeworth:\nA shack...?\nGumshoe:\nIt's like a run-down doghouse for losers that can't bear the freezing drafts of wind... Kinda reminds me of my apartment, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nThe name \"Heavenly Hall\" makes it sound like a palace...\nGumshoe:\nGiving a hovel a great name is a crime itself! I'd call it false advertising! By the way, the name of my apartment complex is \"Compton Castles\"...\nEdgeworth:\n...That's not such a great name, if you ask me.\nGumshoe:\nWell, it's not such a great apartment either, sir.\n\n\n\n\nBridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo this is the bridge Wright tried to cross?\nGumshoe:\nPretty reckless, if you ask me.\nEdgeworth:\nI'm amazed he survived the fall from up here...\nGumshoe:\nYeah, he's one lucky guy, sir. Now I see how he manages to win his cases in court. Blind luck.\nEdgeworth:\n(I think dumb luck suits Wright just a bit better.)\n\n\n\n\nBoulder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSome letters are wildly engraved into a roughly cut boulder. \"Dusky Bridge\"... It certainly is an appropriate name.\nGumshoe:\nYou need to get some glasses, Mr. Edgeworth! That sign says, \"Dusty Bridge\". I can see how you read it wrong, though, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nYou're the one who needs glasses, Detective. Try reading it one more time.\nGumshoe:\n... Ah! You're right! It's \"Dusky Bridge\" after all! ... I guess whoever wrote this made a mistake!\n\n\n\n\nPublic phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nHey! It's a public phone! You don't see a lot of these anymore!\nEdgeworth:\n...That's true.\nGumshoe:\nSince we've got one here, why don't we take a photo as a memento!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, um, sure. Why not?\nGumshoe:\nOh, darn it! I don't have a camera with me! ...I'm gonna go buy a disposable camera! I'll be right back, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n(What's so special about public phones, and why is he so fascinated by them...?)Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened (before visitng Main Hall)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case...\nGumshoe:\nIt's simple!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, simple is as simple does, as they say.\nGumshoe:\nOh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing!\nEdgeworth:\nA witness...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that Bikini lady.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Bikini lady\"? Here? On this freezing cold mountain?\nGumshoe:\n...Well, you should talk to her yourself if you want the details, sir.\nEdgeworth:\n(I may have to talk to this \"bikini lady\"... I mean, \"decisive witness\" myself...)\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened (after visitng Main Hall)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case...\nGumshoe:\nIt's simple!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, simple is as simple does, as they say.\nGumshoe:\nOh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing!\nEdgeworth:\nA witness...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that Bikini lady.\n\n\n\n\nDusky Bridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo this is the bridge that Wright fell through?\nGumshoe:\nYup! I can't imagine being that reckless myself... \"Look before you cross,\" is how it goes, right? Or was that \"leap\"...?\nEdgeworth:\nAnd? Is there something on the other side?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, some old building they call the Inner Temple... But we can't get over there without a bridge, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat...?\nGumshoe:\nNobody lives there, so it's usually not a problem... But someone was at the Inner Temple doing some training and now they're stuck there.\nEdgeworth:\nYes, I heard that from Wright. It's Maya Fey.\nGumshoe:\nOh no... Her again...? Anyway, the air's really turbulent right now so we can't do an aerial extraction. No one's gonna be able to reach the Inner Temple until tomorrow, sir.\nEdgeworth:\n(Will she be alright in this cold...?) So how did this bridge burn down anyway?\nGumshoe:\nWe're almost 100% sure it was lightning.\nEdgeworth:\n...Lightning?\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor Godot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo who is this Prosecutor Godot? I've never heard of him.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, he's a new guy... Showed up after you left the country! He's a complete rookie, but nobody can say a bad word about the guy.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat kind of a man is he?\nGumshoe:\nHe just became a prosecutor recently, but he's good, sir. Real good.\nEdgeworth:\n(If he's so good, how is it that I've never heard of him...?) Is he the lead prosecutor on this case?\nGumshoe:\nYou bet he is! After all, \"you know who\" is right in the middle of it.\nEdgeworth:\n\"You know who\"?\nGumshoe:\nPhoenix Wright, of course! For some reason, Godot has really got it in for Mr. Wright!\nEdgeworth:\nOh?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, he seems to have some kind of a grudge.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd what would be the cause of this grudge...?\nGumshoe:\nI dunno... Maybe he made fun of his mask or something.\nEdgeworth:\n(None of this is making any sense. I'd better look into this Godot myself.)\n\n\n\n\nLightning (appears after \"Dusky Bridge\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning?\nGumshoe:\nYup. Last night it snowed for the first time in 3 days. It's a little unusual for lightning to occur during a snow fall like that... But according to the weather data, lightning definitely struck.\nWeather Data added to the Court Record.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm, I see... This is a very detailed weather report... Almost too detailed... It even has the exact time that the lightning struck the bridge...\nGumshoe:\nOh, that? We got that information from the witness's testimony.\nEdgeworth:\nSomeone actually saw the lightning hit the bridge? Who is this witness?\nGumshoe:\n... Sorry. I'll go ask one of the local cops later, sir.\n\n\n\n\nLightning (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning?\nGumshoe:\nYup. Last night it snowed for the first time in 3 days. It's a little unusual for lightning to occur during a snow fall like that...

I'll go ask one of the local cops later, sir.Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nHuh? What's that thing doing on your lapel, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n...Is it really that odd?\nGumshoe:\nYou bet it is, sir! A prosecutor wearing a defense attorney's badge? That's like a detective with a license to kill!\nEdgeworth:\n(Does this little thing hold that ominous of a meaning...?)\n\n\n\n\nMagatama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHave you ever seen this thing before...?\nGumshoe:\nHey, thanks a lot. I was getting kind of hungry! ...*chomp!*\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What are you doing, Detective!?\nGumshoe:\nAck! ...I thought it was some kind of candy that would fill me up, sir. Lately I've been feeling so hungry all the time...\nEdgeworth:\n(Nngh... Maybe his salary has been cut just a little too much...?)\n\n\n\n\nPhoto of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThere's a lot we don't know about this victim... We don't know her real name, her background... We don't know anything really.\nEdgeworth:\nThat's rather odd... If she was trying to hide her identity, why would she become an author?\nGumshoe:\nI'll bet it was just one of those things. You know... She probably never expected to get so popular.\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix Wright profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nWhenever something happens, this guy always shows up like he hasn't got a care. In fact, you know what...? Every time he shows up, I always wonder the same thing. \"Maybe somehow he's actually the cause of all these incidents!\"\nEdgeworth:\n(I wonder if Gumshoe has realized it yet... But you could say the exact the same thing about him!)\n\n\n\n\nDick Gumshoe profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYour face is more drawn out than the last time I saw you over a year ago.\nGumshoe:\nR-Really? I thought so!\nEdgeworth:\nNo, wait... It's not so much \"drawn out\", as \"weary and tired\", or maybe just plain old \"thin\".\nGumshoe:\nI thought that too, sir. My salary's been kinda on the low end... So yeah, my food options have been kinda non-existent. Off-brand chicken soup, off-brand spaghetti, off-brand bread... That sort of stuff.\nEdgeworth:\nI thought you were really into instant noodles last year...?\nGumshoe:\n...I got really sick of the stuff after a while, sir.\n\n\n\n\nLarry Butz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nHe's supposed to be Ms. Elise Deauxnim's apprentice or something.\nEdgeworth:\n...I see.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, he drew a nice portrait of me.\nEdgeworth:\n...That's nice.\nGumshoe:\nBut he made me pay him 50 cents for it.\nEdgeworth:\n...I'm sorry about that.\nGumshoe:\n... You don't seem very interested in him, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\n...I really don't want to talk about him. That's why.\n\n\n\n\nIris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI feel like I've seen this girl somewhere before! She wasn't from a prior case, was she?\nGumshoe:\nNope, can't be. We did a database search with her fingerprints and came up with nothing.\nEdgeworth:\nI see... (I just can't shake this nagging feeling...)\nGumshoe:\nWell, everyone knows that you are quite popular with the ladies, sir... Maybe she's an old girlfriend that you sent to Dumpsville when you were younger.\nEdgeworth:\nD-Detective! Where did you hear such nonsense from!?\nGumshoe:\nI didn't hear it from anyone. It's just sorta how I imagine you to be... sir.\nEdgeworth:\n(...D-Do I really inspire this sort of frothing desire from the female masses?)\n\n\n\n\nGodot profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI usually hear about promising young prosecutor candidates while they're still in school. But I've never seen or heard of this person.\nGumshoe:\nI gotta admit... He's puzzling alright. He just appeared one day, big mug of steaming coffee in his hand...\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... He sounds like an interesting man...\nGumshoe:\nYeah... The whole prosecutor's office is really into double espresso macchiatos lately.\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nLook, I'm just your everyday, simple detective.

After all, I saved his life.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is that supposed to mean?\nButz:\nIf I hadn't called for help so quickly, he would have died. It's no surprise though. I used to be a security guard.

If you ask nicely, I might give you a peek, big boy. Wa ha ha ho ho ho!Gumshoe:\nUmm... Mr. Edgeworth? This is the head nun, Sister Bikini... She's the witness.Edgeworth:\n... Why didn't you tell me that earlier!? This is exactly why your salary keeps on getting cut!Gumshoe:\nNngh... My stomach is already growling in protest...Bikini:\nSo... Um... What's the latest about my beloved Iris!?Edgeworth:\nWell, first... I want to hear what you know.Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWalls or sliding doors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere's flowing script written everywhere on the walls.\nGumshoe:\nMan, I'd bet you'd have awful nightmares if you tried to sleep in here.\nBikini:\nThis is our Main Hall, so it's protected by a variety of magic spells and charms... They're all designed to prevent evil forces from entering.\nGumshoe:\nSo if I slept here the uggie-woogie-boogieman wouldn't hunt me down for eternity? Alright!\nEdgeworth:\n(Does this guy think about anything other than eating and sleeping...?)\n\n\n\n\nObjects on floor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nOh! It's a warmed cat box! But where are all the cats?\nEdgeworth:\n...It's called a \"hibachi\". It's for heating the room.\nGumshoe:\nOh! Look at all these ancient straw frisbees!\nEdgeworth:\nThose are a type of \"zabuton\" cushions called \"enza\"!\nGumshoe:\n... Why are you giving me such a hard time? Huh, Mr. Edgeworth? Why?\nEdgeworth:\nBecause learning something new might actually be a good thing for you, Detective!\n\n\n\n\nAltar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt's an altar with a giant Magatama enshrined on it.\nGumshoe:\nThere are lots of candles lined up on it, too. You know... I haven't had a birthday party for myself in a while...\nEdgeworth:\nMaybe you should blow out those candles over there to make up for that.\nGumshoe:\nMr. Edgeworth? Would you mind singing \"Happy Birthday\" to me?\nBikini:\nS-Stop that! Cut that out! Please don't blow out the altar candles!\n\n\n\n\nMagatama on altar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...That thing sure casts a strong presence over the whole room.\nBikini:\nThis is the \"Lesser Magatama\". It's a precious heirloom containing a great many souls.\nGumshoe:\nHuh...!? This is \"lesser\"!? What is the \"greater\" one like?\nBikini:\nThe \"Greater Magatama\" is displayed in the Main Room of Fey Manor. It was supposed to be shown at the Treasures of Kurain exhibit... But, it was so large that they couldn't bring it through the doors.\n\n\n\n\nLeft corner near altar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(There are more enza cushions in the corner of the room.) ...What's that white piece of paper sticking out from under that stack...?\nGumshoe:\nHmm...

Here you are, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nIt looks like an old manila envelope...\nGumshoe:\nEeeeeeeeeeaaaah!!\nEdgeworth:\n...What is it, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nTh-This... This could be it! An ultra important clue! A super-special clue!\nEdgeworth:\n...I suppose I should read it myself then.\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like a letter addressed to Sister Iris. \"tonight at 10 at Heavenly Hall. ... ...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed.\"\nEdgeworth:\nTh-This sounds like a blackmail letter...!\nNote to Iris added to the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\nNice going there, Mr. Edgeworth! Why can't I ever find clues like that!? You're an ultra-important prosecutor!!

After dinner, the two of us went to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple.\nEdgeworth:\n(She must be talking about Maya...) Approximately what time was that...?\nBikini:\nI suppose it was about 9:00 when we left here. Training lasts all night long. It's extremely exhausting. The channeling dojo's Head Nun must be in attendance at all times to keep watch.\nGumshoe:\nWow, you're right! That does sound exhausting!\nEdgeworth:\nDetective, this is no time for flattery.\nGumshoe:\nSorry.\nEdgeworth:\nSome time around 11:00, you witnessed the incident in the courtyard. But your duty was in the Inner Temple. Why did you come back here?\nBikini:\nHmm... The way you're staring at me, I'm starting to get goosebumps! Ha ha ha ho ho!\nEdgeworth:\n(Nngh... I'm starting to get goosebumps myself, but for a decidedly different reason.)\nGumshoe:\nHo ho, you get the chills pretty easy, don't you Mr. Edgeworth?\n\n\n\n\nWhat you saw\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAlright then... I'd like you to tell me exactly what you saw in the courtyard.\nBikini:\nIt must have been past 11:00. Ah! No! I can't say it! It-It's too much for my poor heart!\nGumshoe:\nHey! Calm down, lady! L-Let go of my tie!\nBikini:\n...I saw two people! One of them was lying on the ground... Th-The other one was stabbing her from the back... with a sword!\nEdgeworth:\nDid you see this criminal with your own eyes?\nBikini:\nI didn't want to believe what I was seeing...! ...But it was Iris!\nEdgeworth:\nYou must have been quite shocked.\nGumshoe:\nOf course she was! Try putting yourself in her shoes! It'd be like if you were stabbing Mr. Wright smack in the middle of a courtroom! And I happened to witness it from the witness stand! ...I'd be pretty shocked too.\nBikini:\nI know it sounds insane... But that's what I saw. And when I finally realized what I was seeing, I screamed, and then... I passed out.\nEdgeworth:\n(...Unfortunately for us, her testimony seems to be pretty solid.)\nBikini:\nHowever... The idea of Iris doing such a foul act seems... unnatural.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Unnatural\"...?\nBikini:\nThe girl I know simply isn't capable of this sort of foulness...\nEdgeworth:\n(...I wonder what she means by that?)\n\n\n\n\nWhy return? (appears after \"The night of the crime\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAs the head nun, it's your duty to stay with the acolyte at all times, correct?\nBikini:\nYes, that's correct. I know I may look strong, but the truth is... I've got a bad lower back.\nEdgeworth:\nA bad lower back...?\nBikini:\nYes, it's especially bad in the winter. So bad that I can't even lift a bucket. Do you remember how cold it was last night? My bad back felt as stiff as frozen glass. I just wanted to take a nice hot bath to ease my aching back... That's why I returned to the Main Hall.\nEdgeworth:\nSo you left the disciple all alone?\nBikini:\nDon't be ridiculous! I would never do that! That's why I ordered Iris to the Inner Temple after she had rung the bell for lights out.\nEdgeworth:\n(Yes, but she never went to the Inner Temple, did she? So did this head nun actually see Iris there? (Changed from [Did this head nun even see Iris?] in the original release) I think I'd better try to get some more details...)\n\n\n\n\nThe acolyte (appears after \"What you saw\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo who is this acolyte that was to train at the Inner Temple...?\nBikini:\nHer name is Maya Fey... I treated her very badly, I'm ashamed to say. And after she went through the trouble of signing up for the Special Course...\nGumshoe:\n\"Special Course\"?\nBikini:\nIt's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant 30,000 times...\nEdgeworth:\nYou don't mean to tell me she's still doing that over at the Inner Temple, do you?\nBikini:\nNo, no, no. Of course not! You don't have to worry about that one little bit. Last night, we still hadn't started the training session itself.\nEdgeworth:\nWell, um... That's good to hear.\nBikini:\n...Oh! Dear, dear! There's one thing I forgot to tell you.\nGumshoe:\n...Uh-oh, I don't think I like the sound of this.\nBikini:\nDo you know that small girl? I believe she is Mystic Maya's little sister.\nEdgeworth:\n(Maya has a little sister...?)\nGumshoe:\nOh, you mean little Pearl! That's Maya Fey's cousin.\nEdgeworth:\nLittle... Pearl...?\nBikini:\nI thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after we'd finished with dinner cleanup... (Changed from [I thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after cleaning up dinner...] in the original release) But I haven't seen her at all since late last night! She's nowhere to be found!\nEdgeworth:\nY-You mean she...!? She was with the victim!?\nBikini:\nIt's all the fault of my stupid, creaky old back!\nEdgeworth:\n(A little girl who was with the victim on the night of the murder... is gone!)\nGumshoe:\nAs they say... \"The plot thickens!\"Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagatama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nTh-That's...!

You don't look it, but now I can see you're a real fan of the occult!\nEdgeworth:\nExcuse me?\nBikini:\nOh, of course this piece couldn't possibly be real, but to have such a nice replica... Clearly, you are a big fan of the Kurain Tradition!\nGumshoe:\nW...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me!\nEdgeworth:\n(I should have known better than to show this thing around...)\n\n\n\n\nHanging Scroll\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nHuh... Ahh! Well, well, well... Look what you've found! That's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, Mystic Misty Fey!\nEdgeworth:\n\"Fey\"...\nBikini:\nIt's been nearly 20 years since Mystic Misty's disappearance. Apparently, she intended to pass on the Master title to her daughter.\nEdgeworth:\nWho is this daughter?\nBikini:\nWell, I myself am part of a branch family of the Fey clan. But even I am not privy to information concerning the main family...\n\n\n\n\nIris's Hood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nWell, well, well! That's a Demon-Warding Hood! Acolytes are highly susceptible to possession by evil spirits, you know. That's why we always wear these for protection.\nEdgeworth:\nOh, I see...\nBikini:\nWhat are you waiting for? You won't get any protection just by holding it, you know! Put it on already!\nEdgeworth:\nNo! I can't...! I was just...!\nBikini:\n... Ha ha ha ho ho ho!\nGumshoe:\nHo ho ho! It's like it was made just for you, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean by that, Detective!?\nBikini:\nIt looks absolutely marvelous!

Absolutely.\nBikini:\nUp until recently, we've avoided exposure in such magazines. But this time we had our reasons...\nEdgeworth:\nIs that so? For exampl--?\nBikini:\nHa ha ha ha ha!!!

You're scary!\nBikini:\nWith that stupid 5 o'clock shadow and that stupid old coat of yours... It's too bad that you weren't the one that disappeared!\nGumshoe:\n... ...Why does she have to take it all out on me?\nEdgeworth:\n(Her anger does seem a little... manufactured.)\n\n\n\n\nNote to Iris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nDo you know anything about this old, crumpled-up letter?\nBikini:\n... Is that addressed to Iris?\nGumshoe:\nYup, it clearly says \"To Iris\" on it.\nBikini:\nI can't believe it... That girl doesn't have any secrets from me...\nEdgeworth:\n(Ah... So Sister Bikini didn't know anything about it...)\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix Wright profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nThis man... His face betrays a life of suffering and great weariness of the world.\nEdgeworth:\n...Um, sure.\nBikini:\nBut even so... I can't believe this guy actually jumped into the river! Think of all the fun things he might have enjoyed if he had just lived... Relentless spiritual training alone is no way to lead a complete life, huh...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n(It sounds like she's got some major regrets she's dealing with... Hmm... Perhaps I should let Gumshoe explain Wright's situation to her for me...)\nGumshoe:\nH-Hey! Don't look at me like that! Do you own dirty work! ...Sir!\n\n\n\n\nLarry Butz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nThis is Mystic Elise's apprentice, is it not? I think he might have a bit of a crush on me... Sweet boy at any rate.\nGumshoe:\nHuh?\nBikini:\nOh, I don't blame him. Sister Bikini understands the temptations of young men.\nEdgeworth:\n...Sure.\nBikini:\nBut I'm afraid it wouldn't be proper to abuse my position. I am head nun, after all. But, in return, I did allow him to draw a portrait of me.\nEdgeworth:\n(I pray it was a pose that maintained your modesty. For everyone's sake...)\n\n\n\n\nIris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou said you went with Maya to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple last night. Did you happen to see Iris while you were there?\nBikini:\nOf course I saw her. I told her to meet us after ringing the 10:00 bell for lights out.\nGumshoe:\nSo you're saying Iris came to the Inner Temple then?\nBikini:\nOf course she did. Iris has always been a good, obedient girl. After that, I had Maya begin her training ceremony.\nEdgeworth:\n(But that doesn't fit with Iris's story at all... She said that she never went to the Inner Temple!)\nGumshoe:\nAs they say... \"The plot thickens!\"\n\n\n\n\nBikini profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nIt's all my fault... Me and my stupid back! Mystic Elise has been murdered, an important acolyte is trapped... ...and a little girl has been lost!\nGumshoe:\nYou know you really shouldn't be so negative. It creates bad karma...\nBikini:\n...Quite right. I need to do some more training myself, I think...\n\n\n\n\nMaya Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nShe's a very important visitor, you know! An honored acolyte!\nEdgeworth:\n\"Honored\"? How so?\nBikini:\nThe Fey name is synonymous with the Kurain Channeling Technique. Therefore, she must be a spirit medium of great power indeed.\nGumshoe:\nNow that you mention it, one year ago... ...there was a case that was about the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique!\nEdgeworth:\n...Detective. I detest talk of supernatural drivel. I suppose now you'll say she has midi-chlorians?\nGumshoe:\nHo ho ho. So it gives you the creeps, huh, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n(...That's got nothing to do with it.)\n\n\n\n\nPearl Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nOh, this poor girl... Where could she have gone...?\nGumshoe:\nWell, we checked out her home and she's not there.\nBikini:\nAnd she's nowhere in the vicinity of the temple either...\nEdgeworth:\n(Which means... ...there's only a few other possibilities as to where she could be.)\nGumshoe:\nAh! Do you think maybe she fell off the bridge and was carried downstream...!?\nEdgeworth:\n... Why do you have to be such a pessimist, Detective!?\nGumshoe:\nNngh... I was just trying to think like you, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\n(Ironic. I became a pessimist only after I had the pleasure of working with you!)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nUmm, about this here...\nBikini:\nHmm... Let me see... Well, as you may know... In order to see reality for what it truly is... ...we strive to break our attachments to much of the transient, material realm. I guess you could call me an \"immaterial girl\"!\nGumshoe:\nI guess she lives in an immaterial world, huh Mr. Edgeworth?Main Gate (before clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nI'm just no good with people like her.

Sure.\nEdgeworth:\nI don't care how you feel about her personally... ...just tell me what you know about her and how she's related to the case.\nButz:\n... Don't you think you're expecting a little too much of me? I'm just a 25 year old jobless bum trying to be an apprentice artist!

Are you really gonna defend that nun, Iris, at the trial tomorrow?Edgeworth:\nYes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitment. (Changed from [Yes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitments.] in the original release)Gumshoe:\nWell, in that case... I've gotta be careful... Gotta make sure I don't leak the prosecution's whole investigation...Edgeworth:\nDon't worry about it, Detective. Just keep your mouth closed and I think most of it will flow out on its own.Gumshoe:\n... You got it, sir! I'll make sure it flows out like water from a tap! (Changed from [Roger, sir!

You're right! But I'm pretty sure the Main Hall didn't have a 2nd floor.\nEdgeworth:\nHazakura Temple was built on a steep part of the mountain. The front and back of the Main Hall are on different levels.\nGumshoe:\nOh... That makes sense...

Let's see if we can summarize what we've learned so far.\nGumshoe:\nOK! Let's take a look at the map. ...According to the testimony of Sister Bikini, the head nun... ...right after they'd finished dinner, she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple. (Changed from [...she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple right after dinner was finished.] in the original release) At 10 PM, after ringing the bell for lights out, Iris went to the Inner Temple. When she got there, Bikini had her take over while she went back to Hazakura Temple. After taking a hot bath to soothe her back... ...Sister Bikini witnessed the murder in the courtyard! If you want more details, you should ask Bikini herself in the Main Hall.\nEdgeworth:\n(The Inner Temple, huh...? I'd like some more information about that place...)\n\n\n\n\nTomorrow's trial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe trial begins tomorrow, but who's the prosecutor?\nGumshoe:\nI'm pretty sure it's that Godot guy, but... ...nobody can get a hold of him, so they're looking for a replacement.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean...?\nGumshoe:\nIt's really weird. All of a sudden, no one can reach him! Hmm, I wonder if the rumors are true. Maybe since Mr. Wright caught a cold and won't be defending, he just lost interest.\nEdgeworth:\nI intend to appear in court in the role of defense lawyer. However... I would be quite unhappy if it came out that I'm actually a prosecutor.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, I can see why. But I'm not the one you have to worry about... I think the real problem is gonna be that judge...\nEdgeworth:\n...Yes, he certainly would remember my face, even after such a long absence. That's why I requested another judge preside over the case. We've only met each other once. There's a good chance he won't remember me at all.\nGumshoe:\nY-Yeah, but... what about the prosecutor? Everyone in the prosecutor's office must know you! Wouldn't it be a problem if someone there made a big stink, sir?\nEdgeworth:\nThere's no need to worry. I pulled a few strings and arranged for a prosecutor of my own choosing.\nGumshoe:\nWow, Mr. Edgeworth... I had no idea you had such a powerful string to pull!\n\n\n\n\nInner Temple (appears after \"What happened\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this Inner Temple that Maya was supposedly training at...?\nGumshoe:\nAccording to Bikini, it's an old building they use for training the acolytes. It's on the other side of Dusky Bridge.\nEdgeworth:\n(The bridge that burned down, huh...) Is there anything else on the other side of that bridge besides the Inner Temple?\nGumshoe:\nNope, not a thing.\nEdgeworth:\nNothing?\nGumshoe:\nThe other side is surrounded by cliffs on all sides... In a way, it's kinda like a little island out there.\nEdgeworth:\n(So the only thing there is the Inner Temple...)\nGumshoe:\nI hear it's not the kind of place a person could survive in.\nEdgeworth:\n(Please be alright, Maya...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictim's Staff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nOh, so I think I might have already told you about this, but... The truth is... When I was a little kid...\nEdgeworth:\nYou wanted to become a wizard, right?\nGumshoe:\nHey, that's amazing! How did you know that!? So? What do you think? I'd make a really great one, don't you think?\nEdgeworth:\nWe just had this conversation a little while ago, Detective!\n\n\n\n\nShichishito\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThis sword represents the multiple branches that life can take, all ending as one.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... I've never heard that one.\nGumshoe:\nYou know what I think about sometimes? What kind of life would I have had if I hadn't joined the Homicide Division.\nEdgeworth:\n...So you think about that kind of thing too, huh?\nGumshoe:\nOf course I do. I think about it a lot. Me as a traffic cop. Me as a detention officer. Me as the Blue Badger...\nEdgeworth:\n(...I guess he doesn't have any plans to leave the force.)\n\n\n\n\nBikini profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThis is the witness who saw the crime take place out there in the temple courtyard. I'm pretty sure it's gonna be her testimony that'll be key to this case, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nSo you mean she's going to be a witness in the trial tomorrow...?\nGumshoe:\nOf course! A nun is as trustworthy as you can get! We got this one in the bag! ... Oh. I-I mean, I've always been on your side, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! So yeah, this is a pretty tight spot we've gotten ourselves into, huh!?\nEdgeworth:\n(Now I understand why Wright is always breaking into a cold sweat...)\n\n\n\n\nMaya Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI wonder if Maya is alright? I could never show my face to Wright again if something were to happen to her.\nGumshoe:\nAww, it'll be OK. If that ever happens, you can just show him my face. How's that...?\nEdgeworth:\n...\nGumshoe:\nAck! Um, I didn't mean it like that, sir! It was just a silly little joke!\nEdgeworth:\nI wonder if there is another way to get across to the other side? The support wires for the bridge are still intact, correct?\nGumshoe:\nThat bridge is almost 20 yards long... I know I may look like it, Mr. Edgeworth, but I'm no super hero.\nEdgeworth:\n(In any case, I just hope Maya is alright...)\n\n\n\n\nPearl Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat about Pearl...? Has no one seen her at all since last night?\nGumshoe:\nSeems that way... Apparently, she hasn't gone back to Kurain Village either, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nBut it's true that she was with Elise Deauxnim at some point last night?\nGumshoe:\nNo doubt about it. Ah...! Y-You mean that maybe whoever killed Ms. Deauxnim also...!?\nEdgeworth:\nD-Don't jump to any crazy conclusions!\nGumshoe:\nOooooouuuch! ...You sure have one mean punch, Mr. Edgeworth! It's down-right fierce!After clearing all Talk options in Dusky Bridge, clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate, clearing all Talk options and examining left corner near altar in Hazakura Temple - Main Hall, and clearing all Talk options and examining staff and Ami Fey statue in Hazakura Temple - Courtyard:February 8Detention CenterVisitor's RoomIris:\nAh...

Where is it on this map...?\nIris:\n...It's around here. To get there, you must follow a small path down from Dusky Bridge...

And yet, Sister Bikini says she met with you at the Inner Temple that very night.\nIris:\nB-But I... I didn't go there! I didn't go to the Inner Temple last night.\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm...

That's why I'm committed to searching until I have those answers. Now then, is it really true that you didn't go to the Inner Temple last night...?\nIris:\nY-Yes, I swear... I already told you that.\nEdgeworth:\n...Yes. You said you didn't go because you were frightened.\nIris:\n...Th-That's right.\nEdgeworth:\nIf that's the case... ...then the obvious question is, \"What were you so afraid of?\"\nIris:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nIris...

Whatever it is... ...there is one person you didn't want your secret told to!\n\n\n\nPresent Phoenix Wright profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Phoenix Wright...\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWell, Iris?\nIris:\n...Mr. Edgeworth. Is it just possible that maybe... ...you yourself have a deep, dark secret in your heart?\nEdgeworth:\n...! Why do you say that...!?\nIris:\nAs they say, it takes one to know one.\nEdgeworth:\n(How could she have known about that...? Is she peering into my soul!?) ...It's true that there is a deep-seated darkness in my heart. However, the only way I can get rid of it is to fully uncover the truth!\nIris:\nYou mean... the truth behind my secret?\nLeads back to:\n\"Unfortunately, I don't know the exact nature of your secret yet.\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nPhoenix Wright...\nIris:\nAh...!\nEdgeworth:\nYou mean something to Wright, it seems... And I can tell he holds a special place in your heart as well. That's why you didn't want him, of all people, to know your deep, dark secret. Well? What do you have to say?\nIris:\n... I should've expected as much... Especially from a friend of his...\n\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nUnlock Successful\n\n\n\nNote to Iris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis letter... It appears to be addressed to you.\nIris:\n... I think it's someone's idea of a joke, Mr. Edgeworth. That's why I threw it away.\nEdgeworth:\n(She's not giving me a straight answer for some reason. I'm going to have to find someone else who can give me more information about this.)\n\n\n\n\nShichishito\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nI-Is that the murder weapon?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, it is. Have you ever seen it before?\nIris:\nY-Yes. Mystic Ami was holding it... in the courtyard...\nEdgeworth:\n(And apparently, the head nun witnessed the whole sad affair... She saw you stabbing Ms. Elise Deauxnim with this very sword last night...)\nIris:\n...?\n\n\n\n\nLarry Butz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nOh... That's Mr. Laurice. He's a very sincere, hard-working person. He was even kind enough to draw a portrait of me.\nEdgeworth:\n(Knowing Larry... ...this woman is exactly the type that he would fall in love with at first sight.)\n\n\n\n\nBikini profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...I'd like to ask you about Sister Bikini, the head of Hazakura Temple.\nIris:\nShe raised me as if she were my real mother.\nEdgeworth:\n\"As if she were your real mother\"...?\nIris:\nI was left at Hazakura Temple when I was just a small child. And she's taken care of me ever since.\nEdgeworth:\nForgive me for sounding rude, but what about your family?\nIris:\n... I'm sorry, but I'd rather not talk about this.\n\n\n\n\nMaya Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nOh... This is the woman who was to undergo training last night. She seems like a very strong, reliable woman.\nEdgeworth:\n...

She's cute as a button! And she seems to really love mashed potatoes and gravy!\nEdgeworth:\n...Oh?\nIris:\nShe even said she was going to have the leftovers for dinner the next night... And then she took the leftover potatoes and the whole pot of gravy with her to her room.\nEdgeworth:\n(That's quite an appetite for such a little girl...)February 8Heavenly HallGumshoe:\nWhoa! Not much of a view down here, huh? It's still better than the view from my apartment, though.Edgeworth:\nTsk! Someone's here! Hide yourself, Detective!???:\nOh! Why why why!? Why does this always happen!?Butz:\nWhenever I find a girl I like, they always run away! I even chased one of them to Japan... Next it's going to be prison, I guess. (Changed from [I even chased one of them to Tibet... Next it's going to be prison, I guess.] in the original release) ...I'll steal that detective's wallet. That'll get me locked up for sure. ...Nah. I can't do that to someone who looks like he's down on his luck.Gumshoe:\n...He's just talking to himself.Edgeworth:\nShh! Be quiet and listen!Butz:\nI knew it... I shouldn't have done that! I blew it again...Edgeworth:\n(\"Done that\"? What did he do, I wonder...)Gumshoe:\nHey! You! About what you just said... I got an objection!Butz:\nWh-Wh-Wh-What the...!? Ed-Edgey! You dirty rat!Edgeworth:\n*glare* (Gumshoe... You oaf...!)Gumshoe:\nI-I'm sorry, sir! Before I knew it, I was shouting out, \"Objection!\". And in a loud, commanding voice, too! I even pointed with my pointer finger!Edgeworth:\n...You've watched too many trials.Gumshoe:\nI'm sorry!Edgeworth:\nOK, Larry, the jig is up. What have you got to say for yourself?Butz:\nUngh...Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEagle River\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThis is the Eagle River, sir. It runs pretty fast, so it doesn't ice over, even in the winter.\nEdgeworth:\nIf it had iced over, Wright would have been in some serious trouble.\nGumshoe:\nYou're right about that! He would've landed on the ice, and slid downstream to who knows where.\nEdgeworth:\n(...Not exactly what I meant, but alright...)\n\n\n\n\nDusky Bridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt's a little far, but I have a pretty clear view of Dusky Bridge from here.\nButz:\nAhh. I still can't believe it! ...Really.\nEdgeworth:\n...? What is it, Larry?\nButz:\nHuh! Err, uhh, nothing. It's nothing!\nGumshoe:\nSounds pretty suspicious to me!\nEdgeworth:\n(Something about that statement smells... And you know what they say...)\n\n\n\n\nStairway\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThese go all the way to Dusky Bridge. It's a pretty long, but easy, walk.\nGumshoe:\nI fell down 4 times on my way down here, sir!\nButz:\nOh, sorry about that, Detective. I ate four bananas and tossed their peels on the stairs on my way down here...\nGumshoe:\n... What!? So that's what I was slipping on!\nButz:\nBe careful on the way back. Those deadly banana peels are still out there.\nGumshoe:\nHmm... That's a real important piece of information right there, Mr. Edgeworth!\n\n\n\n\nString of flags\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this festive-looking ornament?\nButz:\nIt reminds me of art class in grade school. We used to have a lot of fun decorating the classroom with origami. Remember?\nEdgeworth:\nW-Well, I...\nButz:\nOh, yeah... You were never any good at it.\nGumshoe:\nReally?\nButz:\nYeah, this guy was so bad, he couldn't even fold a dollar, let alone a crane. Everyone tried to comfort him, but he would just sit there sobbing.\nGumshoe:\nReally? I never would have expected that.\nEdgeworth:\nBe quiet already! I'll never forget the shame of that day! You want a crane! I can now make a perfect quarter-inch crane without a single flaw!\nButz:\n... You know, Edgey... Nothing for nothing, but a quarter-inch crane without a single flaw is not easy.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's quite a feat, Prosecutor Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\n(Grr... This is exactly why I hate childhood friends...)\n\n\n\n\nShack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThat's a horrible graffiti problem you've got there, pal.\nButz:\nYou don't know anything, Detective. This is art! It's an expression of my bittersweet love for Iris.\nEdgeworth:\nLarry. Do you know what the difference between graffiti and true art is?\nButz:\n... It's how the artist himself defines it, right?\nEdgeworth:\n... (I should've seen that one coming.)\nGumshoe:\nWell, if that's the case, then all of my lunchboxes are masterpieces too, pal!\n\n\n\n\nRoof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe straw roof is totally covered with freshly fallen powdery snow.\nGumshoe:\nWow, makes a nice image, doesn't it? I always did like the rustic look.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Heavenly Hall\"... I suppose it's an appropriate name in some sense.\nButz:\nYou got that right. Look at that bridge up there. This place has to be heaven, because that thing is hell.\nEdgeworth:\n... You would do well to remember, Larry... ...that this is a sacred place to some people.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeavenly Hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this little shack anyway?\nButz:\nWell, I just discovered it myself yesterday.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd why were you down here in the first place?\nButz:\nErr, come on... I'm an artist... I was looking for a good place to sketch. This is a great little place! It's err... artistic. It's quiet, it's cold, it's got no power, and it looks like it's about to collapse.\nGumshoe:\n...Sounds a lot like my apartment there, pal.\nEdgeworth:\n(One thing's for sure... No one is likely to show up and disturb you here...)\nButz:\nSo can I get you something to drink? Some hot water, maybe?\nGumshoe:\n...He's getting all buddy-buddy on us, sir.\n\n\n\n\nIris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\n...Listen to me, Edgey. You've gotta do this... You've gotta save Iris!\nEdgeworth:\nWhy are you so sure she's innocent? Because she's cute?\nButz:\nWatch your mouth! Anyway, I've made up my mind about it! I'm going to marry that girl!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nGumshoe:\nUmm... Mr. Edgeworth is pretending he didn't hear you, so I'm gonna ask for him. Have you already asked this girl to marry you?\nButz:\nNo, no. Not yet. But I can tell how she feels by the look in her eyes! She's got this \"I really want this man to carry me over the threshold\" look! I'm sure Nick would be surprised! He'd never imagine that I could marry such a beautiful girl like that!\nEdgeworth:\nSomething tells me he would be shocked, indeed.\nButz:\nThat's why I didn't want her to do anything dangerous. I mean, what am I gonna do if she gets hurt?\nGumshoe:\n... What is this guy trying to say? He lost me about a mile back...\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... If we really want to know the answer to that... (...we're going to have to drag him onto the witness stand.)\n\n\n\n\nThe night of the crime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nCome to think of it, you still haven't answered my question. Where were you and what were you doing last night?\nButz:\nAww, man... Don't you have anything else to talk about? With that kind of attitude, you'll never be a ladies' man like me...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nButz:\nO-OK, OK! Chill out with those scary eyes! I got it! If you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Something incredible\"?\n\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n\nButz:\n...Yeah, yeah. But let's not talk about that now. Let's talk about the good old days. What do you say? Come on, I'll pour you a nice cup of hot water.\nEdgeworth:\n(Why hasn't he realized... ...that I absolutely despise talking about the \"good old days\", especially with him?)\n\n\n\n\nThe night of the crime (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat exactly did you see last night?\nButz:\nWell... It's kinda hard to say...\n\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n\nButz:\nIt's one of those things... Ya know what I mean...? It's like... It's not so much \"what\" I saw, as it's the situation in general... You see what I'm getting at? Whew, that's a relief. Thanks, buddy. Ha ha ha ha ha.\nEdgeworth:\n(I have the strangest urge to smash this guy against those big, nasty locks...)\n\n\n\n\nThe night of the crime (after breaking Psyche-Locks)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo you were here in Heavenly Hall last night, were you not, Larry? And you saw the lightning hit Dusky Bridge, didn't you?\nButz:\nS-Sorry, Edgey...\nGumshoe:\nSorry doesn't cut it, you scumbag! Threatening a young lady like that...\nButz:\n*gulp*... ... Wait, hold up.\nGumshoe:\n...What now, pal?\nButz:\nWhat are you talking about!? What \"threatening\" stuff!?\nGumshoe:\nI'll tell you what! You tried to scare Iris by threatening to expose her secret, pal!\nButz:\nWhat do you mean threaten!? When did I threaten her!?\nGumshoe:\n\"...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed...\" That sure sounds like a threat to me, pal! Blackmail, in fact!\nButz:\nGimme a break! It's a love letter! Haven't you ever been in love!?\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What did you just say!?\nButz:\nMy love for her burns so hotly, it could melt all the snow on this mountain!\nEdgeworth:\nO-Oh? Then what is this secret you mention!?\nButz:\nCome on, Edgey... Don't you get it? I'm talking about the secret love between her and me! Obviously she wouldn't want old lady Bikini to know about it, right...? About our... hot and sour... bittersweet love affair!\nEdgeworth:\n... Alright, then why did you send a love letter in a business-like manila envelope!?\nButz:\nGive me a break! It's not my fault I didn't have any other envelopes! Yeesh!\nGumshoe:\nThen why were you so quick to apologize, pal!?\nButz:\nIt's cuz Edgey gave me that scary look of his!\nEdgeworth:\n... ...\nButz:\nWhat's wrong, Edgey? Why are you so quiet all of a sudden?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's it? THAT'S what all those huge locks were about? (Changed from [That's it? That's all [sic] those huge locks were about?] in the original release) I-I don't understand why you were so defensive...\nButz:\nWell, I dunno either... I guess the thing is... ...you shouldn't expect too much from a guy like me. ...Hey, come on. Don't let it get you down!\nGumshoe:\n... B-But Mr. Edgeworth! This guy is still hiding something! I know it!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nDon't forget what this guy said just a minute ago!\n\n\nButz:\nIf you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible.\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm... He's right!) Larry!\nButz:\nWh-What!? Y-You're looking at me like a hungry dog that just found a bone!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat was this \"something incredible\" you saw last night...? ...You're going to tell me, Larry!

You're really upset, aren't you, Edgey? OK, I'll talk!\nEdgeworth:\n...Huh? (That was a bit too easy...)\nButz:\nYeah, anyway! It was awesome! Never seen anything like it! At around 10 o'clock last night, it started thundering. I'd been sleeping... I'm not sure for how long. Suddenly... ZING! The world in front of me went white! Like I'd just been slapped in the face by my old girlfriend, Naomi!\nEdgeworth:\n...And then?\nButz:\nAnd then... It was on fire! The bridge was on fire!\nEdgeworth:\nDusky Bridge caught on fire!? Are you saying you saw it with your own eyes?\nButz:\nHey! Why are you giving me the evil eye!? I'm telling the truth!\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm... There are still three Psycholocks remaining... (Changed from [Hmm... There are still 3 Psycholocks remaining...] in the original release) That means he's still trying to hide something...) By the way, Larry... Where were you when you saw that happen?\nButz:\nWh-Wh-Wh-Where you say? Wh-Wh-What do you mean!?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean, \"What do I mean\"!? ...Just answer the question!\nButz:\nI-I was in my own room... by the Main Hall! Where else would I be!?\nEdgeworth:\nAs usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar. The problem, I suspect, lies there...\nButz:\nTh-Th-Th-Th-There?

Try drinking your hot water. If you don't drink it fast it's going to get cold.\nEdgeworth:\nOh, sorry... (It's cold alright... The water... And my evidence.)\nButz:\nWell? Have you calmed down yet?\nEdgeworth:\nUm, yes... I'm going to think it over again.\nButz:\nH-Hey, I'm telling you... there's nothing to think over! I was in my room doing \"she loves me, she loves me not\" with a bunch of flowers.\nLeads back to:\n\"As usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar.\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis is a map of the area. Take a look around the vicinity of Hazakura Temple.\nButz:\nWh-What am I looking for?\nEdgeworth:\nI think that should be fairly obvious. The Main Hall is surrounded by trees and it's impossible to see the bridge from here.\nButz:\nWhat...!? Why didn't you tell me that before!?\n\n1 LOCK BROKEN\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Well? How about it?\nButz:\nHow about what?\nEdgeworth:\nDo you feel like talking now?\nButz:\nAbout what?\nEdgeworth:\n... (It looks like it won't be that easy after all...) ...You leave me no choice. I'll have to move on to the next step. You weren't in your room at the temple. So then... Where were you?\nButz:\nY-Y-You don't know that I wasn't in my room!\nEdgeworth:\n(So where was Larry, and why was he there...? If I've read the situation up to this point correctly, the answer is fairly obvious.) ...Very well then. Let's test my theory.

Like \"How are you doing?\" or something.\nEdgeworth:\n...Larry. Look at the expression on my face. Do I look like I was just making small talk?\nButz:\nTo be honest? No... I guess not. Ha ha ha ha ha...\nEdgeworth:\n(It appears I didn't think it through carefully enough.)\nLeads back to:\n\"So where was Larry, and why was he there...?\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall!\nButz:\n...Wh-Why would I be hanging out in this old shack? It's freezing cold, there's no electricity, and it could fall apart at any minute...\nEdgeworth:\nLarry... How do you know that anyway? How do you know there's no electricity? After all, it's not that dark yet.\nButz:\nAh... Uh-oh!\nEdgeworth:\nIn other words, you have just provided evidence to prove my theory... My theory that you've at least once in your life visited Heavenly Hall after sunset!\n\n1 LOCK BROKEN\n\nButz:\nI have to admit I'm impressed, Edgey! You're in a totally different league from Nick.\nEdgeworth:\n...That's nice. Now tell me. What were you doing at this cold little shack last night?\nButz:\nThat's what you might call... A \"Fair de Core\".\nEdgeworth:\nI think you mean \"affaire de coeur\". Could it be you were... waiting for someone?\nButz:\nOoooh nooo! Y-You really are one scary guy, you know...\nEdgeworth:\nI believe that last night, you were waiting for this person to come meet you!\n\n\n\nPresent Iris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n \nEdgeworth:\n...Well, Larry!?

You should be ashamed of yourself!\nButz:\nOhhh... OHHHH!\nEdgeworth:\nFirst of all, what's this at the top of the letter? It says, \"Salutation here\"!\nButz:\nW-Well that's what it said in that book, \"Letter Writing for Dummies\"!\nEdgeworth:\nYou're not supposed to actually write that!

I'm just... hardly accustomed to that sort of thing.Edgeworth:\nWorry not... And in any case, whatever it was that he saw on the night of the incident... Mark my words, I will drag it out him!Iris:\nDoes that mean... Mr. Laurice is the witness today...?Edgeworth:\n...No. I believe that nun... will be the first to take the stand.Iris:\nSister Bikini...Edgeworth:\nShe claims to have seen the very instant in which you carried out the crime.Iris:\n...Edgeworth:\nI just want to ask you one last time. It really wasn't you who killed Ms. Elise Deauxnim, correct?Iris:\n... That is correct. It wasn't me.Edgeworth:\n...Very well, then.Iris:\nUm... Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\n...Yes?Iris:\nYou are a prosecutor... aren't you? Are you sure about this? If your true identity is revealed...Edgeworth:\nDon't worry. I've made the necessary arrangements. (Changed from [Don't worry. ...I've taken the necessary steps.] in the original release)Iris:\nI-I see... (Changed from [Y-You have...?] in the original release)Edgeworth:\n...Iris. It is a prosecutor's job to doubt people.Iris:\n...Edgeworth:\nBut right now... I am a defense attorney. A defense attorney's job is to believe in people, and to believe until the bitter end. That's what my friend told me once. (Changed from [That's what a friend of mine told me once.] in the original release)Iris:\nMr. Edgeworth...Edgeworth:\nI simply ask that you watch and decide for yourself... (Changed from [You may pass judgment on me from the defendant's chair. You are the one to decide...] in the original release) ...whether or not I am fit to do the task I have been entrusted. (Changed from [...whether or not I am able to do the task I have been entrusted.] in the original release)Iris:\n... ...Very well, sir. I leave my defense in your capable hands.February 9, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 7Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Sister Iris of Hazakura Temple.Edgeworth:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:\n...The defense does indeed appear to be ready... However, the same cannot be said for the prosecution in this case.Edgeworth:\n...Indeed.Judge:\nI'm not sure I like such blatant waste of this court's time. An empty prosecutor's chair can only mean... ...that the prosecutor has no confidence in their ability to prove their case. It would seem this case is already over before it had a chance to begin. I am ready to announce my verdict at this time. This court finds the defendant...???:???:\nThe prosecution... stands ready.Judge:\nA-And you are...?von Karma:\nFranziska von Karma... Prosecuting prodigy.Judge:\nV-Von Karma, you say...? Perchance, you wouldn't be of any relation to the legendary prosecutor Manfred von Karma?von Karma:\n... Legends are a thing of the past. I am a Von Karma. That is all. Upon a special request, I flew in today for the purposes of prosecuting this case.Judge:\nY-You did!? Then... you must be quite a big shot, eh! By the way, Mr. Edgeworth...Edgeworth:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nI'm almost certain that I've seen you somewhere before. Or am I just imagining things? You look very much like a prosecutor I met once...Edgeworth:\n...I believe you are imagining things, Your Honor.Judge:\nMs. von Karma? Do you have anything to say?von Karma:\n... There is no such weakling as this man among those of the Prosecutor's Office.Judge:\nThere... there isn't...? But I'm sure... once before, in this courtroom... Ack!von Karma:\n...I told you, there is no such weakling!Judge:\nWh-What is that!? A whip!? I'm not sure I care for such a thing in my courtroom! B-Bailiff! Remove that whip, at...Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\n...I have no objection to the whip.Judge:\nY-You don't...?Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution can wield a whip or drink seventeen cups of coffee... But there is still only one truth. That is what I stand here to prove today!von Karma:\nThis promises to be interesting... Miles Edgeworth. ...I had expected to face Phoenix Wright here today. But looking at you now... ...maybe this is what I have been waiting for all this time. Miles Edgeworth! I will not allow this chance to crush you slip through my fingers!Edgeworth:\n...I see you brought your flair for the histrionic.Judge:\nAllow me to add to the things I'm not sure about... People acting bizarrely in my court! Uwa-hah!von Karma:\n...The stage is set. Now continue with the proceedings, Your Honor.Judge:\nVery well. Ms. von Karma, please give an outline of this case. With as little whipping as possible!von Karma:\nThe murder victim is the famed picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Her body was found in the Hazakura Temple courtyard. She had been stabbed through the torso by a ceremonial sword from a golden statue.Judge:\nThe sword in this picture... is the weapon in question, correct...? ...Very well. The court accepts this photo of the crime scene.Crime Photo added to the Court Record.von Karma:\nThere is no mistake. This was the doing of Sister Iris. After all... there is a witness to her crime.Judge:\n...Very well. Please bring this witness to the stand!Edgeworth:\n(And so it begins... My first and my last trial... as a defense attorney!)von Karma:\n...Witness. State your name and occupation. Please.Judge:\nH-Hold on here! I'm not sure about being not sure if I care for this at all! Witness! Please stand up nice and straight!Edgeworth:\nIf I recall correctly... ...there are a few milk crates in the Defendant's Lobby for our back pain-plagued witness. (Changed from [...there are a few milk crates in the defendant's lobby for witnesses with bad backs.] in the original release)Judge:\nBailiff! Fetch a crate for this poor lady, please!von Karma:\n...Once again. Your name and occupation, please.Bikini:\nLittle old me? Well, I'm the head nun of Hazakura Temple on Eagle Mountain. My name is Bikini. You got it? Bikini. Nice to meet everyone.Judge:\n... But you don't appear to be wearing a bikini right now... Uwah!von Karma:\n...The courtroom is the garden of holy judgment. Those with lechery in their hearts should leave this sanctuary at once!Judge:\nY-You want me to leave!?Bikini:\nNo need to get your bikinis in a twist! Let me tell you, I'm a sight to behold in summer! Wha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha!Edgeworth:\nIn any case... Witness. I hear that you saw the crime take place on the night in question.Bikini:\nThat's right! I can still hardly believe it myself, to be honest. There's no way dear little Iris could do anything like that...Judge:\nLet us hear what you have to say then. First, tell us aboot your own movements that night, eh!Witness Testimony-- The Night of the Murder --Bikini:\nThat night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But...\nWell, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently.\nSo, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.\nThere's no bath at the Inner Temple, you see, and I needed a long, hot soak.\nIt was after I had finished, just as I was heading back... that's when I saw it!Judge:\nHmm... So it was simply coincidence that you found yourself returning to Hazakura Temple?Bikini:\n...Yes, you could say that. If my back hadn't been in so much pain, I would have stayed at the Inner Temple.Edgeworth:\n(That sounds like a pretty important statement she just made...)von Karma:\nThere is only one problem with this testimony that I can see... And you're not about to fall at the first hurdle, now are you, Miles Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth. ...Please begin your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- The Night of the Murder --Bikini:\nThat night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this Inner Temple...?\nBikini:\nWell, see, conversing with the spirits is what we train people to do, right?\nJudge:\nWe'll be the ones asking you the questions, madam.\nBikini:\n...In order to do that, a place strong in spiritual power is required. There's a small temple across Dusky Bridge, called the Inner Temple.  Acolytes must spend an entire night there to undergo intense training.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd how exactly do you help with this process...?\nBikini:\nIt is all quite exacting. It can't be performed without a nun supervising.\nvon Karma:\nLike a tutor, watching to make sure a spoiled child studies.\nEdgeworth:\n(A tutor with a whip, in your case.) If that is the case... ...then why did you return to Hazakura Temple, where the murder took place?Bikini:\nWell, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nViolently...?\nBikini:\nThat's right. It's no laughing matter, especially in winter! I can't hold anything heavier than a knife and fork during the cold months! Just being alive is like strict training! Wah ha ha! Wha ha! Wah ha ha!\nEdgeworth:\nOn the night of the murder, was this fabulous back of yours hurting again...?\nBikini:\nThat's right. Raging like a bull in a pigpen. I almost fainted once or twice! I just knew that unless I warmed it up, it was going to finally finish me off!Bikini:\nSo, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou \"left Iris to help\"... With what?\nBikini:\nWhat do you think? The acolyte's training, of course. It was just past 10 PM, so we were starting to enter into the training exercises proper.\nJudge:\nWasn't it your place to remain with the disciple?\nBikini:\nWell, the job is simply to watch over the acolyte so that they don't pass away.\nEdgeworth:\nJust to confirm this point again, that night... ...you met Iris in the Inner Temple, correct?\nBikini:\nYes, yes. She's a gentle, honest girl. She's never once failed to follow my directions.Present Iris's Testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Witnesses have to undergo their own trials, I'm afraid. The defendant's fate rests on their powers of observation and memory, after all.\nBikini:\nWell, well, well. Don't worry! I'm more than up to the task! I'm a woman of faith, after all. The head honcho of Hazakura Temple.\nEdgeworth:\nIn that case, Ms. Honcho... I'd like you to explain something for me. The discrepancy between your testimony and that of the defendant, Iris. She claims that after ringing the lights out bell, she went back and stayed in her room. ...Which means! She did not go to the Inner Temple at all!\nBikini:\nN... No...! She said that...?\nvon Karma:\n\nvon Karma:\nA defendant or a witness... Who is more likely to lie, do you suppose? The defendant is simply lying to cover her back!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nBut that is completely illogical. The murder was committed in the courtyard of Hazakura Temple. Claiming that she \"went to the Inner Temple\" would make for a much better alibi.\nvon Karma:\n...!\nBikini:\nBut that is odd... Whatever the reason... I can't believe that she would lie...!\nJudge:\nHmm... she does indeed have honest eyes! Uwaaaah!\nvon Karma:\n...All people lie. That is my belief.\nJudge:\nWhy am I the only one being whipped in here...!? Anyway! Neither the witness nor the defendant have any reason to lie! Which means... We must call your memory into question...\nBikini:\nDear, dear, dear. You're older than me and yet you want to play that game, do you?\nJudge:\nA-Ah, well, that isn't exactly what I...\nBikini:\nMy memory is perfect! Crystal clear! Especially in winter!\nJudge:\nThen... I suppose it's too early to end this cross-examination, eh. Mr. Edgeworth. If you are going to question the memory of this witness... ...you will need to show me a more decisive piece of evidence.\nEdgeworth:\n...Understood, Your Honor. (I was naïve to think that alone would do the trick.)\nJudge:\nThen please add your comments aboot Iris to the testimony... And let us return to the cross-examination.\nChanges statement from \"So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.\" to \"Iris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner.\"Bikini:\nIris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nAre you sure that you're not making a mistake...?\nBikini:\n...You, young man, need to get your estimation of me up from the floor!\nEdgeworth:\nNngh...!\nBikini:\nIris always wears the same clothes. The smallest thing out of place would have stood out like a sore thumb to me! You're making a mistake, thinking I made a mistake!\nJudge:\n...An excellent finish there, witness.\nEdgeworth:\n(Still, I have to wonder...)Present Iris's Hood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...Witness. Let's get one thing straight.\"Bikini:\nThere's no bath at the Inner Temple, you see, and I needed a long, hot soak.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...So you returned to the Hazakura Temple in order to take a bath?\nBikini:\nMy back is to blame for everything. It's a \"do or be done in\" kind of world, after all.\nEdgeworth:\nHow long were you in the bath for, if you don't mind me asking?\nBikini:\n... My my my, what a filthy little rogue you are! I know what's on your mind!\nEdgeworth:\n...?\nBikini:\nI bet your next question is going to be, \"Where exactly did you wash?\" Ah, THIS is why you have to watch the young ones...\nEdgeworth:\nW-What are you going on about!? I was... Gwah!\nvon Karma:\n...Pathetic, Miles Edgeworth.\nJudge:\nThe lowest of the low.\nEdgeworth:\n(Is there some sort of \"Kick Me\" sign stuck to the defense's bench!?)\nBikini:\nAnyway, I couldn't afford to be away from my post for too long, you understand, so...Bikini:\nIt was after I had finished, just as I was heading back... that's when I saw it!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe crime took place in the courtyard, correct...?\nBikini:\nWhen you go from my room to the Main Hall... ...you have to take a winding hallway from which you can see the courtyard.\nvon Karma:\nThat's right. In other words... ...it was pure coincidence that the witness saw the crime taking place before her eyes. There was no complicated set-up in this case!\nJudge:\nHmm... That certainly seems to be true.Edgeworth:\n(There is indeed only one problem with this testimony. If I can clearly point out what it is, then I can begin to quantify... ...just how good this witness's memory and observation skills are.)Edgeworth:\n...Witness. Let's get one thing straight. The defendant whom you claim to have met... ...she was wearing this \"Demon-Warding Hood\", correct?Bikini:\nOf course! That is a very important piece of clothing, I'll have you know! Wha ha ha! Wha ha ha! Ha ha... Wait a minute...von Karma:von Karma:\nH-Hold it right there! Why do you have that...!?Edgeworth:\nThat's the question of the day, now isn't it... Ms. von Karma? I'll have you know that this hood was given to someone as a gift that night. Before the lights out bell was rung.von Karma:\nW... What!?Edgeworth:\n...You know where I'm going with this, don't you? If the witness had seen the defendant as she claims... ...then the Iris she saw should have been missing this very hood! (Changed from [...the defendant couldn't have been wearing this very hood!] in the original release)Bikini:\nWell well well!Edgeworth:\n(It's not a bad feeling at all, exposing contradictions like this... Now I understand that happy look on Wright's face every time he does it...)Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Witness, your response... Wuahaaa!von Karma:\n...Sister. This hood... You have spare ones around the temple, don't you?Bikini:\nSpares... Well... I do tend to make too many of them.Judge:\nI see... A stockpile. A surplus of hoods, eh?Bikini:\nEach nun is only given one hood. This should be the only hood that Iris owned...Judge:\nHmm... Then this is quite strange! Waaaah!von Karma:\nIf there was a surplus of hoods, then she could have worn one of those! ...There is no contradiction here!Judge:\nHmm...Edgeworth:\n(I'm sorry to break this to you, Ms. von Karma... but you won't get away that easily. Discrepancies such as this will sow seeds in any human heart. The seeds of doubt.)Judge:\n...Witness. While I don't wish to call your testimony into doubt... ...you must give every detail with precision.Bikini:\nI-I'm not sure I'm comfortable going along with this...von Karma:\nSister. You shall continue with your testimony. Tell us what you saw after finishing your bath, on your way back to the Inner Temple!Edgeworth:\n(Those seeds of doubt are sprouting in the judge's heart. They just need a little more stimulation to bear fruit... Contradictory stimulation.)Witness Testimony-- After My Bath --Bikini:\nI finished my bath around 11, and I thought I should return to the Inner Temple.\nAnd as I was walking back... I heard a noise from the courtyard. I took a look and...\nIris was...! Oh, Mystic Elise! And with that sword, of all things!\nMystic Elise was staying in the corner room, which faces out onto the courtyard.\nThe stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window.Judge:\nYou saw a truly terrible sight, didn't you...? If I was in your place... ...then it would be much like Ms. von Karma whipping Mr. Edgeworth in two in court! And me, seeing it all from this very chair! ...Er, well, something like that.Edgeworth:\n(This judge... His imagination is about as vivid and creative as Detective Gumshoe...)von Karma:\nI would look the fool if I commented on such foolishness. Anyway, this case is mine... Miles Edgeworth!Edgeworth:\nCalling everyone by their full name... Can't you do something about that habit of yours?Cross Examination-- After My Bath --Bikini:\nI finished my bath around 11, and I thought I should return to the Inner Temple.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...How far is it from your room to the Inner Temple?\nBikini:\nLet me think a moment... About twenty minutes, on these stumps of mine. It's about 15 minutes to Dusky Bridge from Hazakura Temple. The Inner Temple is just beyond the bridge.\nvon Karma:\nStill, you never made it back there that night, did you?\nBikini:\nT-That's right... I was heading along the walkway toward the Main Hall...Bikini:\nAnd as I was walking back... I heard a noise from the courtyard. I took a look and...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou say you heard a noise...?\nBikini:\n\"Thump\"... Just like that.\nvon Karma:\n...That could only be the sound of the victim falling.\nBikini:\nIt's very quiet in the temple, you know. You can even hear the snow falling from the branches. \"Thump\"... Just like that.\nJudge:\nBut then, couldn't this noise you heard have been snow falling to the ground?\nBikini:\n... I never thought of that. Wah ha ha. Wha ha ha. Ha ha...\nJudge:\nHoh hoh. Hoh hoh. Hoh hoh... Uaaaaaah!\nvon Karma:\nThe next one to laugh gets a whipping!\nBikini:\nWell. Whatever the source of the sound, I looked over at the courtyard and...Bikini:\nIris was...! Oh, Mystic Elise! And with that sword, of all things!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...This is the second time that the witness has testified to seeing the defendant. But... some doubt remains in these claims.\nBikini:\nHey, just what does that mean!? Just because you're a good-looking young man doesn't give you the right to...\nEdgeworth:\nThe murderer who stabbed the victim with the sword... Sister Bikini, try to recall exactly who it was you saw! As clearly as you can!\nBikini:\nHmm... Well. You're a handsome young man, so I'll forgive you. ... Oh! Now that you mention it... There was something awfully strange about her... Something that has been bugging me all this time!\nEdgeworth:\n...Please, don't keep us in suspense.\nBikini:\nHer hood!\nvon Karma:\nHer hood...?\nBikini:\nThat's right! ...It's coming back to me... Iris... She wasn't wearing her hood! I thought something was out of place, but... It all makes sense now, doesn't it? After all, she'd given that hood away to someone, right?\nEdgeworth:\n...Urk!\nvon Karma:\nHah... You've dug your own grave, Miles Edgeworth!\nJudge:\nWhat do you say, Mr. Edgeworth? Is this testimony important?\n\n\n\nIt's not important\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(...This line of questioning is only going to tear the  wound open further.) These statements are as useless as the investigations of a certain detective. ...There is no need to record them.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nJudge:\nVery well. ...Please, continue with your testimony.\nvon Karma:\nHmph...\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nIt's important\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(This may initially appear to put me at a disadvantage... But, I can't see any other leads at the moment...) ...Your Honor. I would like these new statements to be added to the testimony.\nvon Karma:\nHeh... Miles Edgeworth.\nvon Karma:\nIf you want to hang yourself, you need only to ask. I'll gladly lend you my whip!\nJudge:\nWitness. Add that statement to your testimony.\nBikini:\n...No problem.\nAdds statement \"Now that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on.\"Bikini:\nNow that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou are sure about that...?\nBikini:\nYes. After all, we always wear the same clothes. Ah! I don't mean because we're poor, you understand? It's our style. Yes, that's it!\nEdgeworth:\n...There's absolutely no need to explain yourself.\nBikini:\nAnyway! She looked different from normal, so that really stuck out.\nvon Karma:\nLike me holding a whippet puppy instead of my whip.\nEdgeworth:\n(At least then it might bite you and not someone else...)\nBikini:\nIris didn't have her hood on. I'm sure of it!\nJudge:\n...Very well. Now, please tell us aboot the victim, eh.Bikini:\nMystic Elise was staying in the corner room, which faces out onto the courtyard.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe room the victim was staying in overlooked the courtyard, correct?\nJudge:\nWhich means... the victim's room was on the second floor?\nBikini:\nNo, no. Hazakura Temple is a single story building. But the mountain itself slopes downward... ...which elevates the Main Gate side of the temple and the guest rooms in the back... ...to about the height of a two story building.\nJudge:\nI see... And the victim was staying in one of these elevated rooms, correct?\nBikini:\nYes... I should know. I'm the one who carried her things to her room, after all...Bikini:\nThe stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat makes you so sure of all this...?\nBikini:\nIt's just like I told you earlier... \"I heard a noise from the courtyard.\" OK? \"Thump\"... Just like that.\nvon Karma:\nYou're one smart sister, I'll give you that. The autopsy report states that... ...the victim's body was covered in bruises... ...indicating a fall from around 10 feet in height.\nJudge:\nHmm... It appears that the witness was not mistaken then.\nBikini:\nYep. Yep. I'm more than just a pretty face. Especially in winter! I'm a woman of faith, after all. The head honcho of Hazakura Temple.\nEdgeworth:\n(There's only two of them working there...!)\nvon Karma:\nWhat's wrong, Miles Edgeworth? No snappy comeback remark?\nEdgeworth:\n...Present Elise's Autopsy Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...Impressive logic. That's what I'd like to say, anyway.\"Edgeworth:\n(...It doesn't feel like she is lying. This is very powerful testimony, too. She claims to have seen the instant in which the defendant stabbed the victim... There are only two things I can believe in right now... My client, Iris, and my own abilities as a defense attorney.)Edgeworth:\n...Impressive logic. That's what I'd like to say, anyway.Bikini:\nOh please, do! My brain is something else... especially in winter!Edgeworth:\nHowever... I think you are overlooking one thing. ...Ms. von Karma. Would you be so kind as to take another look at the autopsy report?von Karma:\nT-The autopsy report...?Edgeworth:\nThe victim did fall from a height of 10 feet. ...However. This fall... was after she was killed.von Karma:\nAh...!Judge:\nT-That's right! It says \"after death\" right here!Edgeworth:\nThe scene the witness claims to have seen is contradictory! If the defendant stabbed and killed the victim there in the courtyard... ...how did the victim then go on to take a ten foot fall!?von Karma:\nAaah!Judge:\nO-Order! Order! The victim was killed and then fell! If that is the case... ...then the victim must have been killed in her room... Don't you agree?von Karma:\nTh-That is the logical conclusion... Yes, that's right! The victim must have been stabbed by the defendant in her own room! And she was then thrown out of her window down into the courtyard below!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nWere there any signs of a struggle in Ms. Deauxnim's room...?von Karma:\n...!Edgeworth:\nShe was stabbed with a sword! That would leave a blood stain, wouldn't you agree?Judge:\nW-Well, Ms. von Karma? Was there any blood...? Waaaaaah!von Karma:\n...No traces of blood were found in the victim's room.Judge:\n...Your whip has just caused traces of blood to be found on my glorious playoff beard. However! If there was no blood in the room, then your claim that... Waaaaah!von Karma:\nI'm sure there's no need for me to go over this... ...as I'm sure Your Honor is well aware... ...of when a stab wound produces the most blood.Judge:\nWhen it produces the most blood...?von Karma:\nVery little blood is actually lost at the moment of a blade's insertion. If you want to talk about when the most blood would be lost from a body... ...that would be when the blade is removed.Edgeworth:\nIndeed. With the weapon still in place... ...it acts like a lid on the wound.Judge:\nThat's true... With the weapon still in the body, there wouldn't be much bleeding... A perfectly reasonable line of thinking!von Karma:\nWe have come to a conclusion then! The victim was thrown out of the window with the sword still in place... This removes all of the contradictions!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! I must admit that this is a probable version of events!Edgeworth:\n(I'd expect no less from Franziska von Karma... She locates and takes control of every vital point!)von Karma:\n...Hmph...Judge:\nIt seems... ...that we need a clearer testimony from the witness. Remove all supposition on your part and tell us only the truth, please! Witness! Please! Remain standing on the crate!Bikini:\nDon't go selling me short now! The weight of winter snow has bent me out of shape! ...Especially my back and my mood!von Karma:\nSister. Please, give us your testimony. I will give you a vigorous massage once we are finished here.Edgeworth:\n(...With the whip?)Bikini:\n...Oh, boy. Alright, alright...Witness Testimony-- Further Details --Bikini:\nWhen I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place.\nThinking about it now, I didn't actually see her stab Mystic Elise.\nI've never seen so much blood before...\nThat's when I fainted. You can't blame me, can you?\nAnd when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back!Judge:\nHmm... This all confirms Ms. von Karma's theory...von Karma:\nVon Karmas strive for nothing but perfection. Putting together such facts is nothing for me! You should know that, Miles Edgeworth!Edgeworth:\n(\"Perfection\" is an impossibility, Franziska von Karma... And I'm here to teach you just that...)Cross Examination-- Further Details --Bikini:\nWhen I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nAt that time... was the victim bleeding?\nBikini:\nWell... I was very shocked to be seeing all this, of course... So I'm not entirely sure... But I don't think I saw any blood. Not then.\nvon Karma:\n...I'm sure that you didn't. The weapon was acting as a plug in the wound.\nEdgeworth:\nIn any case... Let's be clear on one very important point. Did you actually see the instant in which the victim was stabbed!?Bikini:\nThinking about it now, I didn't actually see her stab Mystic Elise.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Think carefully. This is very important.\nBikini:\nIt's Iris we are talking about here! I'm thinking for all I'm worth! ... No, when I looked over, the sword was already in Mystic Elise's body.\nJudge:\nHmmmmmm...\nEdgeworth:\n(It might not be  conclusive, but... ...this testimony supports her theory.)\nvon Karma:\nThe victim was stabbed in her room and then dropped into the courtyard... ...I think this proves it rather well, Miles Edgeworth.Bikini:\nI saw the instant in which the blade, plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n\"Smoothly\", you say... You're saying you saw the sword smoothly slide out?\nBikini:\nThat's right...\nBikini:\nThe whole thing happened right next to the gold statue of Mystic Ami. Mystic Elise was on the ground, and Iris was stooped over her. The sword was buried up to the hilt. When Iris stood up, the sword in her hand just slid out of Mystic Elise's body. It slid out from that gaping wound...! Aaaah...\nJudge:\nIt goes without saying... that if the sword was removed there would be bleeding.\nvon Karma:\n...Nothing out of place here.\nEdgeworth:\n(Is that really the case...? I can't help but feel that something about this testimony is very out of place... That something which couldn't possibly have happened... appears to have happened.)Present Shichishito\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Sister Bikini. You are a reliable witness...\"Bikini:\nI've never seen so much blood before...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...So you're saying that you saw the victim's blood?\nBikini:\nT-That's right! Some of it had splattered onto Iris, too...\nvon Karma:\nWhen the defendant was arrested, she was meditating in her room. And her blood-flecked clothing was neatly folded in the corner.\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What!? (Her clothes were blood-flecked as well...?)\nJudge:\nHmmm... That seems quite conclusive to me...\nEdgeworth:\n(What should I do...? Press this point further?)\n\n\n\nStop here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I can't afford to make things look any worse for the defendant. I'll bide my time for now.)\nJudge:\n...Witness. Please continue your testimony. From after you witnessed the victim bleeding!\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nGoing back to your previous statement... ...you said that you saw little bleeding when the victim was stabbed. But now... you say you saw the victim bleeding...?\nBikini:\nWell, well. I say that what I saw is what I saw.\nJudge:\nW-What did you see?\nBikini:\nMaybe I didn't see the poor woman get stabbed... But I saw the girl pull the sword out of her, plain as day.\nEdgeworth:\nPulling the sword out...?\nBikini:\nWell, it wasn't exactly pulling... It was more like it \"came out\".\nJudge:\nWitness! You will add this statement to your testimony!\nBikini:\nOh... Was that important...!?\nEdgeworth:\n(More important than you can imagine...)\nAdds statement \"I saw the instant in which the blade, plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out.\"Press (after adding statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWas the bleeding caused by the killer removing the sword...?\nBikini:\nNo mistaking it! I remember it all, clear as day!\nEdgeworth:\n...Don't you think that's a bit odd?\nvon Karma:\nWhat do you mean, Miles Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nWhy would the killer pull out the sword?\nvon Karma:\nWhat...?\nEdgeworth:\nIf all she wanted to do was place the weapon in the hand of the gold statue... ...then there was no reason to remove it from the body. All that would've accomplished is causing the victim to bleed unnecessarily. ...Your thoughts, Ms. von Karma?\nvon Karma:\nT-That's...\nJudge:\nIndeed... It is strange, now that you mention it.\nEdgeworth:\n(I'm going to need to find an answer to this mystery, too...)\nvon Karma:\nA-Anyway! The witness saw something terrible! ...So what did you do after that, witness?Bikini:\nThat's when I fainted. You can't blame me, can you?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nNow, on to what the killer did next... You saw none of it? Correct?\nBikini:\nWell... I was unconscious...\nvon Karma:\nHow long were you out for?\nBikini:\nI don't know... 10, maybe 20 minutes...? A young man with a very prickly looking head woke me up. ...By stepping on me, actually.\nJudge:\nHmm... I'm not sure I like that method of resuscitation!\nBikini:\nWell, I wasn't asking for mouth-to-mouth, or anything of the sort... ...but I would've welcomed a more gentle awakening right about then, let me tell you.\nEdgeworth:\n...I shall have words with the offender personally. What did you see upon awakening...?Bikini:\nAnd when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nBy \"Mystic Ami\", you are referring to the golden statue, correct?\nBikini:\nJust stabbing someone with the Shichishito, a sacred treasure, is terrible enough.\nBikini:\nBut to then make Mystic Ami hold the blade...!\nvon Karma:\nTruly, a heinous, despicable crime.\nEdgeworth:\nIt is easy to despise something. Anyone can do it. However, there is something that cannot be done so easily...\nvon Karma:\nWhatever it is, I'm sure it's doubly hard for you. Anyway, what is the problem?\nEdgeworth:\nExactly why would the killer set up this gruesome scene? Can anyone explain the reasoning behind that?\nvon Karma:\n...!\nJudge:\nHmmmmm... No, I don't think I can.\nvon Karma:\n... There isn't always a logical reason behind why someone acts!\nBikini:\nThat's true, so true. In early spring, for example, I often find myself...\nEdgeworth:\n(\"There isn't always\"... That phrase might come in handy someday.)Edgeworth:\n(There are too many unnatural elements in this case... Why was it necessary to use the Shichishito from the Ami statue as a weapon? Why was the weapon finally placed back in the hand of the statue? If I can expose the flaws in this testimony, perhaps then I will begin to find the truth.)Edgeworth:\nSister Bikini. You are a reliable witness... At least, I'd like to think so. But there are too many contradictions here.Bikini:\nW-What do you mean? You make it sound as though I'm a liar! But... You're a handsome young man, so I'll forgive you.von Karma:\nWhat contradictions are you talking about?Edgeworth:\nIn the scene that the witness claims to have seen... ...the weapon was thrust up to its hilt into the victim. Furthermore... the killer withdrew the weapon smoothly from the body. ...However! Both of these are complete impossibilities!Judge:\nWhat do you mean...? Please, explain you... Uwaaaaah!von Karma:\nExplain yourself!Edgeworth:\nTo start with... Do you think it would be possible to stab someone to the hilt with this? No matter how I look at the defendant, she doesn't appear strong enough for that.von Karma:von Karma:\n\"Doesn't appear\"...? What meaningless dribble! I, too, may appear to be weak and frail... But I can crush men under my heel and make them weep, should I so choose!Judge:\nThe objection stands! I wept a little back there, I must admit.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\n...That isn't the only issue here. If this sword was truly stabbed into the body up to the hilt... Well, just look at all the branches on it. It certainly wouldn't come out smoothly.von Karma:\nT-That's...Edgeworth:\nWe also have the problem of the amount of bleeding. It's true that when a blade is left in a body, it acts as a \"plug\" of sorts. However! When the weapon is shaped like this, it's an entirely different story. The wound would be too large for the blade to completely stop from bleeding!von Karma:von Karma:\nT-That's nothing more than conjecture! In reality, the victim was stabbed with the Shichishito. Even a weapon of this nature... ...may still sometimes slide out smoothly, and may still sometimes stop the blood loss!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nI'm not finished. There is still one more... conclusive contradiction.Judge:\nY-You've still got more!?Edgeworth:\n...This one is simple. If this sword really was thrust in all the way to the hilt... ...why is there only blood on the tip of it?von Karma:\nAh...!Edgeworth:\nIf this witness is telling the truth... Then there should be blood along the entire length of the sword!von Karma:\nNoooooo!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Ord-- Whaaaaaaaa!von Karma:\nBravo... Miles Edgeworth. Raising this many contradictions from a single piece of evidence! All the other attorneys I know could maybe manage one, if that!Judge:\nBut what does this all mean!? You have proven contradictions regarding the murder weapon, but...Edgeworth:\n...Having come this far, there can only be one answer.von Karma:\nAnd that is...?Edgeworth:\nThe weapon used to kill the victim... ...was not the Shichishito!Judge:\nW-Whaaaaaaaaat!?von Karma:\nA foolishly foolish idea born from the foolish mind of a foolhardy foolish fool.Edgeworth:\nLet's examine this again. What was it that made us think this sword was the murder weapon?Bikini:\nW-Well... It's because Mystic Ami was holding it...Edgeworth:\n...Exactly. However! If you reflect on this, that is the only basis we have to assume such a thing. The impression left by the scene was just too strong. That is what influenced us. It influenced us to believe that the Shichishito was the murder weapon!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! Waaaaaaaaah!von Karma:\nSo maybe the Shichishito was not the murder weapon. Even if that is the case... it changes nothing, Miles Edgeworth! The Sister here saw everything! She saw the defendant stab the victim with a sword-like object.Judge:\nHmmmmmm... That's true! Your response, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\n... If that is so... I would like the prosecution to answer the obvious question it raises.Judge:\nThe obvious... question?Edgeworth:\n...Yes. Namely... Where did the real murder weapon disappear to?von Karma:\n...!Edgeworth:\nIt goes without saying that the police searched the Main Hall and the surrounding area. ...Perhaps the prosecution can enlighten us as to if a \"sword-like object\" was found.von Karma:\nT-That's...Judge:\nAnswer the question, Ms. von Karma!von Karma:\n... No evidence of that kind was found.Judge:\nHmmmmm... Another mystery to throw onto the pile! A trial without a murder weapon is a tricky beast!Bikini:\nExcuse me... Could I say something...? I just remembered something, actually...von Karma:\n...What is it, Sister?Bikini:\nI was just thinking... It's possible... ...that just maybe... what actually happened was... it was just over there...Judge:\n... What exactly are you going on aboot here?Bikini:\nThe murder weapon, I mean! Maybe... I think I might know where the sword was disposed of!Edgeworth:\nYou what!?von Karma:\nWell then... I think we need to hear testimony from you one more time, Sister.Edgeworth:\n(Impossible...! What else... What else could this old woman have seen!?)Witness Testimony-- Location of the Weapon --Bikini:\nI saw the murder at around 11 PM...\nAnd after asking that it be reported, I went out to the Main Gate.\nAnd there... I saw tracks! Tracks that indicated the snowmobile had been used!\nIt takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, but less than 5 using one of those!\nMaybe they threw the weapon into Eagle River and came back while I was knocked out?\n...Iris could have done that. She can drive a snowmobile after all...Judge:\nHmmmmmm... Witness. Please, tell us everything you know right away next time.Bikini:\nWell. I'm not in the best of shape. What with my back and my age, you know.von Karma:\nQuite... There were indeed snowmobile tracks in front of the Main Gate. Here is a photograph.Judge:\nA snowmobile, eh... I see. Well, it certainly is an interesting theory...von Karma:\nThe tracks begin in front of Hazakura Temple... ...and run all the way to Dusky Bridge!Tracks Photo added to the Court Record.von Karma:\n...That solves your pesky little problem, yes? The Eagle River's current is quite swift, meaning that it doesn't freeze over in winter. Making it the perfect place to dispose of the murder weapon!Edgeworth:\n(Did she really go to the river to dispose of the murder weapon...?)Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth! ...Your cross-examination, please.Cross Examination-- Location of the Weapon --Bikini:\nI saw the murder at around 11 PM...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...You are sure about the time?\nBikini:\nYes... I was worried about it, after all.\nJudge:\nWhy was that?\nBikini:\nBecause I have a strong sense of responsibility. Especially at this time of year. The acolyte was being doused in freezing water at the time... I couldn't very well take it easy in the bath all night now, could I? So at 11, I decided to leave Hazakura Temple.\nEdgeworth:\n(Her estimation of the time seems reliable, at least.)\nvon Karma:\nPlease continue, Sister.Bikini:\nAnd after asking that it be reported, I went out to the Main Gate.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou asked Phoenix Wright to report the crime, correct?\nBikini:\nRight, right, the one who trampled me.\nEdgeworth:\n(It seems she is the type to hold a grudge...)\nBikini:\nThere isn't a phone in the Main Hall, so I sent him to the bridge.\nvon Karma:\nPhoenix Wright... He didn't even have his cell phone on him?\nEdgeworth:\nHe had forgotten it at home, apparently.\nvon Karma:\nWhat a naïve boy, as always! Not only do I always carry my phone, but I always have my whip in hand, too!\nBikini:\nAnyway, I was really scared... And it was taking him a while to get back... So I thought I'd go out by the Main Gate for a spell.Bikini:\nAnd there... I saw tracks! Tracks that indicated the snowmobile had been used!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nAs I recall, there was a snowmobile outside the Main Gate when I visited.\nBikini:\nThat's it. That's the only one we have. It'll run no matter how much snow falls!\nEdgeworth:\nNow, you're certain the snowmobile was there at the Main Gate when you arrived?\nBikini:\nYes, of course. It was parked in front of the gate.\nvon Karma:\nSo... she had already gone, discarded the murder weapon, and returned by that time.\nEdgeworth:\n(...I'm not sure if this is really relevant... What should I do...?)\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(...I need answers to every possible doubt.) The snowmobile in question... Was it still warm at that time?\nBikini:\nHuh? Huh? Huh? Huh? What do you mean? What do you mean?\nJudge:\nWhat do you mean, eh?\nvon Karma:\nWhat do you mean, Miles Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\n(...I'm playing to a slow crowd here.) It goes without saying that using a snowmobile will heat its engine. If it was still warm, then it means it was recently used.\nBikini:\nAh! I see! I never thought of that!\nJudge:\nHmmm, that's right! I overlooked that, too!\nvon Karma:\n...Of course you did.\nEdgeworth:\nThen answer the question please, witness.\nBikini:\n... I don't often go around touching hot engines...\nEdgeworth:\n...Hmm.\nBikini:\nHowever... Now that you mention it... There wasn't any snow on it.\nJudge:\nSnow...?\nBikini:\nYes. For some reason, only the snowmobile wasn't covered in snow...\nEdgeworth:\n(There wasn't any snow on it!? Curses!)\nJudge:\nIt seems highly likely that the killer did use the snowmobile then, eh!\nvon Karma:\nHow long does it take to get to Dusky Bridge by snowmobile?\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nStop here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(It looks very likely that the snowmobile is related to this case. I can't help but think that Iris used it... But for what...? I'd better hold off on this... for now.)\nJudge:\n...Well then, witness.\nJudge:\nHow long does it take to reach the bridge by snowmobile?\nLeads back to cross-examinationBikini:\nIt takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, but less than 5 using one of those!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nIn that case... why didn't you use it yourself? You could've spared yourself some walking.\nBikini:\nAh! There's a reason for that! Have we got a moment for me to explain?\nJudge:\nI think that's why the question was asked in the first place...\nBikini:\n...It was about a month ago. I was driving my beloved little snowmobile, happy as can be. I'd fetched some water and was heading back when I went and crashed into a tree! The tree and my back both went crunch. Just like that. Crunch.\nJudge:\nHmm... Crunch.\nBikini:\n...I haven't been able to find the courage to ride anything since then...\nBikini:\nAnyway, the killer must have used it!Bikini:\nMaybe they threw the weapon into Eagle River and came back while I was knocked out?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nRefresh our memory. How long were you knocked out for...?\nBikini:\nLike I said, somewhere between 10 to 20 minutes.\nvon Karma:\nIt's possible to get to the bridge and back in 10 minutes using the snowmobile...\nEdgeworth:\n...I have to concede that is more than enough time.\nvon Karma:\nIs that all you wish to concede, Miles Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n...Present Tracks Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I admit this photograph proves something.\"Bikini:\n...Iris could have done that. She can drive a snowmobile after all...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhile it would have been possible, time-wise... ...one element remains out of place here.\nJudge:\nOh? And what would this mystery element be?\nEdgeworth:\nThe killer's reasoning, Your Honor. \"Why did the killer do all of this?\" Why go to the Eagle River to dispose of the murder weapon when there are other methods?\nJudge:\nHmm... Too many unanswered questions! Your response, Ms. von Karma? Waaaaaaaah!\nvon Karma:\nTurning to me for help over the slightest thing! Why don't you think for yourself once in a while? ...Your Honor.\nJudge:\nWhaaaaat!?\nEdgeworth:\n(She's as over the top as always...)\nvon Karma:\nA-Anyway... Whatever the reason, the fact remains that the defendant could have done this! The murder weapon was disposed of in the river! Another point to me, Miles Edgeworth!Present Tracks Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I admit this photograph proves something.\"Edgeworth:\n(Another mystery to feed the fire... \"Was there any reason to go and throw away the murder weapon\"...? Luckily, there is surely a problem with this testimony. Now all I have to do is start poking holes in this flawed account...)Edgeworth:\nI admit this photograph proves something. It proves that the snowmobile was used on the night of the murder.von Karma:\nYou've finally accepted the inevitable, it seems... Miles Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\nHowever... If what the witness says is true, why is there only one set of tracks?von Karma:\nWhat do you mean...?Edgeworth:\nIris left Hazakura Temple, threw the weapon into the river, and then returned. If this was the case, then naturally there should be two sets of tracks in the snow! Those from heading out to the bridge, and those from coming back.Bikini:\n... Ah...! You're right!von Karma:\nHmph... You are forgetting one thing, Miles Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\n...?von Karma:\nOn the night of the murder, it was snowing. The tracks leading to the bridge were erased by the snowfall. This removes your precious contradiction, now doesn't it!Judge:\nI see! While she was at the river, the snow stopped... ...leaving just the return tracks in the snow.von Karma:\nWhat do you have to say now, Miles Edgeworth!Edgeworth:\n(Is there a flaw in her theory...? This idea that the snowfall covered one set of tracks...?)It's flawless.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...The tracks leading to the bridge were covered by the snow.\nEdgeworth:\nI do not have any evidence that can dispute this claim.\nvon Karma:\n...In which case, the rest is simple. Sister. Who was the only person who could have driven the snowmobile that night?\nBikini:\nWell... that would be...!\nvon Karma:\n...You can't hide it. I already know the answer.\nBikini:\n......... It could only be Iris.\nJudge:\nA-And the reason being...!?\nBikini:\nThere is only one key for the snowmobile.\nvon Karma:\nA key... that the defendant is responsible for!\nEdgeworth:\nWhaaaaat!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Now I don't feel like a clueless Puck Bunny! I understand everything! If the defendant did indeed use the snowmobile... ...which means that Iris is most definitely the murder--\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Your Honor! Please, wait a moment.\nJudge:\nWhat is it, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nThere is one gaping hole in Ms. von Karma's claim!\nJudge:\n... I'm not sure if I care for your response, Mr. Edgeworth. Next time, bring up whatever issues you have earlier. Do you understand!?\nEdgeworth:\nNngh... (I should have noticed it sooner...!)\nLeads to:\n\"The tracks to the river were covered by snow... What a nice theory.\"There is a contradiction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The tracks to the river were covered by snow... What a nice theory.\"Edgeworth:\nThe tracks to the river were covered by snow... What a nice theory. However, Ms. von Karma... That is impossible.von Karma:\n... Would you care to explain... ...why there is a rude index finger currently pointed in my general direction?Edgeworth:\n...No need. The evidence will do all of the talking for me.Judge:\nOn the night of the murder the killer went to, and returned from, Dusky Bridge... ...in order to dispose of the murder weapon. The outgoing tracks were erased by snow. ...Or so claims Ms. von Karma. Mr. Edgeworth! Present your evidence to the contrary, eh! Evidence that the outgoing tracks were not covered by snow!Present Weather Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWitness! Please tell us again what time it was when you witnessed the crime.\nBikini:\nLike I said! It was around 11.\nEdgeworth:\n...Of course, this means that the weapon was thrown away after that time, correct? On that note... Please take a look at this data. It is the weather report for Eagle Mountain on the night of the murder.\nJudge:\nThe... weather report...?\nEdgeworth:\nSnow started to fall at 7 PM... But it stopped at around 10:50.\nvon Karma:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nTherefore! When the Sister witnessed the crime at 11 PM... ...the snow had already stopped falling! It is impossible for any tracks made after that time to have been covered up!\nvon Karma:\nAaah!\nJudge:\nO-Order! Order!\nJudge:\nVery well then... It looks like Ms. von Karma's claim has been... snowed in. Waaaaaah!\nvon Karma:\n...It's too soon to be closing this trial due to snow! Miles Edgeworth! How pathetic of you to rely on the weather of all things!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nvon Karma:\nAnswer me this, then! When is a weather report ever correct!?\nJudge:\nAh, no, no no... You've got it all wrong. This isn't a forecast... This is... actual data... Gyaaaaah!\nvon Karma:\nForecast, data, all weather reports have some inaccuracies! It may have still been snowing in the vicinity well past 11 PM!\nJudge:\nHmmmm... It's true. We cannot be totally sure, eh!\nEdgeworth:\nW-What!? (How did she pull that off!?)\nJudge:\n\"It had stopped snowing at Hazakura Temple when the murder took place.\" ...You need to provide conclusive evidence of this.\nEdgeworth:\n(I've come this far... There's no turning back now.) ...Very well. I, too, cannot allow any doubt to remain concerning this testimony.\nvon Karma:\nHah... You can't back down, can you? Such a perfectionist, Miles Edgeworth!\nJudge:\nVery well then... Mr. Edgeworth! Where is your evidence that it had already stopped snowing when the victim was killed!?\n\n\n\nPresent Crime Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ultimately, it all comes down to one point.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nJudge:\n... Your response, Ms. von Karma?\nvon Karma:\nIt looks like... It is still snowing in your heart, too. Shivering in the cold, you are closing your eyes to the truth...\nEdgeworth:\n...!\nJudge:\nAnd to think you just arrived after a long, tiring flight from Germany. That was poetry. Pure poetry.\nEdgeworth:\n(This evidence is only going to freeze my case solid.)\nvon Karma:\nRespond! Miles Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nEven if it is snowing in my heart... At the time of the murder... it had already stopped snowing at Hazakura Temple!\nLeads back to:\n\"Very well then... Mr. Edgeworth!\"Present Crime Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ultimately, it all comes down to one point.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nHere is the evidence! What do you have to say, Your Honor...?\nJudge:\n... ...This reminds me of when I was a little hockey goon in training... When I was a child, I hoped for school to be canceled due to heavy snowfall. Perhaps, Mr. Edgeworth, it would've been better for you had court been snowed in. ...That's all this evidence says to me, in any case.\nEdgeworth:\n... Nothing else...?\nJudge:\nNothing else.\nvon Karma:\nOh dear... You seem to have missed, Miles Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nNngh...!\nEdgeworth:\n(According to the witness's testimony, the incident occurred after 11 PM... In which case... ...there has to be evidence that can undeniably prove something doesn't match up!)\nLeads back to:\n\"On the night of the murder the killer went to, and returned from, Dusky Bridge...\"Edgeworth:\nUltimately, it all comes down to one point. That being... Whether or not it was snowing in that courtyard when the victim was stabbed...von Karma:\nThat's right. But proving that is...Edgeworth:\nIncredibly easy.von Karma:\n...!Edgeworth:\nIf we want to know whether it was snowing or not, this photo will tell us everything. Of course, I am referring to the photo of the crime scene. As you can see... everything is covered with snow. ...With just one exception.von Karma:\nAnd that is...?Edgeworth:\nThe victim herself, Ms. Elise Deauxnim! Why is there no snow on top of her...? The answer is simple! It had stopped snowing when she was killed, that's why!von Karma:\nGnnngh!Edgeworth:\nIn other words! If the killer really did go to the Eagle River to dispose of the murder weapon... ...then in this photograph, there should be two sets of tracks!von Karma:\nAaaaah!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Just what are you... Gyahaah!von Karma:\nJ-Just what are you suggesting, Miles Edgeworth!?Edgeworth:\n(To be honest... I am not entirely sure myself. But...) This is simply what all of the facts point to. That night... someone used the snowmobile to leave Hazakura Temple. From the tracks left, it can be understood that they were heading for Dusky Bridge. At that time... it was still snowing.von Karma:\nOf course it was. Because those tracks were erased by the snow. (Changed from [Of course it was. Because those tracks were gone.] in the original release)Edgeworth:\nThen when this person returned to Hazakura Temple... ...the snow had stopped. Thus, the return tracks remained.Judge:\nHmmmmm...Bikini:\nCan I say something? This all sounds a bit fishy to me...von Karma:\n...What does, Sister?Bikini:\nThere is only one key for the snowmobile.Edgeworth:\n...!von Karma:\nFurthermore, on the night in question, we know that the defendant had it! The key was found in her room after the murder!Bikini:\n...Which can only mean, that night... Iris used the snowmobile to go to the Inner Temple...Edgeworth:\n(But... Iris said that she never went there... I should probably press on this point some more when I get the chance...)Bikini:\nThe snowmobile can't cross the suspension bridge... So, she must have left it on the Hazakura side of the bridge and crossed on foot.Judge:\n...That sounds right.Bikini:\nBut... What's odd is, when I left Iris and returned to Hazakura Temple... I didn't see anything near Dusky Bridge.von Karma:\nY-You must have just failed to see it, Sister.Bikini:\nMaybe... But when I made it back to Hazakura Temple... ...it was there, by the Main Gate... The snowmobile, I mean. I know what I saw. It was covered in snow, too...Edgeworth:\nB-But that... isn't possible!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order in the court! ...What does this all mean?von Karma:\n...Nngh...Edgeworth:\nSo then what was the snowmobile used for...? It wasn't taken by the defendant when she went to the Inner Temple. If it had been, then the witness couldn't possibly have seen it by the gate. Furthermore... it wasn't used by the killer to dispose of the murder weapon. If that was the case, there should be two sets of tracks in this photo. All we know is this... After it stopped snowing... someone used the snowmobile to return to Hazakura Temple!Judge:\nHmmmmmm...Edgeworth:\n(I never thought a simple snowmobile could cause so much trouble...)Judge:\n...

I've told you everything -- everything that I know.Judge:\nBut then... that still leaves us with the same problem. (Changed from [Well then... That still leaves us with the same problem.] in the original release) If only there was someone... A witness who could testify to having seen the snowmobile!Edgeworth:\n(A witness, huh...)Judge:\nWas there no one out, walking perhaps, near Dusky Bridge on that night?Bikini:\n... I don't think that's likely. It was cold enough to freeze your ears off. Only an idiot would go out wandering in that. ...Unless they had something really important to do.Judge:\nHmmmm... That's a shame.Edgeworth:\n(Hold on... Something is coming to me... An idiot may well have gone wandering out on that sub-arctic night!) ...Your Honor! Actually... there just might be one individual who may be of help to us. (Changed from [I actually have an idea... There may be one individual able to help us.] in the original release)Judge:\nR-Really!?von Karma:\n...You know of someone who might have seen the snowmobile on the night of the murder...?Edgeworth:\nI don't know for sure if he saw it or not... But there are two things about him that do come to mind.Judge:\nWhich are...?Edgeworth:\nFirst... that he saw \"something incredible\" on the night of the murder.von Karma:\n...And the second being?Edgeworth:\nThis individual that I am thinking of went wandering outside on that cold night... In other words, he is our kind of idiot.Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth!

Aaah!\nvon Karma:\nYou're the wandering idiot, Miles Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nCool off before you try to take me on again! Ungh...! (What was I thinking!? This is the perfect chance to drag him onto the stand!)\nJudge:\nHmmmm... Mr. Edgeworth. This individual...

The student of the victim, Elise Deauxnim.Judge:\nHer student...? Interesting. Why was he wandering on the night of the murder?Edgeworth:\nT-That's... (I could tell them all about his designs for Iris... But it may cost us his credibility as a witness... Before I even call him.) He is, after all, an artist. He was, perhaps, searching for something in the snowy scenery that would move him. ...Although I cannot guarantee that this is the reason.von Karma:\nAnd so...? This unfortunate, unreliable-looking man... What exactly was it that he saw?Edgeworth:\nI intend to extract that from him, right here in this courtroom.Judge:\nSummon this youth as a witness immediately!von Karma:\n... I have no choice, do I?Edgeworth:\nI believe he is in the gallery for this trial. It will not take long to summon him.Judge:\n...Very well.Edgeworth:\n(Larry... You may have escaped me yesterday... But today I'm going to get everything out of you!)Judge:\n...The court will now adjourn for a 20 minute break.

Court is now in recess!To be continued.February 9, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Iris:\nExcuse me... Mr. Edgeworth? I'm not really sure what to say...Edgeworth:\nIris. We only have 20 minutes. There are two things which I need to ask you before we reconvene.Iris:\n...Alright. I'll help you any way I can.Edgeworth:\nFirst, about that night. You really didn't go to the Inner Temple, correct? The last witness claims to have met and talked with you in the Training Hall. Either you or Sister Bikini... ...is lying.Iris:\n... Mr. Edgeworth. It is just as I said yesterday. Until the incident occurred... I was in my own room, in Hazakura Temple.Edgeworth:\n...Very well. The second thing, then. That night, the temple snowmobile was used in between the time Sister Bikini... ...returned to the Main Hall and when she bore witness to the murder. Sometime between 10:30 and 11 PM that night. Were you the one who used the snowmobile?Iris:\n... There is only one key for the snowmobile. The only person who could have used it... was me.Edgeworth:\nSo it was you...! But... why? ...What made you go out to Dusky Bridge?Iris:\n... I'm sorry, Mr. Edgeworth.5 PSYCHE-LOCKSEdgeworth:\nIris...Iris:\nI can't... tell you about that... yet.Edgeworth:\n\"Yet\"...?Iris:\nNot until her safety is confirmed...Edgeworth:\nHer?Iris:\nThe safety of the acolyte...Edgeworth:\n(The \"acolyte\", huh... She's must be talking about Maya...) ... Iris. Look me in the eye and tell me the truth. Did you kill Elise Deauxnim?Iris:\n... No matter who or what may come... I could never take a life.Edgeworth:\n... (As I thought... no Psycholocks...) ...Very well. It is my job to get to the truth. You'll discover this for yourself soon enough.February 9, 11:36 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 7Judge:\n...Court will now reconvene. Ms. von Karma. Where is the witness...?von Karma:\nDuring the break, a man was detained for suspicious behavior in the gallery.Edgeworth:\nSuspicious behavior...?von Karma:\nHe was sketching something... Very intensely.Judge:\nDare I ask what the witness was sketching when he was detained?von Karma:\nHe drew a terrifying woman, armed with a demonic face and a vicious whip.Judge:\n... I can only presume that his intention was to capture you-- ...Aaaah!von Karma:\nAnyway, it's time to drag this pathetic excuse for an artist before the court! Laurice Deauxnim! I hope you're ready... Get in here!Edgeworth:\n(It would seem that whip is going to see plenty more use today...)Butz:\nOuch!von Karma:\n...Your sketch is in contempt of this court!Butz:\nH-Hey! I was just artistically rendering... Ou-Ouch!von Karma:\nYou tried to run away from the bailiff who was trying to hand you your subpoena, correct?Butz:\nL-Look! I'm nothing but a fledgling artist, training out in the mountains! I'm only down here in the city because I ran out of green paint. Well, to use the technical term for the color, \"viridian\".Edgeworth:\n...Larry... This isn't an art store, now is it...?Butz:\nI know! I graduated junior high, OK!? Look. Art is all about working in the fields, isn't it?Judge:\nWorking in the fields...?Edgeworth:\nI presume he wanted to say \"field work\"... I hope.Butz:\nTh-That's it! Thanks, buddy!Edgeworth:\n(It's kind of sad that I was able to understand his mangled train wreck of a sentence...)Butz:\nI just happened to stop in here and found a wonderful new model!von Karma:\n...Butz:\nSo see!? I've got nothing to do with this trial! At all! I expect all of your faces to be red when you realize this mistake! Bright red! Or, to use the technical term, \"crimson lake\". ...Ou-Ou-Ouch! Ou-Ou-Ou-Ouch! Ouch!Judge:\nOu-Ou-Ou-Ouch! Ouch! Ou-Ouch!von Karma:\nStop your pathetic blabbing and testify like a man!Judge:\nRefrain from whipping me, Ms. von Karma! Cross-whipping is as bad as cross-checking. Witness! That was all your fault! Testify, now!Butz:\nWaaaah... This is almost too much for me...!Witness Testimony-- What I Saw --Butz:\nI was at that lodge out in the mountains, looking up at the stars that night.\nI walked to the bridge a number of times, but...\nI didn't see a s-snowmobile!\nI didn't see anyone at the bridge that night either!

Aren't I, Edgeyyyyy...!?Judge:\nWitness! Please refrain from talking directly to the lawyers during your testimony!Butz:\nI-I'm just a nobody! Nothing but a small, worthless man, aren't I!? And why wasn't I asked for my name and occupation... or anything else...!?Judge:\n... Mr. Edgeworth. This man seems to have quite a severe inferiority complex.Edgeworth:\n...He's recently been the cause of numerous incidents. I think he's finally realized for himself... ...just how much of a nuisance he has been to other people!Butz:\nYeah, that's right! I'm behind everything, every case! Watch out, OK! Just touching me will make you eternally unhappy!Judge:\n...Well then, let us proceed with the cross-examination. With no touching, thank you. We can delve into other details at a later time.Cross Examination-- What I Saw --Butz:\nI was at that lodge out in the mountains, looking up at the stars that night.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...\nJudge:\nWhat ever is the matter, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nThis one single statement is so full of contradictions... For a moment there, I thought I was going to collapse.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nvon Karma:\nSo, witness? Any idea as to where these contradictions in your testimony lie? Depending on your answer... I may let my whip have its way.\nButz:\nOK, give me a minute... Well, it was snowing that night so I couldn't possibly have seen the stars. That run-down shack is hardly a \"lodge\", is it...? And even if the stars could be seen, it isn't like I was there to look at them, right?\nEdgeworth:\n...\nvon Karma:\nSee? You can do it if you try.\nButz:\nHeh heh heh... Ou-Ou-Ou-Ouch!\nvon Karma:\n...There is only one issue here. What you saw at Dusky Bridge.Butz:\nI walked to the bridge a number of times, but...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n\"A number of times\"...? How many?\nButz:\nMaybe... five times? I went once every twenty minutes.\nEdgeworth:\nWhich means... ...you spent almost two hours at Heavenly Hall that night?\nButz:\nYou bet! Real love is about waiting with your heart in your hands!\nJudge:\nLove, you say...?\nEdgeworth:\nIt was this man's intention to summon the defendant to the small shack. ...Using this blackmail letter.\nJudge:\nB-Blackmail...!?\nButz:\nNo, no! That was simply a product of overflowing love... A-Agh!\nvon Karma:\nYou huffy, puffy, loosey-goosey excuse for a whimpering whining wuss of a witness!\nJudge:\nSo... what did you see? I hope for your sake you saw a snowmobile... You huffy, puffy, loosey-goosey excuse for a whimpering whining wuss of a witness, eh!\nButz:\nUm... well... You see...\nEdgeworth:\n(Being called those names doesn't seem to bother him at all...)Butz:\nI didn't see a s-snowmobile!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Larry! You really didn't see it?\nButz:\nH-H-Hey! No need to hit your desk! I can hear you! ...I didn't see it! I didn't see a s-s-snowmobile!\nEdgeworth:\n... Larry. Say \"snowmobile\" for me, please?\nButz:\nS-S-S-Snowmobile.\nEdgeworth:\nIf you truly have nothing to hide... ...then why are you stammering like you just flew over a cuckoo's nest!?\nButz:\nSh-Shut up! W-W-What is this!? I don't know! Don't ask me!\nEdgeworth:\n(It seems that I'll need to start from a more obvious contradiction. I'm going to strike the blow that will finally get him to spill the beans!)Butz:\nI didn't see anyone at the bridge that night either! (Changed from [I didn't meet anyone at the bridge that night!] in the original release)Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou didn't meet anyone?\nButz:\nThat's right. Because I've got nothing to do with this! And I'm just here to buy some viridian paint, OK!? Come on, I expect to see those crimson lake faces! Now!\nJudge:\n... It would appear that simply pressing him isn't going to be enough, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\n...Indeed.Present Phoenix Wright profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Larry Butz...\"Edgeworth:\n(It seems that he's going to claim to have nothing to do with this to the end. I don't want this guy to cost us any more time... I need to slice through his obvious contradictions and keep things moving along...)Edgeworth:\nLarry Butz... I can understand why you might want to throw your old life away. You're pretty pathetic, and you cause all sorts of trouble...Butz:\nI'm sorry...!Edgeworth:\nBut... Having realized just how much of a nuisance you have been... ...that could be considered a step in the right direction.Butz:\nEdgey! Are you... trying to console me?Judge:\nIt certainly doesn't sound that way to me.Edgeworth:\nHowever... I cannot forgive you for simply turning away from the incidents you create!Butz:\nWaaah... You're totally pinning this on me...Edgeworth:\n...Now then. Let us talk about the night of the murder. Sister Bikini, after seeing the murder take place, asked Phoenix Wright to report it. Thus, he headed for the public phone by the bridge... There, he happened across a certain nefarious individual! You, Larry Butz!Butz:\n... That's right. Me, in the flesh.Judge:\nHmm... Listen carefully, witness. It doesn't matter if you change your name. So long as you remain pretty pathetic, you will continue to cause these incidents! That reality will not change!Butz:\nB-But...! What do you want me to do, then!?Edgeworth:\nLarry. What you need to change is your inner self. But for now... (Changed from [Larry. What you need to change is your inner self.] in the original release) \"What you saw that night\"... Testifying truthfully about this one issue is all I need from you. (Changed from [Testify truthfully! That is all you can do for now.] in the original release)Butz:\n... Edgey... I... I think... I've finally woken up! ... Well. I guess I could still be sleeping... But anyway! I'll do it! I'll testify! ... Well. I'm not sure this'll go especially well...Judge:\nI'll ask again, then, witness. What did you see on the night of the murder?Witness Testimony-- What I Saw, Pt. 2 --Butz:\nI went to the shack at around 9, so it would have been about 10:30 PM...\nI was lying under my bedding when a white flash almost blinded me!\nI looked out the window... and Dusky Bridge was on fire!\nThere was still some thunder, but I went right away to check it out.\nThat's when I ran into Nick.Judge:\nHmmmm... You certainly saw quite a lot, didn't you?von Karma:\nSo... what happened to the bridge after it caught on fire?Butz:\nIt was like me after a three-day stint chasing a girl... It totally burnt out. Like, almost totally gone. ...I mean, trying to cross the burning remains was what caused Nick to fall.von Karma:\nW-What did you say!?Edgeworth:\nOh, don't worry... It's nothing life-threatening. He just caught a cold. (Changed from [Oh, don't worry... nothing life-threatening. He just caught a cold.] in the original release)von Karma:\n...I never know with that man if he should be called lucky or unlucky... (Changed from [As always, hard to know if he should be called lucky or unlucky...] in the original release)Judge:\nNow, Mr. Edgeworth! Please commence your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- What I Saw, Pt. 2 --Butz:\nI went to the shack at around 9, so it would have been about 10:30 PM...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat did you do out there in the cold for an hour and a half?\nButz:\nWell, if you really must know... I was busy being excited. I guess.\nJudge:\nHmmmmm... \"Excited\"? Dare I even ask...?\nButz:\nI set the meeting time as 10:00 PM, right? But I couldn't wait. And I thought she might come early, too.\nEdgeworth:\n...Well, it appears she didn't come at all, in the end.\nvon Karma:\nBecause they never arranged to meet in the first place, did they?\nButz:\nShut up! Don't go picking my fond memories apart! Anyway, I was getting a little worried. I thought maybe Iris had lost her way. So every twenty minutes or so, I went out to the bridge. But I didn't see anything particularly suspicious... I didn't have anything else to do, so I went back to the shack to wait for her.Butz:\nI was lying under my bedding when a white flash almost blinded me!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis \"light\" was, of course...\nButz:\nLightning. Like... KERPOW! Like a slap from Naomi, honestly! A big bada-boom! Hagaaaaah!\nvon Karma:\n...Or a little like that?\nButz:\nWaaah! That's more like a punch from Miranda!\nJudge:\nWitness, did you actually see the lightning hit the bridge?\nButz:\nWell, I was a bit startled by the flash of light, so...Butz:\nI looked out the window... and Dusky Bridge was on fire!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nSeeing that, what did you do?\nButz:\nWhat do you think!? I was burning up as well! From the fire in my heart!\nvon Karma:\nAnd that's why you went to take a look at the bridge?\nButz:\nWell. To be honest... It was freezing cold, so at first I thought, \"Forget it. I'm not leaving my covers.\" But it had pretty much stopped snowing... So, I dunno, I changed my mind.\nJudge:\nHmmmmmm. I'm not sure I care for the \"forget it\" attitude you had at first, witness.Butz:\nThere was still some thunder, but I went right away to check it out.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou said \"right away\"... But exactly how long after the strike was that?\nButz:\nHmm... The lightning fell, and then the bridge caught on fire... Maybe around five minutes? I mean. I suddenly thought, \"Gotta go check this out!\"\nvon Karma:\nHow far is this small shack you were in from the bridge?\nButz:\nHold on... Well, it had pretty much stopped snowing... I guess about a five-minute walk?\nEdgeworth:\nAnd how did Dusky Bridge look when you got there?\nButz:\nLike I had recovered a piece of my childhood. I mean, not even the bonfires kids make during school camping trips can compare!\nEdgeworth:\n(...Well? Should I press him for a little more info?)\n\n\n\nNot right now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I don't think we can expect any more relevant information... Probably best to turn to other leads.)\nJudge:\n...Witness. Please continue your testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nWhy didn't you call anyone?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Larry. Let me ask you one thing.\nButz:\nWhat is it, Edgey? What's with the serious face?\nEdgeworth:\nWhy didn't you call anyone?\nButz:\nHuh? What do you mean? (Changed from [Eh? What do you mean?] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\nNormally... when faced with a \"towering inferno\", one would try and tell someone. There is a public phone right by Dusky Bridge, correct?\nButz:\n... Well, of course I thought of doing that.\nJudge:\nSo then... let's hear why you didn't!\nButz:\nH-Huh? Yeah, OK. A reason... My reason... It isn't that I didn't try to tell anyone... I just didn't have time to, OK?\nChanges statement from \"That's when I ran into Nick.\" or \"I thought I'd never get another chance to see something so big burning!\" to \"I arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later.\"\n\n\n\n\nWhy did you go to the bridge?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo you suddenly thought to \"check out\" the bridge...? Does this mean that you initially had no intention of doing so?\nButz:\nW-Well... Yeah, I guess it does... It was really cold... I didn't really want to go out there.\nEdgeworth:\nIf that's the case... Why did you change your mind? I would like to hear your reasoning.\nJudge:\nIn which case... please give testimony to that effect, witness!\nButz:\nM-My reasoning... OK... Reasoning, is it...?\nChanges statement from \"That's when I ran into Nick.\" or \"I arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later.\" to \"I thought I'd never get another chance to see something so big burning!\"Butz:\nThat's when I ran into Nick.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nHow did Phoenix Wright look when you met him?\nButz:\nHmm... He looked like a beaten up mule. He was dead tired. I mean, he had run all the way from Hazakura Temple. He simply stood, staring at me, breathing hard for a moment.\nvon Karma:\nHow far is it to Hazakura Temple from the bridge?\nButz:\nOn his legs... a 15 minute run, I'd say.\nJudge:\n...And that's when the murder was reported?\nButz:\nThat's right! And then he took a fall from the bridge!Butz:\nI arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou claim to have arrived at the bridge at the same time as Wright?\nButz:\nY-Yeah! I thought, \"I'd better tell someone about this.\" But then Nick came up yelling about murder! It totally made me forget about the bridge. The fire was pretty much out by then, anyway.\nEdgeworth:\n(What's this feeling...? I suddenly have a terrible case of unease...!)\nvon Karma:\nIt was after contacting the police that Phoenix Wright fell from the bridge, correct?\nButz:\nYeah. That's pretty much it. More or less.Present Weather Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Your very existence being a contradiction, I'm not sure if you can grasp this or not...\"Butz:\nI thought I'd never get another chance to see something so big burning!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...So you decided to go and see what was happening?\nButz:\nThat's right! We're talking about a massive suspension bridge burning to high heaven! That's not something you see every day. A real spec... specule... ... Like, really special?\nEdgeworth:\n(Can we really trust a witness who is unable to pronounce \"spectacle\"?)\nJudge:\nLife seems to love hitting this poor witness below the belt...\nButz:\nWell, my motto is to \"hit life back as hard as I can.\" A-Agah!\nvon Karma:\n...I'll give you a few hits too, if you'd like. With my whip.Edgeworth:\n(...He told me about the burning bridge yesterday. But there's still something that doesn't quite fit... It looks like... ...despite his change of heart, Larry still isn't telling us the whole truth.)Edgeworth:\nYour very existence being a contradiction, I'm not sure if you can grasp this or not...Butz:\nWhat the hey, Edgey!? You make me sound like some sort of alien!Edgeworth:\nBut your testimony is conclusively contradictory. The problem here... is time.Butz:\nI've never been the best timekeeper, you know. \"Three minutes after Billy leaves on foot, you follow him on your bicycle. How long does it take for you to catch up with him?\" Terrible at those.Edgeworth:\n...This is much more simple. You saw the lightning strike Dusky Bridge... ...and immediately went to see what had happened. ...Is this correct?Butz:\nYeah... Well, I wasted about five minutes first, but more or less.Edgeworth:\n...I have the weather data from the night of the murder here. According to this, the lightning fell at 10:45 PM. You say it takes less than five minutes from the shack to Dusky Bridge. Meaning you probably got there at around 11 PM.Butz:\n...That all sounds about right, I guess. And then Nick showed up and did his falling act.Edgeworth:\nThat is impossible.von Karma:\n...What do you mean?Edgeworth:\n11 PM is when the murder occurred in Hazakura Temple. Thus... Wright was still there, in the courtyard. There is no way that Larry could have encountered him at Dusky Bridge at that time!von Karma:\n...!Butz:\nAh! Excuse me! I-I have an objection!Judge:\nYou do?Butz:\nEdgey! How many times do I have to say this!? I'm not Larry! I'm Laurice Deauxnim! Gyaaah!von Karma:\n...It has not been proven that the murder occurred at 11 PM. The Sister only said, \"around 11\". ...In which case! It could have been earlier than that!Edgeworth:\n...Watch your footing there, Ms. Franziska von Karma. The slope ahead is slippery! For there is still no way that Wright could have been at Dusky Bridge at 11 PM!von Karma:\nAnd why not!?Edgeworth:\nIt is clearly written here in the weather data report. It took around 30 minutes for the bridge to burn out. Therefore! The bridge must have been burning until at least 11:15 PM!Judge:\nWhich means... what, exactly?Edgeworth:\nWright did not see the bridge as it was burning that night. In fact, he did not arrive on the scene until after the flames had died down! (Changed from [He did not arrive there until after the flames had died down!] in the original release; extra space between [had] and [died] in the Trilogy release) ...Larry! You arrived at the bridge at 11 PM. But Wright did not make it there until at least 11:15... (Changed from [Wright did not make it there until at least 11:15...] in the original release) I suggest you to stop hiding things and just tell us the whole truth. Now, then... (Changed from [Are you still trying to hide something from us!?] in the original release) What happened during these missing 15 minutes!?Butz:\nUrk... I... I feel like I just got brutally woken up by toilet splashback... (Changed from [I... I feel like I just woke up...] in the original release) I guess I was still sleeping after all! Ha ha ha! Pinch me!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! Ordaaaaaaaaagh!von Karma:\n...So there was a missing 15 minutes prior to meeting Phoenix Wright. I hardly see that as much of a problem!Butz:\nYeah! Not much of a problem at all!Edgeworth:\nReally...? The bridge is burning before your eyes, and there is a phone right next to it. Why, then, did you not report the accident?Judge:\nYes, witness! Why didn't you!? Were you there simply to watch the bridge burn? (Changed from [Did you simply... watch the bridge burn?] in the original release)Edgeworth:\nAnd therein lies the problem. (Changed from [That is the problem here...] in the original release) For even after the bridge had burnt out, he was still there! (Changed from [Even after the bridge burnt out, he was still there!] in the original release) Staring into space, this witness didn't even attempt to fulfill his civic duty! (Changed from [He simply stood there and didn't report anything.] in the original release)von Karma:\nTh-That's what it sounds like...Edgeworth:\nAh, but this is Larry we are talking about, and even he is incapable of being so stupid. (Changed from [This might be Larry we are talking about, but even he is incapable of being so stupid.] in the original release) Which means there has to be a reason for his inaction! (Changed from [There has to be a reason for his inaction!] in the original release)Butz:\n... Edgey... I think it's about time I got serious with you, dude.Edgeworth:\n...Just as I thought, you've been playing with us all this time.Butz:\nListen... I'm... I'm going to tell you everything! Are you sure you want to hear it all!?Edgeworth:\nY-Yes...Butz:\nI may reeeeally say it this time! Everything! Kahaah!von Karma:\n...Then say it!Judge:\nVery well... I have a terribly bad feeling aboot this; however... ...let's have the witness finally give us the whole truth. Now... for this 15 minute gap, what where you doing, witness!?Witness Testimony-- The Missing 15 Minutes --Butz:\nI'm a Deauxnim. I'm an artist! What do you think I was doing?\nSketching! In front of the bridge! I was whipped up into a frenzy of art!\nThe shock and awe that I was feeling... I transferred it all directly onto the page!\n...Before I realized it, the flames had gone out and then he came running up.Judge:\nHmmmmm... I suppose artists can be strange folk...Butz:\nThat's right! I'm willing to sacrifice everything in order to draw the perfect sketch!Edgeworth:\n(...Including the truth, from the sound of it!)Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth. Has this removed the last of your doubts?Edgeworth:\nNot at all, Your Honor. One very large doubt still remains.Judge:\nAnd what would that be?Edgeworth:\nThis is a surprisingly believable story, especially considering the source... So why did he think he needed to hide it from us until now? I intend to drag the reason out of him!Butz:\nHah ha ha! You'll regret this, Edgey!Cross Examination",

I was busy being excited. I guess.\nJudge:\nHmmmmm... \"Excited\"? Dare I even ask...?\nButz:\nI set the meeting time as 10:00 PM, right? But I couldn't wait. And I thought she might come early, too.\nEdgeworth:\n...Well, it appears she didn't come at all, in the end.\nvon Karma:\nBecause they never arranged to meet in the first place, did they?\nButz:\nShut up! Don't go picking my fond memories apart! Anyway, I was getting a little worried. I thought maybe Iris had lost her way. So every twenty minutes or so, I went out to the bridge. But I didn't see anything particularly suspicious... I didn't have anything else to do, so I went back to the shack to wait for her.Butz:\nI was lying under my bedding when a white flash almost blinded me!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis \"light\" was, of course...\nButz:\nLightning. Like... KERPOW! Like a slap from Naomi, honestly! A big bada-boom! Hagaaaaah!\nvon Karma:\n...Or a little like that?\nButz:\nWaaah! That's more like a punch from Miranda!\nJudge:\nWitness, did you actually see the lightning hit the bridge?\nButz:\nWell, I was a bit startled by the flash of light, so...Butz:\nI looked out the window... and Dusky Bridge was on fire!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nSeeing that, what did you do?\nButz:\nWhat do you think!? I was burning up as well! From the fire in my heart!\nvon Karma:\nAnd that's why you went to take a look at the bridge?\nButz:\nWell. To be honest... It was freezing cold, so at first I thought, \"Forget it. I'm not leaving my covers.\" But it had pretty much stopped snowing... So, I dunno, I changed my mind.\nJudge:\nHmmmmmm. I'm not sure I care for the \"forget it\" attitude you had at first, witness.Butz:\nThere was still some thunder, but I went right away to check it out.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou said \"right away\"... But exactly how long after the strike was that?\nButz:\nHmm... The lightning fell, and then the bridge caught on fire... Maybe around five minutes? I mean. I suddenly thought, \"Gotta go check this out!\"\nvon Karma:\nHow far is this small shack you were in from the bridge?\nButz:\nHold on... Well, it had pretty much stopped snowing... I guess about a five-minute walk?\nEdgeworth:\nAnd how did Dusky Bridge look when you got there?\nButz:\nLike I had recovered a piece of my childhood. I mean, not even the bonfires kids make during school camping trips can compare!\nEdgeworth:\n(...Well? Should I press him for a little more info?)\n\n\n\nNot right now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I don't think we can expect any more relevant information... Probably best to turn to other leads.)\nJudge:\n...Witness. Please continue your testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nWhy didn't you call anyone?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Larry. Let me ask you one thing.\nButz:\nWhat is it, Edgey? What's with the serious face?\nEdgeworth:\nWhy didn't you call anyone?\nButz:\nHuh? What do you mean? (Changed from [Eh? What do you mean?] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\nNormally... when faced with a \"towering inferno\", one would try and tell someone. There is a public phone right by Dusky Bridge, correct?\nButz:\n... Well, of course I thought of doing that.\nJudge:\nSo then... let's hear why you didn't!\nButz:\nH-Huh? Yeah, OK. A reason... My reason... It isn't that I didn't try to tell anyone... I just didn't have time to, OK?\nChanges statement from \"That's when I ran into Nick.\" or \"I thought I'd never get another chance to see something so big burning!\" to \"I arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later.\"\n\n\n\n\nWhy did you go to the bridge?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo you suddenly thought to \"check out\" the bridge...? Does this mean that you initially had no intention of doing so?\nButz:\nW-Well... Yeah, I guess it does... It was really cold... I didn't really want to go out there.\nEdgeworth:\nIf that's the case... Why did you change your mind? I would like to hear your reasoning.\nJudge:\nIn which case... please give testimony to that effect, witness!\nButz:\nM-My reasoning... OK... Reasoning, is it...?\nChanges statement from \"That's when I ran into Nick.\" or \"I arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later.\" to \"I thought I'd never get another chance to see something so big burning!\"Butz:\nThat's when I ran into Nick.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nHow did Phoenix Wright look when you met him?\nButz:\nHmm... He looked like a beaten up mule. He was dead tired. I mean, he had run all the way from Hazakura Temple. He simply stood, staring at me, breathing hard for a moment.\nvon Karma:\nHow far is it to Hazakura Temple from the bridge?\nButz:\nOn his legs... a 15 minute run, I'd say.\nJudge:\n...And that's when the murder was reported?\nButz:\nThat's right! And then he took a fall from the bridge!Butz:\nI arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou claim to have arrived at the bridge at the same time as Wright?\nButz:\nY-Yeah! I thought, \"I'd better tell someone about this.\" But then Nick came up yelling about murder! It totally made me forget about the bridge. The fire was pretty much out by then, anyway.\nEdgeworth:\n(What's this feeling...? I suddenly have a terrible case of unease...!)\nvon Karma:\nIt was after contacting the police that Phoenix Wright fell from the bridge, correct?\nButz:\nYeah. That's pretty much it. More or less.Present Weather Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Your very existence being a contradiction, I'm not sure if you can grasp this or not...\"Butz:\nI thought I'd never get another chance to see something so big burning!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...So you decided to go and see what was happening?\nButz:\nThat's right! We're talking about a massive suspension bridge burning to high heaven! That's not something you see every day. A real spec... specule... ... Like, really special?\nEdgeworth:\n(Can we really trust a witness who is unable to pronounce \"spectacle\"?)\nJudge:\nLife seems to love hitting this poor witness below the belt...\nButz:\nWell, my motto is to \"hit life back as hard as I can.\" A-Agah!\nvon Karma:\n...I'll give you a few hits too, if you'd like. With my whip.Edgeworth:\n(...He told me about the burning bridge yesterday. But there's still something that doesn't quite fit... It looks like... ...despite his change of heart, Larry still isn't telling us the whole truth.)Edgeworth:\nYour very existence being a contradiction, I'm not sure if you can grasp this or not...Butz:\nWhat the hey, Edgey!? You make me sound like some sort of alien!Edgeworth:\nBut your testimony is conclusively contradictory. The problem here... is time.Butz:\nI've never been the best timekeeper, you know. \"Three minutes after Billy leaves on foot, you follow him on your bicycle. How long does it take for you to catch up with him?\" Terrible at those.Edgeworth:\n...This is much more simple. You saw the lightning strike Dusky Bridge... ...and immediately went to see what had happened. ...Is this correct?Butz:\nYeah... Well, I wasted about five minutes first, but more or less.Edgeworth:\n...I have the weather data from the night of the murder here. According to this, the lightning fell at 10:45 PM. You say it takes less than five minutes from the shack to Dusky Bridge. Meaning you probably got there at around 11 PM.Butz:\n...That all sounds about right, I guess. And then Nick showed up and did his falling act.Edgeworth:\nThat is impossible.von Karma:\n...What do you mean?Edgeworth:\n11 PM is when the murder occurred in Hazakura Temple. Thus... Wright was still there, in the courtyard. There is no way that Larry could have encountered him at Dusky Bridge at that time!von Karma:\n...!Butz:\nAh! Excuse me! I-I have an objection!Judge:\nYou do?Butz:\nEdgey! How many times do I have to say this!? I'm not Larry! I'm Laurice Deauxnim! Gyaaah!von Karma:\n...It has not been proven that the murder occurred at 11 PM. The Sister only said, \"around 11\". ...In which case! It could have been earlier than that!Edgeworth:\n...Watch your footing there, Ms. Franziska von Karma. The slope ahead is slippery! For there is still no way that Wright could have been at Dusky Bridge at 11 PM!von Karma:\nAnd why not!?Edgeworth:\nIt is clearly written here in the weather data report. It took around 30 minutes for the bridge to burn out. Therefore! The bridge must have been burning until at least 11:15 PM!Judge:\nWhich means... what, exactly?Edgeworth:\nWright did not see the bridge as it was burning that night. In fact, he did not arrive on the scene until after the flames had died down! (Changed from [He did not arrive there until after the flames had died down!] in the original release; extra space between [had] and [died] in the Trilogy release) ...Larry! You arrived at the bridge at 11 PM. But Wright did not make it there until at least 11:15... (Changed from [Wright did not make it there until at least 11:15...] in the original release) I suggest you to stop hiding things and just tell us the whole truth. Now, then... (Changed from [Are you still trying to hide something from us!?] in the original release) What happened during these missing 15 minutes!?Butz:\nUrk... I... I feel like I just got brutally woken up by toilet splashback... (Changed from [I... I feel like I just woke up...] in the original release) I guess I was still sleeping after all! Ha ha ha! Pinch me!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! Ordaaaaaaaaagh!von Karma:\n...So there was a missing 15 minutes prior to meeting Phoenix Wright. I hardly see that as much of a problem!Butz:\nYeah! Not much of a problem at all!Edgeworth:\nReally...? The bridge is burning before your eyes, and there is a phone right next to it. Why, then, did you not report the accident?Judge:\nYes, witness! Why didn't you!? Were you there simply to watch the bridge burn? (Changed from [Did you simply... watch the bridge burn?] in the original release)Edgeworth:\nAnd therein lies the problem. (Changed from [That is the problem here...] in the original release) For even after the bridge had burnt out, he was still there! (Changed from [Even after the bridge burnt out, he was still there!] in the original release) Staring into space, this witness didn't even attempt to fulfill his civic duty! (Changed from [He simply stood there and didn't report anything.] in the original release)von Karma:\nTh-That's what it sounds like...Edgeworth:\nAh, but this is Larry we are talking about, and even he is incapable of being so stupid. (Changed from [This might be Larry we are talking about, but even he is incapable of being so stupid.] in the original release) Which means there has to be a reason for his inaction! (Changed from [There has to be a reason for his inaction!] in the original release)Butz:\n... Edgey... I think it's about time I got serious with you, dude.Edgeworth:\n...Just as I thought, you've been playing with us all this time.Butz:\nListen... I'm... I'm going to tell you everything! Are you sure you want to hear it all!?Edgeworth:\nY-Yes...Butz:\nI may reeeeally say it this time! Everything! Kahaah!von Karma:\n...Then say it!Judge:\nVery well... I have a terribly bad feeling aboot this; however... ...let's have the witness finally give us the whole truth. Now... for this 15 minute gap, what where you doing, witness!?Witness Testimony-- The Missing 15 Minutes --Butz:\nI'm a Deauxnim. I'm an artist! What do you think I was doing?\nSketching! In front of the bridge! I was whipped up into a frenzy of art!\nThe shock and awe that I was feeling... I transferred it all directly onto the page!\n...Before I realized it, the flames had gone out and then he came running up.Judge:\nHmmmmm... I suppose artists can be strange folk...Butz:\nThat's right! I'm willing to sacrifice everything in order to draw the perfect sketch!Edgeworth:\n(...Including the truth, from the sound of it!)Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth. Has this removed the last of your doubts?Edgeworth:\nNot at all, Your Honor. One very large doubt still remains.Judge:\nAnd what would that be?Edgeworth:\nThis is a surprisingly believable story, especially considering the source... So why did he think he needed to hide it from us until now? I intend to drag the reason out of him!Butz:\nHah ha ha! You'll regret this, Edgey!Cross Examination",

The treasured Kurain Village heirloom whose name means \"7 Branched Sword\". It is said that this sacred sword represents life itself. Though the branches may appear to be infinite, the choices limitless... ...like our destinies, the sword comes to but one end. One merciless point. And when the silver cord, the fragile thread that binds us to this world, is severed... ...the illusion is revealed and the implacability of fate is finally laid bare...February 6, 9:48 AMWright & Co. Law OfficesMaya:\nHey, Nick.Phoenix:\nYeah? What is it?Maya:\nYou know how I've got spiritual powers, unlike you?Phoenix:\nUm, sure... You are a spirit medium, after all.Maya:\nBut just like you, if I don't keep my powers sharp, they get dull, right?Phoenix:\nUm... I guess so, yeah.Maya:\nGlad you agree! OK, Pearly! You're up!Phoenix:\n(Pearls...?)Pearl:\nSo! That's why we need to go on a special \"Spiritual Hot Spot Tour\", Mr. Nick!Phoenix:\n...Huh? I'm lost. What's this magazine you're shoving in my face?Pearl:\nIt's the New Year's issue of \"Oh! Cult!\", Winter Spiritual Locations Special!Phoenix:\n...Oh. (Pearls looks so happy.)Maya:\n\"Maximize your spiritual powers with just one night of intensive training!\" ...Oh! It sounds too good to be true!Phoenix:\nI'll say. It sounds more like a scam to me.Maya:\nIt's at a spiritual retreat called \"Hazakura Temple\". It's way up in the mountains, and I bet it's nice and cold. ...Just perfect for training!Phoenix:\n(Now I definitely don't want to go...)Maya:\nYou know, I think I've heard of this temple before. It's a famous channeling dojo. It's hard for even real spirit mediums like us to make reservations up there!Phoenix:\nReservations...? For a temple? Are you serious?Pearl:\nDon't worry! I've already made special reservations, just for us!Maya:\nYeah! And I signed up for the \"Special Course\"!Phoenix:\nTh-That's nice. And the timing couldn't be better. ...Since we don't have a case right now anyway.Maya:\nAlrighty then! It's settled! Well, come on! Don't just stand there! Start packing your stuff!Pearl:\nYes, Mr. Nick! You'd better start packing your stuff!Phoenix:\nHuh...? M-ME!? Why do I have to go!?Maya:\nWell, we have to be accompanied by someone over 20 years old.Phoenix:\nHey! I don't have anything to do with spirit power. The only thing I can channel is a TV. ... So, um, is there a heated pool at this \"Hazakura Temple\"?Pearl:\nNo, but you can stand under a freezing waterfall!Phoenix:\n... Sorry, but I think I'll pass. I hate cold places.Maya:\nWhaaat!? No way! How can you be so selfish!?Pearl:\nCome on, Mr. Nick! Look at this place! Doesn't it look beautiful!?Phoenix:\nNope. Not going. I'm gonna be nice and toasty at home....... .................What the...!?Pearl:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Nick?Phoenix:\nLet me see that magazine! Th-This nun...Maya:\nIs she a friend of yours or something, Nick?Phoenix:\n(Th-This girl... I-It's...!)Dahlia:\nMy name is Dahlia Hawthorne. I just want to say... It's an honor for me to be here in your noble presence.Dahlia:\nHonestly, how can any woman ever count on you for anything? ...You disgust me!Phoenix:\nBut... It can't be! (She was found guilty and should still be in prison...)Pearl:\n...Mr. Nick?Phoenix:\n... I'll go.Maya:\nHuh...?Phoenix:\nHazakura Temple... I said I'll go.Maya:\nYay! Isn't that great, Pearly!?Pearl:\nYes! Oh, thank you! Thank you, Mr. Nick! You'd do anything for Mystic Maya, right? Even walk over burning coals, right!?\"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue received from Pearls.Phoenix:\n(Dahlia Hawthorne... I knew there was no way she could possibly be at that temple... But, I just had to be see for myself... ...who this \"nun\" really was.)February 7, 3:24 PMHazakura TempleMain GateMaya:\nBrrrrr... It-It-It's so c-c-cold here, Nick!Phoenix:\nMaybe you should put on something warmer for a change!Maya:\nW-W-Well, it's supposed to be c-c-cold... It's t-t-training. ...Ah-Achoo!Phoenix:\n(Her teeth are chattering so loudly, it's all I can do to make out what she's saying...)Pearl:\nWow, Mystic Maya! So this is the famous Hazakura Temple!Maya:\nP-P-P-Pearly... I-I-I-I... Ah-Achoo!???:\nWell, well, well... How nice to see you here. Welcome to our temple!Maya:\nOh...! Th-Th-Thank you... Ah-Achoo!???:\nOh my, my, my... Thank you for coming all this way. Come now, come now. You must have been cold.Phoenix:\nWhat's with the past tense...? We're freezing into human popsicles as we spea--!???:\nHo ho ho. Well, we are high up in the mountains after all. In any case, we shouldn't speak here. ...Please follow me inside.Maya:\nTh-Thank you. I was starting to think I would pass--???:\nOh! Yes, yes! I almost forgot to introduce myself.Bikini:\nI'm the head nun here at the temple. My name is Bikini.Maya:\nB-B-B-Bikini...!?Bikini:\nThat's riiight! Actually, that's my \"temple\" name. What do you think? It's a tradition to have one, and I wanted something that has a nice image to it. So I thought, \"Why not choose a bikini?\" Besides, it makes me seem younger. Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho!Maya:\nIt certainly does! Oh, I signed up for your \"Special Course\"!Bikini:\nWell, my, my, my. Quite brave of you considering how cold it is! Young people can be so reckless with their health! Don't blame me if you become one with those you channel. Wa ha ha! Ho ho ho!Pearl:\nR-Reckless...?Maya:\n\"Wa ha ha\"...?Pearl:\nMaybe you should take it easy tonight, Mystic Maya... We can come back another day.Maya:\nBut you went through all that trouble to get reservations for m--Bikini:\nYes, yes, yes, that's right! You've come all this way, so please, enjoy yourselves! There's still time before supper, so why don't you have a look around?Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nWhat do you think, Nick? Pretty awesome gate, huh?\nPhoenix:\nIt sure is... It looks pretty well maintained, too. This thing kinda puts your hometown to shame, Maya.\nMaya:\nYeah... Well, a lot of things have happened in Kurain Village. We used to be a lot richer, back when people hired us to perform channelings.\nPhoenix:\nOh, I see... But now the place looks a bit run down...\nMaya:\nHmm... I guess I was just born in the wrong time.\n\n\n\n\nMain Hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nThat looks like the Main Hall where we'll be staying tonight. From here, it looks like one of those ice hotels you always hear about!\nPhoenix:\n...They gotta have a heater or something in there, don't you think? I don't wanna die.\nMaya:\nI'm not worried, I brought my hot-water bottle.\nPhoenix:\nDid you bring one for me?\nMaya:\nWhat are you talking about, Nick? Who carries around 2 hot-water bottles?\nPhoenix:\n(Brr! If the cold doesn't kill me, the ice queen over here will finish the job...)\n\n\n\n\nBell tower\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nOh, look! It's a cute little bell tower! I absolutely love the sound of a giant bell!\nPhoenix:\nOh? So, which do you like better? That or the sound of money?\nMaya:\n...! ...... Sorry, but I'll take money for the win, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What are you apologizing for?\n\n\n\n\nSnowmobile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nOh look, it's one of those snow motorcycle things!\nPhoenix:\nMost people call that a \"snowmobile\", you know.\nMaya:\n\"Snow motorcycle things\", \"Snowblowmeal\". Same thing. Hmm... Too bad we didn't invite Desirée. I bet she could race like the wind on this \"Slowmobile\"! Or maybe she'd give me ride on this \"Blowsnowbile\".\nPhoenix:\nArgh! I told you, it's \"snowmobile\"!Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanneling dojo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUmm... So what's a \"channeling dojo\" anyway?\nBikini:\nOh my, my, my... You don't even know that?\nMaya:\nForgive him, Sister, for he knows not what he is saying.\nBikini:\nWell, well, well. Just call me Bikini and forget that \"Sister\" part. A channeling dojo is basically a spiritual power training ground. We have special holy items prepared here to help people boost their spiritual power.\nPhoenix:\nH-Holy items...?\nBikini:\nIf you train an entire evening surrounded by these items... Aaah. It's quite mysterious. The spiritual power of these items seems to envelop you. Wa ha ha ha.\nPhoenix:\n(Wow, she must have just gotten off the trolley from the land of make-believe...)\nMaya:\nUm, so what exactly is the \"Special Course\"...?\nBikini:\nYou must be incredibly devoted to be interested in that at such a young age! It's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant a spell... ...30,000 times! All while being showered in freezing cold spirit water.\nMaya:\nEh...?\nBikini:\nIt's February now, right? You have to be careful this time of the year... If you don't watch it, you'll catch pneumonia or maybe even die of hypothermia... So be careful, you hear? Wa ha ha. Ho ho ho. Ha!\nMaya:\nHow am I supposed to \"be careful\"...?\nPearl:\nOh no... I knew I shouldn't have signed Mystic Maya up for this...\n\n\n\n\nThe other nun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUmm, Sister... About this picture...\nBikini:\nWell, well. Look at that. I must say I look rather divine here, don't you think?\nPhoenix:\nOh, um, yeah. Unforgettable in every way.\nBikini:\nYou mean it? Oh, I knew it! Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho ho! The makeup was pretty tough, but Iris helped me out.\nMaya:\n\"Iris\"...?\nBikini:\nThe cute little girl in the photo. She looks just like me, doesn't she? We're just a small temple here, so she and I run the entire place.\nMaya:\nReally? That kinda sounds like fu--\nPhoenix:\nSorry to cut in, but...! This \"Iris\"... Where is she right now?\nBikini:\nOh! Just listen to you! You haven't come all the way up here just to find a girlfriend, have you?\nPearl:\n... *glare*\nPhoenix:\nNo, no, no! Th-That's not what I had in mind at all...\nBikini:\nAnyway, Iris is in the Inner Temple preparing for this evening.\nMaya:\nInner Temple...?\nBikini:\nYes, yes, that's right. Iris will be back this evening. Why don't you go have a look at the Main Hall for now? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha.\nPhoenix:\n(So she's in the Inner Temple, huh...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm, do you think you could take a look at this?\nBikini:\nI may not look like it, but I can tell you I'm very much in demand. And to be quite honest, I'm finding this a little difficult to say...\nPearl:\n...What IS she trying to say, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI think she's trying to say that she's busy.\nMaya:\nBut seriously Nick, what's the deal? Nothing has even happened yet and you're already shoving evidence into people's faces. You need to forget about work and relax a little.\nPearl:\nTry to have some fun, OK Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, you're right... (Sure. Pin the hypothermia on the lawyer is great fun!)February 7Hazakura TempleMain HallMaya:\nBrr... It's fr-freezing in here, too! Achoo!Pearl:\nHee hee. It reminds me of the Meditation Room in Fey Manor!Phoenix:\n...Pearls, you've been in an unusually good mood since we got here.Pearl:\nWell, kids are made of energy, you know!Phoenix:\nAs for you, Maya, you look like you're about to catch a bad cold.Maya:\nW-W-Well, I'm not exactly a little kid anymore, I guess. Ah-Achoo!Phoenix:\n(Nngh... Is she going to make it...?)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSliding doors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI bet the writing on these sliding doors are instructions for spirit channeling... Kinda like how we scribbled math formulas on the bathroom walls to remember them. Except we couldn't go to the bathroom during tests... And I can't read these walls.\n\n\n\n\nObjects on floor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere are straw zabuton cushions arranged around a hibachi brazier... I haven't seen a layout like this since I saw this really old Japanese movie on TV. ...If it wasn't for this hibachi, they'd probably freeze to death.\n\n\n\n\nAltar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's an altar. It looks a bit old, but someone does a good job taking care of it. Speaking of altars, I remember seeing one like this in Kurain Village last year. I guess they really do have something to do with spiritual power after all.\n\n\n\n\nMagatama on altar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere's a laughably large Magatama on the altar. If I can see Psyche-Locks with the tiny Magatama I've got... ...I can only imagine what kind of power this bad boy has under his hood!\n\n\n\n\nLeft corner near altar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's a stack of straw zabuton cushions. Maya told me this type of zabuton is called \"enza\"... I suppose if I'd never come here, I'd have missed out on all these new things.February 7Suspension BridgeMaya:\nWow! Look at this broken down old bridge, Nick!Phoenix:\nY-Yeah, and look at that big canyon below us.Maya:\nHey! There's a river down there! It looks like it's flowing real fast! ...What's wrong, Nick? You look like you've seen a ghost!Phoenix:\nI-I'm just not very good with heights...Maya:\nOh... Hey! I've got it! Maybe you should face your fear and try hurling yourself off the edge? You know! One... Two... Three... Jump! It might be just what you need to get over your fear of heights!Phoenix:\n...Yeah, death is a real good way to overcome phobias alright. Anyway, it sure looks like a rickety bridge.Maya:\nCan't argue there. That's probably why it's called, \"Dusty Bridge\".Phoenix:\nRead it again, Maya. It says, \"Dusky Bridge\".Maya:\nWell, it's practically the same thing.Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCliff on opposite side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like it's about 20 yards to that cliff over there.\nMaya:\nI guess that's where I'll be training tonight. Do you want to train with me, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nAnd do the Special Course? I think not.\nMaya:\nBut it'd be so great if you had spiritual powers, too! (Really? \"I see dead people\" sounds more like a cause for alarm to me...)\n\n\n\n\nWooden sign on left side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere's a narrow path going off in a different direction than that of the Main Hall.\nMaya:\nThe sign here is so old, the text seems to have vanished.\nPhoenix:\nThe path leads to a wooden staircase that goes down to the bottom of the canyon.\nMaya:\nOK, I'll write, \"wooden staircase\" on it then.\nPhoenix:\n...Do you really think that is necessary? You'd have to be blind not to see the stairs.\nMaya:\nWell, it can't hurt. Just pass me a pencil, OK?\nPhoenix:\nGraffiti is a crime, Maya.\n\n\n\n\nBridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! Why don't we hop across the bridge. It'll be fun!\nPhoenix:\nI'm not so sure... It looks like a bunny hopping across the bridge would destroy it.\nMaya:\nOK, Nick. Then let's try to find a cute little white bunny and test your theory.\nPhoenix:\n(That right there sums up the fundamental difference between sane and insane.)\n\n\n\n\nBoulder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSome letters are engraved into a roughly cut boulder.\nMaya:\n\"D-U-S-T-Y Bridge\", huh?\nPhoenix:\nIt says, \"Dusky\"! \"Dusky Bridge\"! OK?\nMaya:\nC'mon, Nick! Take a look at that bridge and tell me it's not supposed to be \"Dusty\"! This sign is obviously wrong, and I'm gonna fix it! Now give me a pencil, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nDo I look like a pencil holder to you?\n\n\n\n\nPublic phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nI can't believe there's a public phone here. Who would ever use it?\nPhoenix:\nThe people who live here, I guess. I doubt they have any real phones there.\nMaya:\nYeah, but it took like 20 minutes to walk here from the Main Hall! ... It would've been smarter of them to build the Main Hall here, don't you think?\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe you should work on channeling someone who makes logical sense, Maya.After clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate:February 7Hazakura TempleMain HallMaya:\nTh-Th-The Main Hall... I th-think it's even c-c-c-colder in here! Achoo!Pearl:\nAh! Mr. Nick! Do you smell that? It smells like meat and gravy!Maya:\nYeah, you're right! I guess it's pot roast for tonight! Yum!Phoenix:\n...Weird. I thought they would serve something a little more... well, traditional.Maya:\nWhat are you talking about, Nick!? You think monks and nuns just sit around eating rice gruel all the time!?Pearl:\nMystic Maya is right! Ooh! I hope there's mashed potatoes, too! I love mashed potatoes!???:\nHa ha ha... What a cute little acolyte! Greetings to all of you.Phoenix:\nOh... Um, hello. (Wow, this lady makes Maya look like a 6.8/10 on the weirdness scale.)Maya:\nYour outfit... Did you come here for the Special Course, too...????:\nHa, ha, ha... Unfortunately, no. Actually, I'm...Pearl:\nAaaaaaaaaah! Y-You're...! Y-You're...! You're Ms. Elise Deauxnim!Elise:\nYes, that's right... You know of me?Pearl:\nM-M-My name... My name is Pearl Fey! I-I'm your biggest fan!Maya:\nWho is she, Nick?Phoenix:\nHmm... I see it now... Zvarri! A fortune-teller...?Pearl:\nI-I've got all your books, Ms. Deauxnim!Elise:\nHa, ha, ha... What a sweet thing to say. And please, call me Elise.Phoenix:\nUm, \"books\"...?Pearl:\nMr. Nick, don't you know anything!? Don't you even know who this is?Phoenix:\nWell, um... ...An author, maybe?Elise:\nYes, and an illustrator. ...Of picture books.Maya:\nPicture books, huh? Oh, now I get it...Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElise Deauxnim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... I'm sorry I didn't know who you are. I don't get a lot of chances to really enjoy picture books.\nElise:\nIt's alright. I take no offense to that. My books are nothing but simple stories for children.\nPearl:\nAnd really beautiful pictures too, Ms. Elise! Your books always make me feel as if my heart has been purified.\nElise:\nHa ha ha... It makes me feel very happy to hear you say that.\nPhoenix:\n(I do have to admit... She certainly seems like a kind, sensitive lady.)\nPearl:\nMs. Elise won an award last year for her book, \"The Magic Bottle\"!\nElise:\nYes... A friend of mine secretly submitted a story I had written to a publisher. They liked it so much that they asked if it was alright to make it into a book.\nPhoenix:\nWow... It must have been a really great story.\nMaya:\n...Maybe I should try to write a children's book, too. If I do, you can secretly send it to a publisher for me, Nick.\nElise:\nRecently, I've accepted a sort of... apprentice you might say.\nPhoenix:\nAn apprentice?\nElise:\nHe calls himself Laurice... Laurice Deauxnim. I believe he's off doing some landscape sketches now... On Laurice's behalf as well, I'd like to thank you for your support.\nPearl:\nOf course, Ms. Elise! Anything for you!\nElise:\nHa ha ha...\n\n\n\n\nWhy come here?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPearl:\nUm... Why did you come to Hazakura Temple, Ms. Elise? Are you here... to do some spiritual training?\nElise:\nHa ha ha... No, that's not it. I'm actually here to gather materials for a new book I'm working on.\nPearl:\nWow! I-I can't wait to read it!\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls is completely taken with her...)\nElise:\nI wanted to do a book with a more Japanese feel to it this time.\nPhoenix:\n...So is that why you're dressed like you are?\nElise:\nThe children have a certain image of me in their minds. I don't want to disappoint them...\nPhoenix:\n(What can I say... She's really a sweet lady...)\nPearl:\nWow, Ms. Elise, you're dressed up like a mountain nun!\nElise:\nYes. The good people here were kind enough to let me borrow this... I'm wearing training clothes underneath my robe, as well.\nMaya:\n...I want a staff like that.\nElise:\nYou like the crystal sphere? It's real amethyst, you know.\nMaya:\nMaybe we'll find one like that up here on this mountain. Good luck, Nick! I know you'll find me one!Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMs. Deauxnim? What do you think about this?\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Do you think Ms. Elise is a suspect?\nPhoenix:\nHuh...?\nPearl:\nYou may be Mystic Maya's special someone, but I won't let you do this to Ms. Elise!\nPhoenix:\n(A suspect? Why would I suspect her of anything? It's not like anything's happened.)\nMaya:\nIsn't it cute, Nick? Pearly's getting all overprotective of her new friend.After clearing all Talk options:Elise:\nWell, you'll have to excuse me now... I have to go help with the dinner preparations.Pearl:\nWow! You mean you're cooking dinner tonight?Elise:\nThat's right. Would you like to help too, Pearl?Pearl:\nYes, yes! I want to help with whatever I can!Phoenix:\n(Pearls looks like she just won the lottery...)Maya:\nOh, I'll help too, then...Elise:\n...No, it's fine. Please don't worry about it. Feel free to relax and explore the area with your friend.Maya:\nHuh!? But...Elise:\n...Oh, yes! Please take this. I think it will be of help to you. It's a map of the area. We wouldn't want you to get lost now, would we?Phoenix:\n(The \"Inner Temple\"... There it is, on the other side of the bridge...) Well, if you insist, I guess we'll take this chance to go check out the other temple.Hazakura Temple Map added to the Court Record.Pearl:\nOK! I'll see you two later then! Remember! You're not allowed to fight!Maya:\nCome on, Nick! Let's go! At least we'll stay warm if we keep moving!February 7Hazakura TempleMain GateMaya:\nHuh? Where did Sister Bikini go?Phoenix:\nI guess she went to the Inner Temple... To go help that other nun out.Maya:\nOh, right... I think her name is... Iris?Phoenix:\nY-Yeah... That was it. (I want to find out who Iris really is, but I'm scared of what I'll find...)Maya:\n...?February 7Inner Temple GateMaya:\nWhoa, that bridge was shaking like jello in an earthquake.Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nAnd at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I bet. (Changed from [And at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I'd bet.] in the original release)Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nNot to mention the last part only had like one board left on it!Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nWhat's wrong with you? Your face is all green.Phoenix:\nC-Can you not pick on me for a second? I'm still trying to get over the shock that we made it safely across that death trap.Maya:\nYeah, I guess I'm a bit surprised, too... Yikes! That \"temple\" is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse at any time... (Changed from [Yikes! That 'temple' is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse anytime...] in the original release)Phoenix:\nI guess people don't use it too often. Is this really where you're going to train tonight?Maya:\nThat has to be it. It's kinda creepy around here... Like a ghost might jump out at you or something!Phoenix:\n(A spirit medium afraid of ghosts...? Isn't it ironic, don't you think?)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI don't care how much you pay me, I don't want to cross that bridge again.\nMaya:\nNo worries, Nick. No one is offering you any money.\nPhoenix:\nThat's because no reasonable person would call that pile of popsicle sticks a bridge! The latter half of it was nothing more than a few planks of wood and some string!\nMaya:\nHey, if we want to get back, we've got no choice but to cross it again, you know.\nPhoenix:\n... Maybe I'll just stay... I've always dreamed of living in a little shack in the woods.\nMaya:\n...Wow, you really are scared, aren't you?\n\n\n\n\nSuspension wire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nIt looks like this bridge is suspended by 4 of these wires.\nPhoenix:\n...They're reeeally thin. Shouldn't they be just a little thicker...?\nMaya:\nOh, stop it! You're such a worrywart, Nick! If the bridge were really going to collapse... ...I'm pretty sure the boards would break before these wires ever did!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nWhat's wrong? You're turning into an over-ripe avocado again.\n\n\n\n\nBuddha statues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nOh, wow! Look at these neat Buddha statues. Maybe I'll take one home with me.\nPhoenix:\nMaya!\nMaya:\nBut there are so many. They wouldn't notice if I took just one.\nPhoenix:\nAre you kidding? Of course they'll notice! What are you gonna do with one of those anyway?\nMaya:\nPut it in the office of course! We can trade that wooden statue in the office reception area for one of these!\nPhoenix:\n(You know, come to think of it, where did that wooden statue come from anyway...?)\n\n\n\n\nIncinerator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nHey! There's a giant robot buried in the snow!\nPhoenix:\n... Well, there's something buried in the snow, but... I think it's an incinerator.\nMaya:\nOh... Hee hee. But you've gotta admit it looks a lot like a robot.\nPhoenix:\nUm, sure... Anyway, I don't think it gets used much. It's looking pretty rusty.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Do you think this Giant Robo-cinerator can walk?\nPhoenix:\nI told you! It's not a robot! ...And it's not especially big either.\nMaya:\nBah, you have no imagination. I thought it'd be real neat if you had to beat it to advance.\nPhoenix:\n(A fight between a lawyer and an overgrown furnace? Who'd ever pay to see that!?)\n\n\n\n\nYellow gate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nHey! A half-opened gate! That's practically a welcome mat!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, except the sign on here says, \"No Entry\".\nMaya:\nUmm, Nick. Rules are made to be broken, you know.\nPhoenix:\n...You expect a lawyer to go along with that?\nMaya:\nOh, come on! You're such an old lady sometimes! Let's just go!\nPhoenix:\nDon't blame it on me when Sister Bikini puts a curse on you.\nMaya:\n... Now you've got me scared. Um, let's just forget about it, OK?\n\n\n\n\nWooden log on left\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nLooks like there's something written on it.\nPhoenix:\nI can't read it, but if I had to take a good guess, I'd say it says, \"Inner Temple\".\nMaya:\nWhat's the point of a sign if you can't read it? Must be tough for the mailman when he's delivering here.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess the sign is a good indication of how long this place has been here...)\n\n\n\n\nGate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nSo that's the Inner Temple up ahead, huh?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks kinda run-down.\nMaya:\nWell, it wouldn't be very temple-like if it was all bright and shiny.\nPhoenix:\nSo you're training here tonight, huh?\nMaya:\nYup! Then everyone'll see my spiritual powers!\n...Uuurrrgh...ggnngh...ggh...\nPhoenix:\nSounds like your stomach wants to show off its digestive powers instead...\nMaya:\nI wonder if that roast is ready yet?February 7Inner TempleTraining HallPhoenix:\nMan, look at this place... It's just a tiny, freezing-cold room. So this is where you'll both be training, huh...Maya:\nHuh? What do you mean, \"both\"? I'm the only one.Phoenix:\nReally? But I thought...Maya:\nPearly's just a little kid. She couldn't handle this kind of intense training.Phoenix:\n(So says the girl who I can barely hear over her teeth chattering...) (Changed from [So says the girl who I can barely hear over her bones chattering...] in the original release)Maya:\nAnyway... The real training room must be behind that door over there. Hmm... Yup, definitely getting the feeling it's back there. (Changed from [Yeah, I get the feeling it's back there, definitely.] in the original release)Phoenix:\n(Even I can sense that there's something supernatural about the cavern behind that door...) (Changed from [If only because the cavern behind that door is giving off a real supernatural feel...] in the original release)???:\nUm... Excuse me, but... Who are you...? ...Ah! ...Phoenix:\nY-You're...Maya:\nHi there! We're just looking around since we're going to be staying here tonight...???:\n...Maya:\n...? Is something wrong????:\nUh, er, no! It-It's nothing...Maya:\nI wonder why she spaced out like that. Don't you, Nick?Phoenix:\nUh... D-Did you say something, M-Maya?Maya:\n... Not you too, Nick...Iris:\nI... M-My name is Iris. I'm one of the nuns here at this temple.Maya:\nI'm Maya Fey. It's a pleasure to meet you!Iris:\nThe pleasure is mine... ... Oh, er, please excuse me! I have some... um, chores to attend to.Maya:\nShe sure is beautiful... and a bit spacey, I guess... I guess she's just not used to talking with urban sophisticates like us.Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nNick?Phoenix:\n(That girl... It-It can't be, but...)Maya:\n...?Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDresser drawers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nLook at this antique dresser. I wonder if there's anything valuable inside. Let's have a look... Hmph... Nothing! Just a bunch of clothes. Hey, Nick.\nPhoenix:\n... Huh! Oh, sorry. I was just... thinking.\nMaya:\nOh? About Iris, I bet! Looks like you've been bitten by the love bug, Nick!\n\n\n\n\nMattresses\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere are a bunch of musty looking blankets and bedding sets piled up here. I wonder why they're even here in the first place? \nMaya:\nIt's because all spiritual training is done under the supervision of a nun. I wonder if Sister Bikini is planning to sleep in here while I train? \nPhoenix:\n(But if they sleep, what's the point of having them here in the first place...?)\n\n\n\n\nSacred cavern entrance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nThe actual training area must be on the other side of this door. I wonder what it's like. Phooey... It's locked. Come on, Nick! You know you want to open it for me!\nPhoenix:\n...I can't.\nMaya:\n... You've been in kind of a bad mood lately, haven't you, Nick? ...Zvarri! I know what it is! I-R-I-S.\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nHa ha ha ha ha! ♪Iris and Nick, sitting in a tree!

Why did you scream like that!?\nMaya:\nTh-This scroll...! It-It's my mother...\nPhoenix:\nWh... Whaaaaaaaat!?\nMaya:\n...It's Misty Fey. The Master of the Kurain School of Channeling...\nPhoenix:\nAre... Are you sure?\nMaya:\nYes... The crest at the top of the scroll... That's the special mark of the Master of our tradition.\nPhoenix:\n(So that's what the mark means...)\nMaya:\n...\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it?\nMaya:\nN-Nothing... It's just that... I last saw her over 15 years ago... If it wasn't for that crest... I wouldn't have even known it was her. My own mother... And I can't even recognize her face.\nPhoenix:\nMaya...\nHanging Scroll added to the Court Record.\n\n\n\n\nHanging scroll (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's a hanging wall scroll showing Maya's mother, Misty Fey. It's not that old. That crest at the top is the official mark of the Master. I wonder if this temple has some sort of connection to \nthe Fey family...\nMaya:\nI think it does, actually. Supposedly, it was founded by a branch family member of the Kurain School.\nPhoenix:\n(I'll have to ask Bikini in more detail when I get the chance... About Maya... And the Fey family in general.)After examining hanging scroll in Inner Temple - Training Hall:February 7Dusky BridgeMaya:\nWhew, we managed to make it across Dusty Bridge.Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nNick, you look green.

Sorry...???:\nHey, you! ...Wait up!Maya:\n...? You think he's yelling at us?Phoenix:\nHe must be. There's no one else around...???:\nWould you mind moving? You're standing right in my way. ...

I just... I wanted to start over again! With a clean slate!\nMaya:\nA clean slate...?\nButz:\nYou remember don't you? Last time?\nPhoenix:\n(The Mask☆DeMasque case...)\nButz:\nAfter that, I started to realize I didn't like this guy known as Larry Butz! And that's when I came across it... The book of destiny!\nMaya:\nThe \"book of destiny\"...? Do you mean...?\nButz:\n\"The Magic Bottle\"! By Ms. Elise Deauxnim! It's so beautiful... So moving... So... So gentle. My heart felt cleansed! I-I was saved!\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe I should buy a copy of \"The Magic Bottle\"...)\nMaya:\nWow, Larry would make a great book salesman! I really want to get that book now, too!\n\n\n\n\nElise Deauxnim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nShe's the most wonderful person I've ever met!

That's a beautiful photo!\n\n\n\n\nPicture books\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nStill, it's kinda hard to imagine you as a picture book illustrator... So tell the truth. You must have some kind of ulterior motive, right?\nButz:\nWh-What're you talking about!? I don't... I don't trust anyone anymore... Especially not women!\nMaya:\n...Talk about a bad case of denial.\nPhoenix:\nAnyway... Can you even draw well enough to make a picture book?\nButz:\nArt isn't only about technical skill, you know. It's also about having a pure heart!\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's why I'm asking. Can you draw well enough to make a whole book?\nButz:\n...! Hmm... Now that you mention it... I wonder.\nMaya:\nIt looks like you still have some doubt in your heart.\nButz:\nIt's true, I do... But when I first saw her, I felt it! Something inside me ended, and something else began.\nMaya:\nOh Larry, it sounds like you've fallen in love with Ms. Elise Deauxnim!\nButz:\nNo! Y-You're wrong! It's not her...

Yeah, that's right. Of course I have! I have... basically. But...\nMaya:\n\"But\"...?\nButz:\nBut... Iris is different. I feel like...

So, for example, how do you read this?Elise:\nIt says, \"gravely\"... That's kind of a tough word.Pearl:\nOh! OK! And what about this word?Elise:\nThat's another tough one. It says, \"roast\".Phoenix:\n(What kind of a book is she reading anyway...?)Pearl:\nWell, I'm going to go wash the dishes and help clean up. I'll go visit you when I'm done, Ms. Elise!Phoenix:\n(Well, not much to do except head to my room and huddle under the covers, I guess...)February 7, 9:12 PMHazakura TempleMain HallPhoenix:\n(Ugh...

Ah, Ms. Deauxnim! Are you going to use the bathroom, too?Elise:\nUm, no. But... Have you seen Pearl?Phoenix:\nNo... Not since after dinner.

You're Sister Iris, right?\nIris:\n...Yes.\nPhoenix:\nS-So... um, when did you come to Hazakura Temple?\nIris:\n... I don't remember. Ever since I was a small child, the temple has been my home.\nPhoenix:\nSo you've never left?\nIris:\nWell, I don't have any family left to take care of me... Sister Bikini... I've come to think of her as my real mother, as it were.\nPhoenix:\nAh, I see... But you... Didn't you go to college? ...And maybe enroll with the Ivy University Literature Department?\nIris:\nNo, I never had an interest in going to a big university like that... My training is all the education I need.\nPhoenix:\nI... I see...\nIris:\nBut... Once in a while, when I get the chance, I make a trip to the nearby town. I can use a computer and a cell phone, too.\nPhoenix:\n... (That's not exactly something worth bragging about...

I heard it's for training to increase your spiritual power or something like that.\nIris:\nIt must seem awfully crazy to normal people like you.\nPhoenix:\nWell, I have to admit it is a whole different world up here...\nIris:\nI'm glad to hear you say that.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nIris:\nTalking with dead people... Who does it help anyway? ...I hate it.\nPhoenix:\nR-Really?

I would like you to have this.Phoenix:\nBut this is your hood...Iris:\nIt has the power to protect you from evil spirits.Phoenix:\n(Come to think of it, Sister Bikini was wearing one of these, too...)Iris:\nI pray for your safety on this dark, cold night.Iris's Hood received from Iris.Iris:\nI'm sorry, but I must bid you goodnight.Phoenix:\nWait a minute, Sister Iris...Iris:\nY-Yes...?Phoenix:\nJust now, you called me by my name...

He took a really nasty spill!Edgeworth:\nWell, it wouldn't be the first time, so...Butz:\nI'm not joking! His life is in danger!Edgeworth:\nWh-What...!? What happened!? Tell me!Butz:\nTalk about a guy with bad luck! He may already be dead! Anyway, you've got to come back! You're the only one that can help! My Iris... My beautiful Iris! She needs help...!Edgeworth:\nAlright. I don't know what's going on, but... I'll be there as soon as I can.Butz:\nI-I'm at the detention center! Please! Hurryyyyyy!Phone:\n...*beep*...Edgeworth:\n(It's been one year since I left that country... I thought I wouldn't have to see him again for a while... Sounds like it won't be a pretty reunion... As if I expected anything to change.)February 8, 2:19 PMDetention CenterVisitor's RoomButz:\nYou're late, Edgey! What took you so long!?Edgeworth:\nI don't want to hear it! I chartered a private jet to come as quickly as I could!Butz:\nWell, you should've chartered a faster one! Anyway, just listen! Something happened to Ms. Elise... and Nick is... Maya... and Iris's Bikini... ...Huh? Say something, Edgey!Edgeworth:\n...Before I came here, I stopped in at the hospital where Wright is. I believe I have a better understanding of the situation than you, at this point. The murder victim was the picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. She was found by Wright and the head nun. The suspect is the temple's younger nun. Then later, while Wright was crossing the bridge, it broke and he fell into the river. The hospital says that he'll need at least 2 days of bed rest.Butz:\nY-Yes! Th-That's right! You got it! B-But they arrested her... My sweet little Iris!Edgeworth:\n(And here I was, convinced HE was the one the police had arrested...) However... I still don't understand what these two items are for.Butz:\nWhat are you talking about?Edgeworth:\nThey're things Wright gave to me when I was leaving his room. (This is the first... He said some nonsense about being able to see into people's hearts with this... And the other... He couldn't possibly be asking what I think he is... could he?)Butz:\nI'm begging you! Iris's trial starts tomorrow! With Nick out of the picture, you're all I've got left! You're the only one that can represent her!Edgeworth:\n... What did you just say?Butz:\nYou know! REPRESENT! DEFEND! What were you expecting!? Why do you think I called you anyway!?Edgeworth:\n...I'm a prosecutor, Larry. A prosecutor. Do YOU understand what I'm saying? A prosecutor is a lawyer who...Butz:\nDon't talk to me like a kid! I graduated from junior high, you know! Don't worry about it! I promise I won't tell!Edgeworth:\nBut I...Butz:\nI mean, I heard a paper badge had no problem fooling an entire court before!Edgeworth:\n(...How could this country's judicial system have fallen into such decay!?)Butz:\nPlease, Edgey! At least listen to her... Listen to Iris's side of the story!Edgeworth:\n(So Wright wasn't joking when he gave me this badge after all...)Iris:\nThank you for coming. ...My name is Iris.Edgeworth:\n...Edgeworth. Miles Edgeworth. I don't know if I can be of any help, but... ...I will at least hear what you have to say. ...About the murder.Iris:\nUm...Edgeworth:\n...?Iris:\nM-Mr. Wright! H-H-How is he? Mr. Laurice said that he... That he might even die...Edgeworth:\n... Fortunately, he will be fine. (Larry, you moron! How could you say something like that!?) He was badly bruised when he hit the water, but otherwise he is unharmed.Iris:\n... Thank goodness...Edgeworth:\nBut, he's caught some kind of nasty cold.Iris:\nA cold...?Edgeworth:\nHe's running a high fever and is drifting in and out of consciousness.Iris:\n...Edgeworth:\n(I must be imagining things. This woman... I feel like I've met her before...)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurveillance camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe camera is glaring at me. \"If something glares at you, it's only polite to return the favor,\" is what I was taught. ...\nIris:\nUm... Is something bothering you?\nEdgeworth:\n...Hm? Oh, e-excuse me.\n\n\n\n\nGuard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe guard is glaring at me. \"If something glares at you, it's only polite to return the favor,\" is what I was taught. ...\nIris:\nUm... Are you alright, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n...Hm? Oh, e-excuse me.Move\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Going to a crime scene is akin to entering a jungle teeming with dangerous beasts. Before he goes there, a hunter needs to make sure he has plenty of ammunition. And in my case, that \nammunition is called, \"information\".Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nPardon me... Iris. I would like to ask you something, if you don't mind. I have the distinct feeling you and I have met before...\nIris:\nI-It must be your imagination, Mr. Edgeworth. After all... I hardly ever leave Hazakura Temple.\nEdgeworth:\nHazakura Temple? What's that?\nIris:\nIt's a place where those who wish to boost their spiritual power come to train. You need to undergo some very difficult training to release your inner spiritual power.\nEdgeworth:\nSpiritual power...? Did you go to that temple for that reason as well?\nIris:\nNo... I don't have any spiritual powers. I don't need them.\nEdgeworth:\nIn that case, what are you doing at that temple then?\nIris:\n... I... I've committed some sins. Sins that I need to pay for. That's why I'm there, and why I continue to train... To purify my soul.\n\n\n\n\nThe night of the crime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI want to ask you about last night... The night of the crime.\nIris:\nAlright... I helped to clean up after dinner, and then went back to my room at about 8:00. Later, I left my room to ring the lights out bell at 10:00.\nEdgeworth:\nBell...?\nIris:\n...We ring it at the same time each night.\nEdgeworth:\nI see... And then?\nIris:\nA-And then...\nEdgeworth:\n...?\nIris:\nI was told to go to the Training Hall, but... I went back to my room... and stayed there...\nEdgeworth:\nWhy didn't you go to the Training Hall like you were asked to?\nIris:\n...I-I was frightened.\nEdgeworth:\n(\"Frightened\"...?)\nIris:\nSo I just stayed in my room and meditated... until the murder happened.\nEdgeworth:\n(There's more to her story.  I just know there is. Maybe  I should dig a little deeper.)\n\n\n\n\nFrightened? (appears after \"The night of the crime\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou were asked to go to the Training Hall on the night of the murder?\nIris:\nYes...\nEdgeworth:\nHowever... You didn't go. Because you say you were frightened. What exactly were you so frightened of?\nIris:\n...!\n\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Wh-What in the world!?)\nIris:\nUm... Is there something wrong?\nEdgeworth:\n...I'm sorry. It's nothing. (It looks like she's not aware of them herself... These must be what Wright was talking about... The \"Psycholocks\"! I believe he said that I need to present this \"Magatama\" item to do something...)\nIris:\n...?\n\n\n\n\nFrightened? (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nI... I don't like to walk alone at night. And, last night was...\nEdgeworth:\nWhat about last night?\n\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n\nIris:\nEr, oh... nothing. It's rather silly...\nEdgeworth:\nSo there was something special about last night, hmm?\nIris:\nNngh...\nEdgeworth:\n(It looks like I have no choice but to break these locks...)\n\n\n\n\nAny idea? (before clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night?\nIris:\n...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed.\nEdgeworth:\nSpiritual power...?\nIris:\nYes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example...\nEdgeworth:\n...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science. I don't believe in \"spiritual power\".\nIris:\nYes... I understand. Most people don't.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd I am certain that the thing that killed the victim was a human. So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim?\nIris:\n... No. I'm not the one who took her life.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... (That was foolish of me... It's not as if I can know for certain if she is telling me the truth...)\n\n\n\n\nAny idea? (after clearing \"Frightened?\" Talk option)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night?\nIris:\n...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed.\nEdgeworth:\nSpiritual power...?\nIris:\nYes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example...\nEdgeworth:\n...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science. I don't believe in \"spiritual power\".\nIris:\nYes... I understand. Most people don't.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd I am certain that the thing that killed the victim was a human. So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim?\nIris:\n... No. I'm not the one who took her life.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... (Those Psycholock things aren't appearing... I suppose that means I can believe that she's not lying.) ...Heh.\nIris:\nWhat's wrong?\nEdgeworth:\n(I can't believe what I'm thinking... And here I just finished saying that I don't believe in spiritual power...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nIs that an attorney's badge?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, this belongs to Wright.\nIris:\nReally?\nEdgeworth:\nI'm actually a prosecutor.\nIris:\nOh...! Then why do you have a defense attorney's badge pinned on your lapel...?\nEdgeworth:\nWell, you see... I, um... I borrowed it.\n\n\n\n\nHanging Scroll\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWho is the woman on this hanging scroll?\nIris:\nWell, I don't know the details, but... I've heard she's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique.\nEdgeworth:\nM-Master?\nIris:\nYes. Mystic Misty. She was a great spirit medium. ...That's what I've heard. I also heard that she went missing over 15 years ago.\nEdgeworth:\n... Spirit mediums... There's no such thing anyway...\nIris:\nMr. Edgeworth...?\nEdgeworth:\nI know all about them... They're nothing but frauds!\nIris:\n...?\nEdgeworth:\n(She doesn't know anything about it, of course... But there was a time, 17 years ago, when I met the \"Master\" myself...)\n\n\n\n\nIris's Hood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nThat's called a \"Demon-Warding Hood\". ...I gave that to Mr. Wright last night.\nEdgeworth:\nHe was wearing this when I saw him at the hospital today.\nIris:\nIt's an important item for protecting acolytes from evil spirits.\nEdgeworth:\nIf it's so important, then why did you give it to him?\nIris:\nLast night... I felt... something... I felt that something terrible was about to happen... I... I didn't want Mr. Wright to fall into its grip.\nEdgeworth:\n(Well he wound up falling into something much deeper and colder... I probably shouldn't say that out loud, though. Thank god for inner monologue.)\n\n\n\n\n\"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\n...I was against the idea of our temple appearing in that magazine. I was afraid that... this type of a tragedy might occur.\nEdgeworth:\nIn that case, why did you allow them to run an article about you?\nIris:\nIt was Sister Bikini... She's actually rather fond of attention... Surprisingly so.\nEdgeworth:\n(She certainly does look rather happy in this photo...)\n\n\n\n\nPhoto of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nThat's Mystic Elise Deauxnim. She's a picture book author, or so I've heard.\nEdgeworth:\nDoes she come to Hazakura Temple often...?\nIris:\nNo... This was her first time. It's just that...\nEdgeworth:\n...?\nIris:\nShe was a very important visitor.\nEdgeworth:\nIs that so?\nIris:\nYes, Sister Bikini told me, \"Be certain not to offend her.\"\nEdgeworth:\n(The victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim... The prosecutor's office still doesn't have much information about her it seems...)\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix Wright profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nMr. Wright... How bad is his cold?\nEdgeworth:\nWell his fever is very high. As a result, he's rather confused. He's worried about Maya, who is still trapped in the Inner Temple... ...And he's quite worried about you as well, it seems.\nIris:\n...Really?\nEdgeworth:\nYes... Naturally, once he recovers, I'll pass the baton back to him.\nIris:\nNo... Don't... I'm sure that Mr. Wright wouldn't want that... He wouldn't want to defend me.\n\n\n\n\nLarry Butz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nOh... That's Mr. Laurice.\nEdgeworth:\n...I'm sorry? Who did you say it was?\nIris:\nLaurice Deauxnim. He is Mystic Elise's apprentice, I think.\nEdgeworth:\n(Alright... Now who exactly is this guy...?)\nIris:\nHe's a very sincere, hard-working person.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nIris:\nUm... Did I say something wrong, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nE-Excuse me. I was temporarily at a loss for words. (Take a trip... Come home... Be thrust suddenly into bizarro world...)\n\n\n\n\nIris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nYou want to know about me? There's not much to tell, I'm afraid.\nEdgeworth:\nJust let me get one thing straight. You were raised at Hazakura Temple, correct? And yet, somehow, you seem to know Wright.\nIris:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nSo you two must have crossed paths somewhere.\nIris:\n...No, Mr. Edgeworth. Whomever it was... ...it couldn't have been me.\nEdgeworth:\n(What is that supposed to mean?)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nI'm sorry... I don't leave the temple grounds very often... So I don't know very much about the outside world.After clearing all Talk options:Edgeworth:\nHmm... It appears that's about all that you can tell me.Iris:\nThank you very much for listening to my story.Edgeworth:\n...I visited Wright at the hospital before coming here. He asked me to take care of you...Iris:\n...M-Me?Edgeworth:\nYes, at the trial tomorrow... He asked me to defend you.Iris:\n... If Mr. Wright has that much faith in you, Mr. Edgeworth... ...Then I will gladly entrust my fate in your capable hands.Edgeworth:\nBut before that, I have one question.Iris:\nYes?Edgeworth:\nDo you know Wright?Iris:\nEr... Wh-Why would you ask that?Edgeworth:\nWhenever you came up in our conversation, he would begin to act a little... strange.Iris:\n... Mr. Edgeworth... What is Mr. Wright to you? (Changed from [Mr. Edgeworth... Are you his friend?] in the original release)Edgeworth:\n...He is a very dear and indispensable friend. (Changed from [Friend? Well... In a sense, yes.] in the original release)Iris:\n... It was 5 years ago... That's when I... That's when I... deceived him.Edgeworth:\nYou \"deceived\" him...?Iris:\nI heard that he was... in a lot of pain after what happened. I know what a weak person I am. That's why... That's why I thought it was best if he never saw me again. I wanted him to just forget about me, without learning the truth.Edgeworth:\n... Well, if you ask me, Wright is still suffering... And until he learns the truth, I don't think he will ever be able to truly recover. ...Iris. It's not too late. You should go to him. ...Tell him the truth.Iris:\n...Edgeworth:\nI'll defend you, but only if you agree to that one condition.Iris:\n... Alright, Mr. Edgeworth... I promise.Edgeworth:\n...Very well. I'll do everything in my power to get you an acquittal. (That's enough information gathering for now. I should head to the crime scene...)February 8Dusky BridgeEdgeworth:\n(It sure is cold alright... So this is it... Dusky Bridge...)???:\nOh, wow! It's you, Mr. Edgeworth! (Changed from [Ahem! M-Mr. Edgeworth!] in the original release)Edgeworth:\nNngh... Detective Gumshoe. (Changed from [Urk... Detective Gumshoe.] in the original release)Gumshoe:\nLong time no see! It's been about a year? ...Or has it been longer?Edgeworth:\nIt doesn't matter, Detective. What does matter is why you're shuffling around up here.Gumshoe:\nOh, ouch! ...And there's that sharp left jab! (Changed from [Oh, ouch! ...And there was a sharp left jab!] in the original release) Well, I'm happy to see you anyway, Mr. Edgeworth!Edgeworth:\nLet me guess... You were transferred by HR to the local precinct? (Changed from [Let me guess... You were transferred into another section at work.] in the original release) A wise decision. The vast amount of nothing up here should be quite easy to guard. (Changed from [A good choice. The vast amount of nothing up here must be quite easy to guard.] in the original release)Gumshoe:\nI heard you were back in the country and arranged to come all the way out here! Everybody was real nice. They even let me take charge of the investigation, sir.Edgeworth:\n(...Gumshoe indeed! Like gum on your shoe, he's impossible to get rid of!)Gumshoe:\nI'm supposed to report on the details of the crime scene, sir! Anyway! Here I am! Detective Dick Gumshoe! Reporting for duty!Edgeworth:\n...Great. Um, thank you, Detective.Gumshoe:\nI thought Prosecutor Godot was gonna get here before me. That guy's a real mystery, I tell you!Edgeworth:\n(...Prosecutor Godot?)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCliff on other side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt looks like a pretty good distance to that far cliff.\nGumshoe:\nYeah... It's gotta be around 100 yards or so.\nEdgeworth:\n... Detective... That's not even CLOSE to a hundred yards.\nGumshoe:\nWell... I gotta admit I'm not very good at judging distances.\nEdgeworth:\n(It's about 20 yards or so. And impossible to cross without a bridge, it seems...)\n\n\n\n\nWooden sign on left side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThere's a little shack down that way called, \"Heavenly Hall\".\nEdgeworth:\nA shack...?\nGumshoe:\nIt's like a run-down doghouse for losers that can't bear the freezing drafts of wind... Kinda reminds me of my apartment, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nThe name \"Heavenly Hall\" makes it sound like a palace...\nGumshoe:\nGiving a hovel a great name is a crime itself! I'd call it false advertising! By the way, the name of my apartment complex is \"Compton Castles\"...\nEdgeworth:\n...That's not such a great name, if you ask me.\nGumshoe:\nWell, it's not such a great apartment either, sir.\n\n\n\n\nBridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo this is the bridge Wright tried to cross?\nGumshoe:\nPretty reckless, if you ask me.\nEdgeworth:\nI'm amazed he survived the fall from up here...\nGumshoe:\nYeah, he's one lucky guy, sir. Now I see how he manages to win his cases in court. Blind luck.\nEdgeworth:\n(I think dumb luck suits Wright just a bit better.)\n\n\n\n\nBoulder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSome letters are wildly engraved into a roughly cut boulder. \"Dusky Bridge\"... It certainly is an appropriate name.\nGumshoe:\nYou need to get some glasses, Mr. Edgeworth! That sign says, \"Dusty Bridge\". I can see how you read it wrong, though, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nYou're the one who needs glasses, Detective. Try reading it one more time.\nGumshoe:\n... Ah! You're right! It's \"Dusky Bridge\" after all! ... I guess whoever wrote this made a mistake!\n\n\n\n\nPublic phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nHey! It's a public phone! You don't see a lot of these anymore!\nEdgeworth:\n...That's true.\nGumshoe:\nSince we've got one here, why don't we take a photo as a memento!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, um, sure. Why not?\nGumshoe:\nOh, darn it! I don't have a camera with me! ...I'm gonna go buy a disposable camera! I'll be right back, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n(What's so special about public phones, and why is he so fascinated by them...?)Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened (before visitng Main Hall)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case...\nGumshoe:\nIt's simple!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, simple is as simple does, as they say.\nGumshoe:\nOh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing!\nEdgeworth:\nA witness...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that Bikini lady.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Bikini lady\"? Here? On this freezing cold mountain?\nGumshoe:\n...Well, you should talk to her yourself if you want the details, sir.\nEdgeworth:\n(I may have to talk to this \"bikini lady\"... I mean, \"decisive witness\" myself...)\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened (after visitng Main Hall)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case...\nGumshoe:\nIt's simple!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, simple is as simple does, as they say.\nGumshoe:\nOh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing!\nEdgeworth:\nA witness...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that Bikini lady.\n\n\n\n\nDusky Bridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo this is the bridge that Wright fell through?\nGumshoe:\nYup! I can't imagine being that reckless myself... \"Look before you cross,\" is how it goes, right? Or was that \"leap\"...?\nEdgeworth:\nAnd? Is there something on the other side?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, some old building they call the Inner Temple... But we can't get over there without a bridge, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat...?\nGumshoe:\nNobody lives there, so it's usually not a problem... But someone was at the Inner Temple doing some training and now they're stuck there.\nEdgeworth:\nYes, I heard that from Wright. It's Maya Fey.\nGumshoe:\nOh no... Her again...? Anyway, the air's really turbulent right now so we can't do an aerial extraction. No one's gonna be able to reach the Inner Temple until tomorrow, sir.\nEdgeworth:\n(Will she be alright in this cold...?) So how did this bridge burn down anyway?\nGumshoe:\nWe're almost 100% sure it was lightning.\nEdgeworth:\n...Lightning?\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor Godot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo who is this Prosecutor Godot? I've never heard of him.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, he's a new guy... Showed up after you left the country! He's a complete rookie, but nobody can say a bad word about the guy.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat kind of a man is he?\nGumshoe:\nHe just became a prosecutor recently, but he's good, sir. Real good.\nEdgeworth:\n(If he's so good, how is it that I've never heard of him...?) Is he the lead prosecutor on this case?\nGumshoe:\nYou bet he is! After all, \"you know who\" is right in the middle of it.\nEdgeworth:\n\"You know who\"?\nGumshoe:\nPhoenix Wright, of course! For some reason, Godot has really got it in for Mr. Wright!\nEdgeworth:\nOh?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, he seems to have some kind of a grudge.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd what would be the cause of this grudge...?\nGumshoe:\nI dunno... Maybe he made fun of his mask or something.\nEdgeworth:\n(None of this is making any sense. I'd better look into this Godot myself.)\n\n\n\n\nLightning (appears after \"Dusky Bridge\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning?\nGumshoe:\nYup. Last night it snowed for the first time in 3 days. It's a little unusual for lightning to occur during a snow fall like that... But according to the weather data, lightning definitely struck.\nWeather Data added to the Court Record.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm, I see... This is a very detailed weather report... Almost too detailed... It even has the exact time that the lightning struck the bridge...\nGumshoe:\nOh, that? We got that information from the witness's testimony.\nEdgeworth:\nSomeone actually saw the lightning hit the bridge? Who is this witness?\nGumshoe:\n... Sorry. I'll go ask one of the local cops later, sir.\n\n\n\n\nLightning (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning?\nGumshoe:\nYup.

What's that thing doing on your lapel, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n...Is it really that odd?\nGumshoe:\nYou bet it is, sir! A prosecutor wearing a defense attorney's badge? That's like a detective with a license to kill!\nEdgeworth:\n(Does this little thing hold that ominous of a meaning...?)\n\n\n\n\nMagatama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHave you ever seen this thing before...?\nGumshoe:\nHey, thanks a lot. I was getting kind of hungry! ...*chomp!*\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What are you doing, Detective!?\nGumshoe:\nAck! ...I thought it was some kind of candy that would fill me up, sir. Lately I've been feeling so hungry all the time...\nEdgeworth:\n(Nngh... Maybe his salary has been cut just a little too much...?)\n\n\n\n\nPhoto of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThere's a lot we don't know about this victim... We don't know her real name, her background... We don't know anything really.\nEdgeworth:\nThat's rather odd... If she was trying to hide her identity, why would she become an author?\nGumshoe:\nI'll bet it was just one of those things. You know... She probably never expected to get so popular.\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix Wright profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nWhenever something happens, this guy always shows up like he hasn't got a care. In fact, you know what...? Every time he shows up, I always wonder the same thing. \"Maybe somehow he's actually the cause of all these incidents!\"\nEdgeworth:\n(I wonder if Gumshoe has realized it yet... But you could say the exact the same thing about him!)\n\n\n\n\nDick Gumshoe profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYour face is more drawn out than the last time I saw you over a year ago.\nGumshoe:\nR-Really? I thought so!\nEdgeworth:\nNo, wait... It's not so much \"drawn out\", as \"weary and tired\", or maybe just plain old \"thin\".\nGumshoe:\nI thought that too, sir. My salary's been kinda on the low end... So yeah, my food options have been kinda non-existent. Off-brand chicken soup, off-brand spaghetti, off-brand bread... That sort of stuff.\nEdgeworth:\nI thought you were really into instant noodles last year...?\nGumshoe:\n...I got really sick of the stuff after a while, sir.\n\n\n\n\nLarry Butz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nHe's supposed to be Ms. Elise Deauxnim's apprentice or something.\nEdgeworth:\n...I see.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, he drew a nice portrait of me.\nEdgeworth:\n...That's nice.\nGumshoe:\nBut he made me pay him 50 cents for it.\nEdgeworth:\n...I'm sorry about that.\nGumshoe:\n... You don't seem very interested in him, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\n...I really don't want to talk about him. That's why.\n\n\n\n\nIris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI feel like I've seen this girl somewhere before! She wasn't from a prior case, was she?\nGumshoe:\nNope, can't be. We did a database search with her fingerprints and came up with nothing.\nEdgeworth:\nI see... (I just can't shake this nagging feeling...)\nGumshoe:\nWell, everyone knows that you are quite popular with the ladies, sir... Maybe she's an old girlfriend that you sent to Dumpsville when you were younger.\nEdgeworth:\nD-Detective! Where did you hear such nonsense from!?\nGumshoe:\nI didn't hear it from anyone. It's just sorta how I imagine you to be... sir.\nEdgeworth:\n(...D-Do I really inspire this sort of frothing desire from the female masses?)\n\n\n\n\nGodot profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI usually hear about promising young prosecutor candidates while they're still in school. But I've never seen or heard of this person.\nGumshoe:\nI gotta admit... He's puzzling alright. He just appeared one day, big mug of steaming coffee in his hand...\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... He sounds like an interesting man...\nGumshoe:\nYeah... The whole prosecutor's office is really into double espresso macchiatos lately.\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nLook, I'm just your everyday, simple detective. Don't ask me such tough questions, OK?\nEdgeworth:\n...That's not something to be proud of, Detective!February 8Detention CenterVisitor's RoomEdgeworth:\n(It looks like Iris is being interrogated right now.) ...This place certainly brings back memories.Gumshoe:\nOh yeah. Come to think of it, you got thrown in here once too, didn't you, sir? But you know what? I've never been in jail a single time!Edgeworth:\n(I should think it's hard to land in jail when you're so harmless...) Yes, well... If you're in jail, you don't have to pay for your own meals, you know.Gumshoe:\n...*gasp!* ...Edgeworth:\nDon't get any funny ideas, Detective...!Gumshoe:\n...Too late, I already did.Edgeworth:\n(In any case...

There's something I've always wondered about...\nEdgeworth:\n(Something tells me he's going to tell me what's on his mind, whether I like it or not...)\nGumshoe:\nWe call a person who tells a lie a \"liar\", right? So why don't we call a person who rings a bell a \"beller\"? Or \"truer\" for a guy who tells the truth!

I should never have come back.\nButz:\nNo, no! Don't worry! I see things for how they really are this time!

After all, I saved his life.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is that supposed to mean?\nButz:\nIf I hadn't called for help so quickly, he would have died. It's no surprise though. I used to be a security guard. It was all instinct, baby!\nEdgeworth:\n(He has a point... He called me pretty quickly, too... I think Larry's pretty good at motivating people.

If you ask nicely, I might give you a peek, big boy. Wa ha ha ho ho ho!Gumshoe:\nUmm... Mr. Edgeworth? This is the head nun, Sister Bikini... She's the witness.Edgeworth:\n... Why didn't you tell me that earlier!? This is exactly why your salary keeps on getting cut!Gumshoe:\nNngh... My stomach is already growling in protest...Bikini:\nSo... Um... What's the latest about my beloved Iris!?Edgeworth:\nWell, first... I want to hear what you know.Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWalls or sliding doors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere's flowing script written everywhere on the walls.\nGumshoe:\nMan, I'd bet you'd have awful nightmares if you tried to sleep in here.\nBikini:\nThis is our Main Hall, so it's protected by a variety of magic spells and charms... They're all designed to prevent evil forces from entering.\nGumshoe:\nSo if I slept here the uggie-woogie-boogieman wouldn't hunt me down for eternity? Alright!\nEdgeworth:\n(Does this guy think about anything other than eating and sleeping...?)\n\n\n\n\nObjects on floor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nOh! It's a warmed cat box! But where are all the cats?\nEdgeworth:\n...It's called a \"hibachi\". It's for heating the room.\nGumshoe:\nOh! Look at all these ancient straw frisbees!\nEdgeworth:\nThose are a type of \"zabuton\" cushions called \"enza\"!\nGumshoe:\n... Why are you giving me such a hard time? Huh, Mr. Edgeworth? Why?\nEdgeworth:\nBecause learning something new might actually be a good thing for you, Detective!\n\n\n\n\nAltar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt's an altar with a giant Magatama enshrined on it.\nGumshoe:\nThere are lots of candles lined up on it, too. You know... I haven't had a birthday party for myself in a while...\nEdgeworth:\nMaybe you should blow out those candles over there to make up for that.\nGumshoe:\nMr. Edgeworth? Would you mind singing \"Happy Birthday\" to me?\nBikini:\nS-Stop that! Cut that out! Please don't blow out the altar candles!\n\n\n\n\nMagatama on altar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...That thing sure casts a strong presence over the whole room.\nBikini:\nThis is the \"Lesser Magatama\". It's a precious heirloom containing a great many souls.\nGumshoe:\nHuh...!? This is \"lesser\"!? What is the \"greater\" one like?\nBikini:\nThe \"Greater Magatama\" is displayed in the Main Room of Fey Manor. It was supposed to be shown at the Treasures of Kurain exhibit... But, it was so large that they couldn't bring it through the doors.\n\n\n\n\nLeft corner near altar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(There are more enza cushions in the corner of the room.) ...What's that white piece of paper sticking out from under that stack...?\nGumshoe:\nHmm...

Here you are, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nIt looks like an old manila envelope...\nGumshoe:\nEeeeeeeeeeaaaah!!\nEdgeworth:\n...What is it, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nTh-This... This could be it! An ultra important clue! A super-special clue!\nEdgeworth:\n...I suppose I should read it myself then.\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like a letter addressed to Sister Iris. \"tonight at 10 at Heavenly Hall. ... ...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed.\"\nEdgeworth:\nTh-This sounds like a blackmail letter...!\nNote to Iris added to the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\nNice going there, Mr. Edgeworth! Why can't I ever find clues like that!? You're an ultra-important prosecutor!!

After dinner, the two of us went to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple.\nEdgeworth:\n(She must be talking about Maya...) Approximately what time was that...?\nBikini:\nI suppose it was about 9:00 when we left here. Training lasts all night long. It's extremely exhausting. The channeling dojo's Head Nun must be in attendance at all times to keep watch.\nGumshoe:\nWow, you're right! That does sound exhausting!\nEdgeworth:\nDetective, this is no time for flattery.\nGumshoe:\nSorry.\nEdgeworth:\nSome time around 11:00, you witnessed the incident in the courtyard. But your duty was in the Inner Temple. Why did you come back here?\nBikini:\nHmm... The way you're staring at me, I'm starting to get goosebumps! Ha ha ha ho ho!\nEdgeworth:\n(Nngh... I'm starting to get goosebumps myself, but for a decidedly different reason.)\nGumshoe:\nHo ho, you get the chills pretty easy, don't you Mr. Edgeworth?\n\n\n\n\nWhat you saw\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAlright then... I'd like you to tell me exactly what you saw in the courtyard.\nBikini:\nIt must have been past 11:00. Ah! No! I can't say it! It-It's too much for my poor heart!\nGumshoe:\nHey! Calm down, lady! L-Let go of my tie!\nBikini:\n...I saw two people! One of them was lying on the ground... Th-The other one was stabbing her from the back... with a sword!\nEdgeworth:\nDid you see this criminal with your own eyes?\nBikini:\nI didn't want to believe what I was seeing...! ...But it was Iris!\nEdgeworth:\nYou must have been quite shocked.\nGumshoe:\nOf course she was! Try putting yourself in her shoes! It'd be like if you were stabbing Mr. Wright smack in the middle of a courtroom! And I happened to witness it from the witness stand! ...I'd be pretty shocked too.\nBikini:\nI know it sounds insane... But that's what I saw. And when I finally realized what I was seeing, I screamed, and then... I passed out.\nEdgeworth:\n(...Unfortunately for us, her testimony seems to be pretty solid.)\nBikini:\nHowever... The idea of Iris doing such a foul act seems... unnatural.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Unnatural\"...?\nBikini:\nThe girl I know simply isn't capable of this sort of foulness...\nEdgeworth:\n(...I wonder what she means by that?)\n\n\n\n\nWhy return? (appears after \"The night of the crime\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAs the head nun, it's your duty to stay with the acolyte at all times, correct?\nBikini:\nYes, that's correct. I know I may look strong, but the truth is... I've got a bad lower back.\nEdgeworth:\nA bad lower back...?\nBikini:\nYes, it's especially bad in the winter. So bad that I can't even lift a bucket. Do you remember how cold it was last night? My bad back felt as stiff as frozen glass. I just wanted to take a nice hot bath to ease my aching back... That's why I returned to the Main Hall.\nEdgeworth:\nSo you left the disciple all alone?\nBikini:\nDon't be ridiculous! I would never do that! That's why I ordered Iris to the Inner Temple after she had rung the bell for lights out.\nEdgeworth:\n(Yes, but she never went to the Inner Temple, did she? So did this head nun actually see Iris there? (Changed from [Did this head nun even see Iris?] in the original release) I think I'd better try to get some more details...)\n\n\n\n\nThe acolyte (appears after \"What you saw\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo who is this acolyte that was to train at the Inner Temple...?\nBikini:\nHer name is Maya Fey... I treated her very badly, I'm ashamed to say. And after she went through the trouble of signing up for the Special Course...\nGumshoe:\n\"Special Course\"?\nBikini:\nIt's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant 30,000 times...\nEdgeworth:\nYou don't mean to tell me she's still doing that over at the Inner Temple, do you?\nBikini:\nNo, no, no. Of course not! You don't have to worry about that one little bit. Last night, we still hadn't started the training session itself.\nEdgeworth:\nWell, um... That's good to hear.\nBikini:\n...Oh! Dear, dear! There's one thing I forgot to tell you.\nGumshoe:\n...Uh-oh, I don't think I like the sound of this.\nBikini:\nDo you know that small girl? I believe she is Mystic Maya's little sister.\nEdgeworth:\n(Maya has a little sister...?)\nGumshoe:\nOh, you mean little Pearl! That's Maya Fey's cousin.\nEdgeworth:\nLittle... Pearl...?\nBikini:\nI thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after we'd finished with dinner cleanup... (Changed from [I thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after cleaning up dinner...] in the original release) But I haven't seen her at all since late last night! She's nowhere to be found!\nEdgeworth:\nY-You mean she...!? She was with the victim!?\nBikini:\nIt's all the fault of my stupid, creaky old back!\nEdgeworth:\n(A little girl who was with the victim on the night of the murder... is gone!)\nGumshoe:\nAs they say... \"The plot thickens!\"Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagatama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nTh-That's...!

You don't look it, but now I can see you're a real fan of the occult!\nEdgeworth:\nExcuse me?\nBikini:\nOh, of course this piece couldn't possibly be real, but to have such a nice replica... Clearly, you are a big fan of the Kurain Tradition!\nGumshoe:\nW...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me!\nEdgeworth:\n(I should have known better than to show this thing around...)\n\n\n\n\nHanging Scroll\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nHuh... Ahh! Well, well, well... Look what you've found! That's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, Mystic Misty Fey!\nEdgeworth:\n\"Fey\"...\nBikini:\nIt's been nearly 20 years since Mystic Misty's disappearance. Apparently, she intended to pass on the Master title to her daughter.\nEdgeworth:\nWho is this daughter?\nBikini:\nWell, I myself am part of a branch family of the Fey clan. But even I am not privy to information concerning the main family...\n\n\n\n\nIris's Hood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nWell, well, well! That's a Demon-Warding Hood! Acolytes are highly susceptible to possession by evil spirits, you know. That's why we always wear these for protection.\nEdgeworth:\nOh, I see...\nBikini:\nWhat are you waiting for? You won't get any protection just by holding it, you know! Put it on already!\nEdgeworth:\nNo! I can't...! I was just...!\nBikini:\n... Ha ha ha ho ho ho!\nGumshoe:\nHo ho ho! It's like it was made just for you, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean by that, Detective!?\nBikini:\nIt looks absolutely marvelous!

Absolutely.\nBikini:\nUp until recently, we've avoided exposure in such magazines. But this time we had our reasons...\nEdgeworth:\nIs that so? For exampl--?\nBikini:\nHa ha ha ha ha!!!

You're scary!\nBikini:\nWith that stupid 5 o'clock shadow and that stupid old coat of yours... It's too bad that you weren't the one that disappeared!\nGumshoe:\n... ...Why does she have to take it all out on me?\nEdgeworth:\n(Her anger does seem a little... manufactured.)\n\n\n\n\nNote to Iris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nDo you know anything about this old, crumpled-up letter?\nBikini:\n... Is that addressed to Iris?\nGumshoe:\nYup, it clearly says \"To Iris\" on it.\nBikini:\nI can't believe it... That girl doesn't have any secrets from me...\nEdgeworth:\n(Ah... So Sister Bikini didn't know anything about it...)\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix Wright profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nThis man... His face betrays a life of suffering and great weariness of the world.\nEdgeworth:\n...Um, sure.\nBikini:\nBut even so... I can't believe this guy actually jumped into the river! Think of all the fun things he might have enjoyed if he had just lived... Relentless spiritual training alone is no way to lead a complete life, huh...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n(It sounds like she's got some major regrets she's dealing with... Hmm... Perhaps I should let Gumshoe explain Wright's situation to her for me...)\nGumshoe:\nH-Hey! Don't look at me like that! Do you own dirty work! ...Sir!\n\n\n\n\nLarry Butz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nThis is Mystic Elise's apprentice, is it not? I think he might have a bit of a crush on me... Sweet boy at any rate.\nGumshoe:\nHuh?\nBikini:\nOh, I don't blame him. Sister Bikini understands the temptations of young men.\nEdgeworth:\n...Sure.\nBikini:\nBut I'm afraid it wouldn't be proper to abuse my position. I am head nun, after all. But, in return, I did allow him to draw a portrait of me.\nEdgeworth:\n(I pray it was a pose that maintained your modesty. For everyone's sake...)\n\n\n\n\nIris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou said you went with Maya to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple last night. Did you happen to see Iris while you were there?\nBikini:\nOf course I saw her. I told her to meet us after ringing the 10:00 bell for lights out.\nGumshoe:\nSo you're saying Iris came to the Inner Temple then?\nBikini:\nOf course she did. Iris has always been a good, obedient girl. After that, I had Maya begin her training ceremony.\nEdgeworth:\n(But that doesn't fit with Iris's story at all... She said that she never went to the Inner Temple!)\nGumshoe:\nAs they say... \"The plot thickens!\"\n\n\n\n\nBikini profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nIt's all my fault... Me and my stupid back! Mystic Elise has been murdered, an important acolyte is trapped... ...and a little girl has been lost!\nGumshoe:\nYou know you really shouldn't be so negative. It creates bad karma...\nBikini:\n...Quite right. I need to do some more training myself, I think...\n\n\n\n\nMaya Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nShe's a very important visitor, you know! An honored acolyte!\nEdgeworth:\n\"Honored\"? How so?\nBikini:\nThe Fey name is synonymous with the Kurain Channeling Technique. Therefore, she must be a spirit medium of great power indeed.\nGumshoe:\nNow that you mention it, one year ago... ...there was a case that was about the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique!\nEdgeworth:\n...Detective. I detest talk of supernatural drivel. I suppose now you'll say she has midi-chlorians?\nGumshoe:\nHo ho ho. So it gives you the creeps, huh, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n(...That's got nothing to do with it.)\n\n\n\n\nPearl Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini:\nOh, this poor girl... Where could she have gone...?\nGumshoe:\nWell, we checked out her home and she's not there.\nBikini:\nAnd she's nowhere in the vicinity of the temple either...\nEdgeworth:\n(Which means... ...there's only a few other possibilities as to where she could be.)\nGumshoe:\nAh! Do you think maybe she fell off the bridge and was carried downstream...!?\nEdgeworth:\n... Why do you have to be such a pessimist, Detective!?\nGumshoe:\nNngh... I was just trying to think like you, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\n(Ironic. I became a pessimist only after I had the pleasure of working with you!)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nUmm, about this here...\nBikini:\nHmm... Let me see... Well, as you may know... In order to see reality for what it truly is... ...we strive to break our attachments to much of the transient, material realm. I guess you could call me an \"immaterial girl\"!\nGumshoe:\nI guess she lives in an immaterial world, huh Mr. Edgeworth?Main Gate (before clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nI'm just no good with people like her. She reminds me too much of my mother.\nEdgeworth:\n... May I speak now?\nButz:\nHuh? Sure.\nEdgeworth:\nI don't care how you feel about her personally... ...just tell me what you know about her and how she's related to the case.\nButz:\n... Don't you think you're expecting a little too much of me? I'm just a 25 year old jobless bum trying to be an apprentice artist!

Are you really gonna defend that nun, Iris, at the trial tomorrow?Edgeworth:\nYes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitment. (Changed from [Yes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitments.] in the original release)Gumshoe:\nWell, in that case... I've gotta be careful... Gotta make sure I don't leak the prosecution's whole investigation...Edgeworth:\nDon't worry about it, Detective. Just keep your mouth closed and I think most of it will flow out on its own.Gumshoe:\n... You got it, sir! I'll make sure it flows out like water from a tap! (Changed from [Roger, sir!

You're right! But I'm pretty sure the Main Hall didn't have a 2nd floor.\nEdgeworth:\nHazakura Temple was built on a steep part of the mountain. The front and back of the Main Hall are on different levels.\nGumshoe:\nOh... That makes sense... But wouldn't it be easier just to build the place slanted, sir?\nEdgeworth:\n(I fail to see how he can consider that to be an even remotely good idea.)\n\n\n\n\nSkis, ski poles, or sled\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nAh!

The bruises are consistent with falling from the height of a two-story building.\nEdgeworth:\nA two-story building...? That would be about the same height as that room in front of us, correct?\nGumshoe:\nHey, you're right. Way to go, Mr. Edgeworth!

Let's see if we can summarize what we've learned so far.\nGumshoe:\nOK! Let's take a look at the map. ...According to the testimony of Sister Bikini, the head nun... ...right after they'd finished dinner, she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple. (Changed from [...she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple right after dinner was finished.] in the original release) At 10 PM, after ringing the bell for lights out, Iris went to the Inner Temple. When she got there, Bikini had her take over while she went back to Hazakura Temple. After taking a hot bath to soothe her back... ...Sister Bikini witnessed the murder in the courtyard! If you want more details, you should ask Bikini herself in the Main Hall.\nEdgeworth:\n(The Inner Temple, huh...? I'd like some more information about that place...)\n\n\n\n\nTomorrow's trial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe trial begins tomorrow, but who's the prosecutor?\nGumshoe:\nI'm pretty sure it's that Godot guy, but... ...nobody can get a hold of him, so they're looking for a replacement.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean...?\nGumshoe:\nIt's really weird. All of a sudden, no one can reach him! Hmm, I wonder if the rumors are true. Maybe since Mr. Wright caught a cold and won't be defending, he just lost interest.\nEdgeworth:\nI intend to appear in court in the role of defense lawyer. However... I would be quite unhappy if it came out that I'm actually a prosecutor.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, I can see why. But I'm not the one you have to worry about... I think the real problem is gonna be that judge...\nEdgeworth:\n...Yes, he certainly would remember my face, even after such a long absence. That's why I requested another judge preside over the case. We've only met each other once. There's a good chance he won't remember me at all.\nGumshoe:\nY-Yeah, but... what about the prosecutor? Everyone in the prosecutor's office must know you! Wouldn't it be a problem if someone there made a big stink, sir?\nEdgeworth:\nThere's no need to worry. I pulled a few strings and arranged for a prosecutor of my own choosing.\nGumshoe:\nWow, Mr. Edgeworth... I had no idea you had such a powerful string to pull!\n\n\n\n\nInner Temple (appears after \"What happened\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this Inner Temple that Maya was supposedly training at...?\nGumshoe:\nAccording to Bikini, it's an old building they use for training the acolytes. It's on the other side of Dusky Bridge.\nEdgeworth:\n(The bridge that burned down, huh...) Is there anything else on the other side of that bridge besides the Inner Temple?\nGumshoe:\nNope, not a thing.\nEdgeworth:\nNothing?\nGumshoe:\nThe other side is surrounded by cliffs on all sides... In a way, it's kinda like a little island out there.\nEdgeworth:\n(So the only thing there is the Inner Temple...)\nGumshoe:\nI hear it's not the kind of place a person could survive in.\nEdgeworth:\n(Please be alright, Maya...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictim's Staff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nOh, so I think I might have already told you about this, but... The truth is... When I was a little kid...\nEdgeworth:\nYou wanted to become a wizard, right?\nGumshoe:\nHey, that's amazing! How did you know that!? So? What do you think? I'd make a really great one, don't you think?\nEdgeworth:\nWe just had this conversation a little while ago, Detective!\n\n\n\n\nShichishito\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThis sword represents the multiple branches that life can take, all ending as one.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... I've never heard that one.\nGumshoe:\nYou know what I think about sometimes? What kind of life would I have had if I hadn't joined the Homicide Division.\nEdgeworth:\n...So you think about that kind of thing too, huh?\nGumshoe:\nOf course I do. I think about it a lot. Me as a traffic cop. Me as a detention officer. Me as the Blue Badger...\nEdgeworth:\n(...I guess he doesn't have any plans to leave the force.)\n\n\n\n\nBikini profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThis is the witness who saw the crime take place out there in the temple courtyard. I'm pretty sure it's gonna be her testimony that'll be key to this case, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nSo you mean she's going to be a witness in the trial tomorrow...?\nGumshoe:\nOf course! A nun is as trustworthy as you can get! We got this one in the bag! ... Oh. I-I mean, I've always been on your side, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! So yeah, this is a pretty tight spot we've gotten ourselves into, huh!?\nEdgeworth:\n(Now I understand why Wright is always breaking into a cold sweat...)\n\n\n\n\nMaya Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI wonder if Maya is alright? I could never show my face to Wright again if something were to happen to her.\nGumshoe:\nAww, it'll be OK. If that ever happens, you can just show him my face. How's that...?\nEdgeworth:\n...\nGumshoe:\nAck! Um, I didn't mean it like that, sir! It was just a silly little joke!\nEdgeworth:\nI wonder if there is another way to get across to the other side? The support wires for the bridge are still intact, correct?\nGumshoe:\nThat bridge is almost 20 yards long... I know I may look like it, Mr. Edgeworth, but I'm no super hero.\nEdgeworth:\n(In any case, I just hope Maya is alright...)\n\n\n\n\nPearl Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat about Pearl...? Has no one seen her at all since last night?\nGumshoe:\nSeems that way... Apparently, she hasn't gone back to Kurain Village either, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nBut it's true that she was with Elise Deauxnim at some point last night?\nGumshoe:\nNo doubt about it. Ah...! Y-You mean that maybe whoever killed Ms. Deauxnim also...!?\nEdgeworth:\nD-Don't jump to any crazy conclusions!\nGumshoe:\nOooooouuuch! ...You sure have one mean punch, Mr. Edgeworth! It's down-right fierce!After clearing all Talk options in Dusky Bridge, clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate, clearing all Talk options and examining left corner near altar in Hazakura Temple - Main Hall, and clearing all Talk options and examining staff and Ami Fey statue in Hazakura Temple - Courtyard:February 8Detention CenterVisitor's RoomIris:\nAh...

Where is it on this map...?\nIris:\n...It's around here. To get there, you must follow a small path down from Dusky Bridge...

That's why I'm committed to searching until I have those answers. Now then, is it really true that you didn't go to the Inner Temple last night...?\nIris:\nY-Yes, I swear... I already told you that.\nEdgeworth:\n...Yes. You said you didn't go because you were frightened.\nIris:\n...Th-That's right.\nEdgeworth:\nIf that's the case... ...then the obvious question is, \"What were you so afraid of?\"\nIris:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nIris...

Why are you glaring at me like that?\nEdgeworth:\nYou were scared of the blackmailer who wrote this to you, isn't that correct!?\nIris:\nAaaaah!\n\n1 LOCK BROKEN\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Was it the evidence or the power of my glare that broke that lock...? Oh well, I don't suppose it matters either way.)\nIris:\nB-But, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\n...Yes?\nIris:\nI thought that letter was just someone playing a prank on me...\nEdgeworth:\nA \"prank\"?\nIris:\nWell, yes... After all, even if I did have a \"secret\"... ...there's no one to tell it to that would cause me any grief.\nEdgeworth:\n... Hmm... I wonder about that.\nIris:\nSister Bikini is like a mother to me. I would never hide anything from her!\nEdgeworth:\nNo, you may not have anything to hide under normal circumstances. However! Last night was different.\nIris:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nUnfortunately, I don't know the exact nature of your secret yet. However...! Whatever it is... ...there is one person you didn't want your secret told to!\n\n\n\nPresent Phoenix Wright profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Phoenix Wright...\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWell, Iris?\nIris:\n...Mr. Edgeworth. Is it just possible that maybe... ...you yourself have a deep, dark secret in your heart?\nEdgeworth:\n...! Why do you say that...!?\nIris:\nAs they say, it takes one to know one.\nEdgeworth:\n(How could she have known about that...? Is she peering into my soul!?) ...It's true that there is a deep-seated darkness in my heart. However, the only way I can get rid of it is to fully uncover the truth!\nIris:\nYou mean... the truth behind my secret?\nLeads back to:\n\"Unfortunately, I don't know the exact nature of your secret yet.\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nPhoenix Wright...\nIris:\nAh...!\nEdgeworth:\nYou mean something to Wright, it seems... And I can tell he holds a special place in your heart as well. That's why you didn't want him, of all people, to know your deep, dark secret. Well? What do you have to say?\nIris:\n... I should've expected as much... Especially from a friend of his...\n\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nUnlock Successful\n\n\n\nNote to Iris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis letter... It appears to be addressed to you.\nIris:\n... I think it's someone's idea of a joke, Mr. Edgeworth. That's why I threw it away.\nEdgeworth:\n(She's not giving me a straight answer for some reason. I'm going to have to find someone else who can give me more information about this.)\n\n\n\n\nShichishito\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nI-Is that the murder weapon?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, it is. Have you ever seen it before?\nIris:\nY-Yes. Mystic Ami was holding it... in the courtyard...\nEdgeworth:\n(And apparently, the head nun witnessed the whole sad affair... She saw you stabbing Ms. Elise Deauxnim with this very sword last night...)\nIris:\n...?\n\n\n\n\nLarry Butz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nOh... That's Mr. Laurice. He's a very sincere, hard-working person. He was even kind enough to draw a portrait of me.\nEdgeworth:\n(Knowing Larry... ...this woman is exactly the type that he would fall in love with at first sight.)\n\n\n\n\nBikini profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...I'd like to ask you about Sister Bikini, the head of Hazakura Temple.\nIris:\nShe raised me as if she were my real mother.\nEdgeworth:\n\"As if she were your real mother\"...?\nIris:\nI was left at Hazakura Temple when I was just a small child. And she's taken care of me ever since.\nEdgeworth:\nForgive me for sounding rude, but what about your family?\nIris:\n... I'm sorry, but I'd rather not talk about this.\n\n\n\n\nMaya Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nOh... This is the woman who was to undergo training last night. She seems like a very strong, reliable woman.\nEdgeworth:\n... (Whatever else anyone has to say about this Iris woman... ...I can't exactly say she's the best judge of character.)\n\n\n\n\nPearl Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nThis is the trainee's younger sister, correct? She's cute as a button! And she seems to really love mashed potatoes and gravy!\nEdgeworth:\n...Oh?\nIris:\nShe even said she was going to have the leftovers for dinner the next night... And then she took the leftover potatoes and the whole pot of gravy with her to her room.\nEdgeworth:\n(That's quite an appetite for such a little girl...)February 8Heavenly HallGumshoe:\nWhoa! Not much of a view down here, huh? It's still better than the view from my apartment, though.Edgeworth:\nTsk! Someone's here! Hide yourself, Detective!???:\nOh! Why why why!? Why does this always happen!?Butz:\nWhenever I find a girl I like, they always run away! I even chased one of them to Japan... Next it's going to be prison, I guess. (Changed from [I even chased one of them to Tibet... Next it's going to be prison, I guess.] in the original release) ...I'll steal that detective's wallet. That'll get me locked up for sure. ...Nah. I can't do that to someone who looks like he's down on his luck.Gumshoe:\n...He's just talking to himself.Edgeworth:\nShh! Be quiet and listen!Butz:\nI knew it... I shouldn't have done that! I blew it again...Edgeworth:\n(\"Done that\"? What did he do, I wonder...)Gumshoe:\nHey! You! About what you just said... I got an objection!Butz:\nWh-Wh-Wh-What the...!? Ed-Edgey! You dirty rat!Edgeworth:\n*glare* (Gumshoe... You oaf...!)Gumshoe:\nI-I'm sorry, sir! Before I knew it, I was shouting out, \"Objection!\". And in a loud, commanding voice, too! I even pointed with my pointer finger!Edgeworth:\n...You've watched too many trials.Gumshoe:\nI'm sorry!Edgeworth:\nOK, Larry, the jig is up. What have you got to say for yourself?Butz:\nUngh...Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEagle River\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThis is the Eagle River, sir. It runs pretty fast, so it doesn't ice over, even in the winter.\nEdgeworth:\nIf it had iced over, Wright would have been in some serious trouble.\nGumshoe:\nYou're right about that! He would've landed on the ice, and slid downstream to who knows where.\nEdgeworth:\n(...Not exactly what I meant, but alright...)\n\n\n\n\nDusky Bridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt's a little far, but I have a pretty clear view of Dusky Bridge from here.\nButz:\nAhh. I still can't believe it! ...Really.\nEdgeworth:\n...? What is it, Larry?\nButz:\nHuh! Err, uhh, nothing. It's nothing!\nGumshoe:\nSounds pretty suspicious to me!\nEdgeworth:\n(Something about that statement smells... And you know what they say...)\n\n\n\n\nStairway\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThese go all the way to Dusky Bridge. It's a pretty long, but easy, walk.\nGumshoe:\nI fell down 4 times on my way down here, sir!\nButz:\nOh, sorry about that, Detective. I ate four bananas and tossed their peels on the stairs on my way down here...\nGumshoe:\n... What!? So that's what I was slipping on!\nButz:\nBe careful on the way back. Those deadly banana peels are still out there.\nGumshoe:\nHmm... That's a real important piece of information right there, Mr. Edgeworth!\n\n\n\n\nString of flags\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this festive-looking ornament?\nButz:\nIt reminds me of art class in grade school. We used to have a lot of fun decorating the classroom with origami. Remember?\nEdgeworth:\nW-Well, I...\nButz:\nOh, yeah... You were never any good at it.\nGumshoe:\nReally?\nButz:\nYeah, this guy was so bad, he couldn't even fold a dollar, let alone a crane. Everyone tried to comfort him, but he would just sit there sobbing.\nGumshoe:\nReally? I never would have expected that.\nEdgeworth:\nBe quiet already! I'll never forget the shame of that day! You want a crane! I can now make a perfect quarter-inch crane without a single flaw!\nButz:\n... You know, Edgey... Nothing for nothing, but a quarter-inch crane without a single flaw is not easy.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's quite a feat, Prosecutor Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\n(Grr... This is exactly why I hate childhood friends...)\n\n\n\n\nShack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThat's a horrible graffiti problem you've got there, pal.\nButz:\nYou don't know anything, Detective. This is art! It's an expression of my bittersweet love for Iris.\nEdgeworth:\nLarry. Do you know what the difference between graffiti and true art is?\nButz:\n... It's how the artist himself defines it, right?\nEdgeworth:\n... (I should've seen that one coming.)\nGumshoe:\nWell, if that's the case, then all of my lunchboxes are masterpieces too, pal!\n\n\n\n\nRoof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe straw roof is totally covered with freshly fallen powdery snow.\nGumshoe:\nWow, makes a nice image, doesn't it? I always did like the rustic look.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Heavenly Hall\"... I suppose it's an appropriate name in some sense.\nButz:\nYou got that right. Look at that bridge up there. This place has to be heaven, because that thing is hell.\nEdgeworth:\n... You would do well to remember, Larry... ...that this is a sacred place to some people.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeavenly Hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this little shack anyway?\nButz:\nWell, I just discovered it myself yesterday.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd why were you down here in the first place?\nButz:\nErr, come on... I'm an artist... I was looking for a good place to sketch. This is a great little place! It's err... artistic. It's quiet, it's cold, it's got no power, and it looks like it's about to collapse.\nGumshoe:\n...Sounds a lot like my apartment there, pal.\nEdgeworth:\n(One thing's for sure... No one is likely to show up and disturb you here...)\nButz:\nSo can I get you something to drink? Some hot water, maybe?\nGumshoe:\n...He's getting all buddy-buddy on us, sir.\n\n\n\n\nIris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\n...Listen to me, Edgey. You've gotta do this... You've gotta save Iris!\nEdgeworth:\nWhy are you so sure she's innocent? Because she's cute?\nButz:\nWatch your mouth! Anyway, I've made up my mind about it! I'm going to marry that girl!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nGumshoe:\nUmm... Mr. Edgeworth is pretending he didn't hear you, so I'm gonna ask for him. Have you already asked this girl to marry you?\nButz:\nNo, no. Not yet. But I can tell how she feels by the look in her eyes! She's got this \"I really want this man to carry me over the threshold\" look! I'm sure Nick would be surprised! He'd never imagine that I could marry such a beautiful girl like that!\nEdgeworth:\nSomething tells me he would be shocked, indeed.\nButz:\nThat's why I didn't want her to do anything dangerous. I mean, what am I gonna do if she gets hurt?\nGumshoe:\n... What is this guy trying to say? He lost me about a mile back...\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... If we really want to know the answer to that... (...we're going to have to drag him onto the witness stand.)\n\n\n\n\nThe night of the crime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nCome to think of it, you still haven't answered my question. Where were you and what were you doing last night?\nButz:\nAww, man... Don't you have anything else to talk about? With that kind of attitude, you'll never be a ladies' man like me...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nButz:\nO-OK, OK! Chill out with those scary eyes! I got it! If you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Something incredible\"?\n\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n\nButz:\n...Yeah, yeah. But let's not talk about that now. Let's talk about the good old days. What do you say? Come on, I'll pour you a nice cup of hot water.\nEdgeworth:\n(Why hasn't he realized... ...that I absolutely despise talking about the \"good old days\", especially with him?)\n\n\n\n\nThe night of the crime (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat exactly did you see last night?\nButz:\nWell... It's kinda hard to say...\n\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n\nButz:\nIt's one of those things... Ya know what I mean...? It's like... It's not so much \"what\" I saw, as it's the situation in general... You see what I'm getting at? Whew, that's a relief. Thanks, buddy. Ha ha ha ha ha.\nEdgeworth:\n(I have the strangest urge to smash this guy against those big, nasty locks...)\n\n\n\n\nThe night of the crime (after breaking Psyche-Locks)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo you were here in Heavenly Hall last night, were you not, Larry? And you saw the lightning hit Dusky Bridge, didn't you?\nButz:\nS-Sorry, Edgey...\nGumshoe:\nSorry doesn't cut it, you scumbag! Threatening a young lady like that...\nButz:\n*gulp*... ... Wait, hold up.\nGumshoe:\n...What now, pal?\nButz:\nWhat are you talking about!? What \"threatening\" stuff!?\nGumshoe:\nI'll tell you what! You tried to scare Iris by threatening to expose her secret, pal!\nButz:\nWhat do you mean threaten!? When did I threaten her!?\nGumshoe:\n\"...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed...\" That sure sounds like a threat to me, pal! Blackmail, in fact!\nButz:\nGimme a break! It's a love letter! Haven't you ever been in love!?\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What did you just say!?\nButz:\nMy love for her burns so hotly, it could melt all the snow on this mountain!\nEdgeworth:\nO-Oh? Then what is this secret you mention!?\nButz:\nCome on, Edgey... Don't you get it? I'm talking about the secret love between her and me! Obviously she wouldn't want old lady Bikini to know about it, right...? About our... hot and sour... bittersweet love affair!\nEdgeworth:\n... Alright, then why did you send a love letter in a business-like manila envelope!?\nButz:\nGive me a break! It's not my fault I didn't have any other envelopes! Yeesh!\nGumshoe:\nThen why were you so quick to apologize, pal!?\nButz:\nIt's cuz Edgey gave me that scary look of his!\nEdgeworth:\n... ...\nButz:\nWhat's wrong, Edgey? Why are you so quiet all of a sudden?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's it? THAT'S what all those huge locks were about? (Changed from [That's it? That's all [sic] those huge locks were about?] in the original release) I-I don't understand why you were so defensive...\nButz:\nWell, I dunno either... I guess the thing is... ...you shouldn't expect too much from a guy like me. ...Hey, come on. Don't let it get you down!\nGumshoe:\n... B-But Mr. Edgeworth! This guy is still hiding something! I know it!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nDon't forget what this guy said just a minute ago!\n\n\nButz:\nIf you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible.\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm... He's right!) Larry!\nButz:\nWh-What!? Y-You're looking at me like a hungry dog that just found a bone!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat was this \"something incredible\" you saw last night...? ...You're going to tell me, Larry! One way or another!\n\n\n\n\nSomething incredible (appears after \"The night of the crime\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"I... I already told you, didn't I?\"Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagatama (after clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\n\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n-- The Night of the Crime --\nEdgeworth:\nAlright, now you're going to tell me what you really saw last night...\nButz:\nWhoa. You're really upset, aren't you, Edgey? OK, I'll talk!\nEdgeworth:\n...Huh? (That was a bit too easy...)\nButz:\nYeah, anyway! It was awesome! Never seen anything like it! At around 10 o'clock last night, it started thundering. I'd been sleeping... I'm not sure for how long. Suddenly... ZING! The world in front of me went white! Like I'd just been slapped in the face by my old girlfriend, Naomi!\nEdgeworth:\n...And then?\nButz:\nAnd then... It was on fire! The bridge was on fire!\nEdgeworth:\nDusky Bridge caught on fire!? Are you saying you saw it with your own eyes?\nButz:\nHey! Why are you giving me the evil eye!? I'm telling the truth!\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm... There are still three Psycholocks remaining... (Changed from [Hmm... There are still 3 Psycholocks remaining...] in the original release) That means he's still trying to hide something...) By the way, Larry... Where were you when you saw that happen?\nButz:\nWh-Wh-Wh-Where you say? Wh-Wh-What do you mean!?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean, \"What do I mean\"!? ...Just answer the question!\nButz:\nI-I was in my own room... by the Main Hall! Where else would I be!?\nEdgeworth:\nAs usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar. The problem, I suspect, lies there...\nButz:\nTh-Th-Th-Th-There? Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Whaddya mean th-th-there?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's impossible for you to have seen lightning strike Dusky Bridge from your room!\n\n\n\nPresent Hazakura Temple Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This is a map of the area. Take a look around the vicinity of Hazakura Temple.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nLook at this, Larry!\nButz:\n... Hey, forget about that. Try drinking your hot water. If you don't drink it fast it's going to get cold.\nEdgeworth:\nOh, sorry... (It's cold alright... The water... And my evidence.)\nButz:\nWell? Have you calmed down yet?\nEdgeworth:\nUm, yes... I'm going to think it over again.\nButz:\nH-Hey, I'm telling you... there's nothing to think over! I was in my room doing \"she loves me, she loves me not\" with a bunch of flowers.\nLeads back to:\n\"As usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar.\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis is a map of the area. Take a look around the vicinity of Hazakura Temple.\nButz:\nWh-What am I looking for?\nEdgeworth:\nI think that should be fairly obvious. The Main Hall is surrounded by trees and it's impossible to see the bridge from here.\nButz:\nWhat...!? Why didn't you tell me that before!?\n\n1 LOCK BROKEN\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Well? How about it?\nButz:\nHow about what?\nEdgeworth:\nDo you feel like talking now?\nButz:\nAbout what?\nEdgeworth:\n... (It looks like it won't be that easy after all...) ...You leave me no choice. I'll have to move on to the next step. You weren't in your room at the temple. So then... Where were you?\nButz:\nY-Y-You don't know that I wasn't in my room!\nEdgeworth:\n(So where was Larry, and why was he there...? If I've read the situation up to this point correctly, the answer is fairly obvious.) ...Very well then. Let's test my theory. The place you witnessed lightning striking Dusky Bridge from was... here!\n\n\n\nPresent Heavenly Hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall!\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis is where you were! Well, what do you think, Larry!?\nButz:\nOh... Not much I guess.\nEdgeworth:\n... I'm sorry, but what kind of answer is that?\nButz:\nWell, you were just making small talk, right? Like \"How are you doing?\" or something.\nEdgeworth:\n...Larry. Look at the expression on my face. Do I look like I was just making small talk?\nButz:\nTo be honest? No... I guess not. Ha ha ha ha ha...\nEdgeworth:\n(It appears I didn't think it through carefully enough.)\nLeads back to:\n\"So where was Larry, and why was he there...?\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall!\nButz:\n...Wh-Why would I be hanging out in this old shack? It's freezing cold, there's no electricity, and it could fall apart at any minute...\nEdgeworth:\nLarry... How do you know that anyway? How do you know there's no electricity? After all, it's not that dark yet.\nButz:\nAh... Uh-oh!\nEdgeworth:\nIn other words, you have just provided evidence to prove my theory... My theory that you've at least once in your life visited Heavenly Hall after sunset!\n\n1 LOCK BROKEN\n\nButz:\nI have to admit I'm impressed, Edgey! You're in a totally different league from Nick.\nEdgeworth:\n...That's nice. Now tell me. What were you doing at this cold little shack last night?\nButz:\nThat's what you might call... A \"Fair de Core\".\nEdgeworth:\nI think you mean \"affaire de coeur\". Could it be you were... waiting for someone?\nButz:\nOoooh nooo! Y-You really are one scary guy, you know...\nEdgeworth:\nI believe that last night, you were waiting for this person to come meet you!\n\n\n\nPresent Iris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n \nEdgeworth:\n...Well, Larry!? Was it THIS person...?\nButz:\n...You know what? You should save your finger pointing for the courtroom.\nEdgeworth:\nTsk...!\nButz:\nIt's no wonder people call you a workaholic. You work too hard! You should be like me!\nEdgeworth:\n(Well, I'd rather \"work too hard\" than \"hardly work\" like a loafaholic like you...) In any case... I know you were waiting for someone!\nButz:\nYeah, but... It's like I said. It's an \"affaire de guerre\".\nEdgeworth:\nNo, Larry. You mean \"affaire de coeur\". At least I think you do.\nLeads back to:\n\"Could it be you were... waiting for someone?\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry.\nButz:\nI told you before... Don't call me \"Larry\"...\nEdgeworth:\nThe person you were waiting for was... Iris!\nButz:\nOhh... Suddenly I feel cold all over, Edgey.\nEdgeworth:\nNo doubt because of my chilly glare.\nButz:\nSo you think I got the hots for Sister Iris, huh...? D-Do you have some kind of evidence!? You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing?\nEdgeworth:\n(This is where I draw the line and end this ridiculous little game...) Here's the evidence that you were waiting for Iris...\n\n\n\nPresent Note to Iris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...Here's your evidence.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n... I-Is it just me?\nEdgeworth:\nNow, I'm the one that suddenly feels cold...\nButz:\nMaybe it's because of my cold laugh?\nEdgeworth:\n(Grr... I hate making such stupid mistakes...)\nButz:\nDo you really have the evidence you say you do, Edgey?\nLeads back to:\n\"You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing?\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Here's your evidence. You called her to this spot with a pathetic blackmail letter!\nButz:\nOh! H-Hey! G-G-Give that back! You're embarrassing me! What are you doing with that anyway!?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's not important! ...I misjudged you, Larry.\nButz:\nWhat do you mean...?\nEdgeworth:\nTaking advantage of a woman's frailty like that! You should be ashamed of yourself!\nButz:\nOhhh... OHHHH!\nEdgeworth:\nFirst of all, what's this at the top of the letter? It says, \"Salutation here\"!\nButz:\nW-Well that's what it said in that book, \"Letter Writing for Dummies\"!\nEdgeworth:\nYou're not supposed to actually write that!

Nick was trying to go save her, you know. But instead, he wound up falling off the bridge. I'm not surprised though. Nick always gets himself into trouble.\nEdgeworth:\n(Well if that isn't the pot calling the kettle black...)\nButz:\nI just hope that Maya doesn't catch a cold, too...\nEdgeworth:\n...Or something worse.\n\n\n\n\nPearl Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nOh, hey! It's Pearl! But she's way cuter than this Pearl I used to go out with... Like, in a kid-cute way, yeah?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, well... Apparently she hasn't been seen the whole morning.\nButz:\nWh-What did you say!? Edgey! Why are you wasting your time with me then!? What's wrong with you!?\nEdgeworth:\nExcuse me?\nButz:\nIf anything happens to her, I'll never forgive you!\nEdgeworth:\n...!\nGumshoe:\n...Wow, I guess he's right for a change, sir.\nEdgeworth:\n(Now I feel like I'm the bad guy in all of this...)Butz:\nI...

Mr. Laurice feels that way about... me...?Edgeworth:\nApparently... he isn't aware of your real secret at all.Iris:\n... ......Edgeworth:\nThis is no time to be embarrassed!Iris:\nI-I'm sorry! I'm just... hardly accustomed to that sort of thing.Edgeworth:\nWorry not... And in any case, whatever it was that he saw on the night of the incident... Mark my words, I will drag it out him!Iris:\nDoes that mean... Mr. Laurice is the witness today...?Edgeworth:\n...No. I believe that nun... will be the first to take the stand.Iris:\nSister Bikini...Edgeworth:\nShe claims to have seen the very instant in which you carried out the crime.Iris:\n...Edgeworth:\nI just want to ask you one last time. It really wasn't you who killed Ms. Elise Deauxnim, correct?Iris:\n... That is correct. It wasn't me.Edgeworth:\n...Very well, then.Iris:\nUm... Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\n...Yes?Iris:\nYou are a prosecutor... aren't you? Are you sure about this? If your true identity is revealed...Edgeworth:\nDon't worry. I've made the necessary arrangements. (Changed from [Don't worry. ...I've taken the necessary steps.] in the original release)Iris:\nI-I see... (Changed from [Y-You have...?] in the original release)Edgeworth:\n...Iris. It is a prosecutor's job to doubt people.Iris:\n...Edgeworth:\nBut right now... I am a defense attorney. A defense attorney's job is to believe in people, and to believe until the bitter end. That's what my friend told me once. (Changed from [That's what a friend of mine told me once.] in the original release)Iris:\nMr. Edgeworth...Edgeworth:\nI simply ask that you watch and decide for yourself... (Changed from [You may pass judgment on me from the defendant's chair. You are the one to decide...] in the original release) ...whether or not I am fit to do the task I have been entrusted. (Changed from [...whether or not I am able to do the task I have been entrusted.] in the original release)Iris:\n... ...Very well, sir. I leave my defense in your capable hands.February 9, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 7Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Sister Iris of Hazakura Temple.Edgeworth:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:\n...The defense does indeed appear to be ready... However, the same cannot be said for the prosecution in this case.Edgeworth:\n...Indeed.Judge:\nI'm not sure I like such blatant waste of this court's time. An empty prosecutor's chair can only mean... ...that the prosecutor has no confidence in their ability to prove their case. It would seem this case is already over before it had a chance to begin. I am ready to announce my verdict at this time. This court finds the defendant...???:???:\nThe prosecution... stands ready.Judge:\nA-And you are...?von Karma:\nFranziska von Karma... Prosecuting prodigy.Judge:\nV-Von Karma, you say...? Perchance, you wouldn't be of any relation to the legendary prosecutor Manfred von Karma?von Karma:\n... Legends are a thing of the past. I am a Von Karma. That is all. Upon a special request, I flew in today for the purposes of prosecuting this case.Judge:\nY-You did!? Then... you must be quite a big shot, eh! By the way, Mr. Edgeworth...Edgeworth:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nI'm almost certain that I've seen you somewhere before. Or am I just imagining things? You look very much like a prosecutor I met once...Edgeworth:\n...I believe you are imagining things, Your Honor.Judge:\nMs. von Karma? Do you have anything to say?von Karma:\n... There is no such weakling as this man among those of the Prosecutor's Office.Judge:\nThere... there isn't...? But I'm sure... once before, in this courtroom... Ack!von Karma:\n...I told you, there is no such weakling!Judge:\nWh-What is that!? A whip!? I'm not sure I care for such a thing in my courtroom! B-Bailiff! Remove that whip, at...Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\n...I have no objection to the whip.Judge:\nY-You don't...?Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution can wield a whip or drink seventeen cups of coffee... But there is still only one truth. That is what I stand here to prove today!von Karma:\nThis promises to be interesting... Miles Edgeworth. ...I had expected to face Phoenix Wright here today. But looking at you now... ...maybe this is what I have been waiting for all this time. Miles Edgeworth! I will not allow this chance to crush you slip through my fingers!Edgeworth:\n...I see you brought your flair for the histrionic.Judge:\nAllow me to add to the things I'm not sure about... People acting bizarrely in my court! Uwa-hah!von Karma:\n...The stage is set. Now continue with the proceedings, Your Honor.Judge:\nVery well. Ms. von Karma, please give an outline of this case. With as little whipping as possible!von Karma:\nThe murder victim is the famed picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Her body was found in the Hazakura Temple courtyard. She had been stabbed through the torso by a ceremonial sword from a golden statue.Judge:\nThe sword in this picture... is the weapon in question, correct...? ...Very well. The court accepts this photo of the crime scene.Crime Photo added to the Court Record.von Karma:\nThere is no mistake. This was the doing of Sister Iris. After all... there is a witness to her crime.Judge:\n...Very well. Please bring this witness to the stand!Edgeworth:\n(And so it begins... My first and my last trial... as a defense attorney!)von Karma:\n...Witness. State your name and occupation. Please.Judge:\nH-Hold on here! I'm not sure about being not sure if I care for this at all! Witness! Please stand up nice and straight!Edgeworth:\nIf I recall correctly... ...there are a few milk crates in the Defendant's Lobby for our back pain-plagued witness. (Changed from [...there are a few milk crates in the defendant's lobby for witnesses with bad backs.] in the original release)Judge:\nBailiff! Fetch a crate for this poor lady, please!von Karma:\n...Once again. Your name and occupation, please.Bikini:\nLittle old me? Well, I'm the head nun of Hazakura Temple on Eagle Mountain. My name is Bikini. You got it? Bikini. Nice to meet everyone.Judge:\n... But you don't appear to be wearing a bikini right now... Uwah!von Karma:\n...The courtroom is the garden of holy judgment. Those with lechery in their hearts should leave this sanctuary at once!Judge:\nY-You want me to leave!?Bikini:\nNo need to get your bikinis in a twist! Let me tell you, I'm a sight to behold in summer! Wha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha!Edgeworth:\nIn any case... Witness. I hear that you saw the crime take place on the night in question.Bikini:\nThat's right! I can still hardly believe it myself, to be honest. There's no way dear little Iris could do anything like that...Judge:\nLet us hear what you have to say then. First, tell us aboot your own movements that night, eh!Witness Testimony-- The Night of the Murder --Bikini:\nThat night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But...\nWell, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently.\nSo, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.\nThere's no bath at the Inner Temple, you see, and I needed a long, hot soak.\nIt was after I had finished, just as I was heading back... that's when I saw it!Judge:\nHmm... So it was simply coincidence that you found yourself returning to Hazakura Temple?Bikini:\n...Yes, you could say that. If my back hadn't been in so much pain, I would have stayed at the Inner Temple.Edgeworth:\n(That sounds like a pretty important statement she just made...)von Karma:\nThere is only one problem with this testimony that I can see... And you're not about to fall at the first hurdle, now are you, Miles Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth. ...Please begin your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- The Night of the Murder --Bikini:\nThat night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this Inner Temple...?\nBikini:\nWell, see, conversing with the spirits is what we train people to do, right?\nJudge:\nWe'll be the ones asking you the questions, madam.\nBikini:\n...In order to do that, a place strong in spiritual power is required. There's a small temple across Dusky Bridge, called the Inner Temple.  Acolytes must spend an entire night there to undergo intense training.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd how exactly do you help with this process...?\nBikini:\nIt is all quite exacting. It can't be performed without a nun supervising.\nvon Karma:\nLike a tutor, watching to make sure a spoiled child studies.\nEdgeworth:\n(A tutor with a whip, in your case.) If that is the case... ...then why did you return to Hazakura Temple, where the murder took place?Bikini:\nWell, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nViolently...?\nBikini:\nThat's right. It's no laughing matter, especially in winter! I can't hold anything heavier than a knife and fork during the cold months! Just being alive is like strict training! Wah ha ha! Wha ha! Wah ha ha!\nEdgeworth:\nOn the night of the murder, was this fabulous back of yours hurting again...?\nBikini:\nThat's right. Raging like a bull in a pigpen. I almost fainted once or twice! I just knew that unless I warmed it up, it was going to finally finish me off!Bikini:\nSo, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou \"left Iris to help\"... With what?\nBikini:\nWhat do you think? The acolyte's training, of course. It was just past 10 PM, so we were starting to enter into the training exercises proper.\nJudge:\nWasn't it your place to remain with the disciple?\nBikini:\nWell, the job is simply to watch over the acolyte so that they don't pass away.\nEdgeworth:\nJust to confirm this point again, that night... ...you met Iris in the Inner Temple, correct?\nBikini:\nYes, yes. She's a gentle, honest girl. She's never once failed to follow my directions.Present Iris's Testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Witnesses have to undergo their own trials, I'm afraid. The defendant's fate rests on their powers of observation and memory, after all.\nBikini:\nWell, well, well. Don't worry! I'm more than up to the task! I'm a woman of faith, after all. The head honcho of Hazakura Temple.\nEdgeworth:\nIn that case, Ms. Honcho... I'd like you to explain something for me. The discrepancy between your testimony and that of the defendant, Iris. She claims that after ringing the lights out bell, she went back and stayed in her room. ...Which means! She did not go to the Inner Temple at all!\nBikini:\nN... No...! She said that...?\nvon Karma:\n\nvon Karma:\nA defendant or a witness... Who is more likely to lie, do you suppose? The defendant is simply lying to cover her back!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nBut that is completely illogical. The murder was committed in the courtyard of Hazakura Temple. Claiming that she \"went to the Inner Temple\" would make for a much better alibi.\nvon Karma:\n...!\nBikini:\nBut that is odd... Whatever the reason... I can't believe that she would lie...!\nJudge:\nHmm... she does indeed have honest eyes! Uwaaaah!\nvon Karma:\n...All people lie. That is my belief.\nJudge:\nWhy am I the only one being whipped in here...!? Anyway! Neither the witness nor the defendant have any reason to lie! Which means... We must call your memory into question...\nBikini:\nDear, dear, dear. You're older than me and yet you want to play that game, do you?\nJudge:\nA-Ah, well, that isn't exactly what I...\nBikini:\nMy memory is perfect! Crystal clear! Especially in winter!\nJudge:\nThen... I suppose it's too early to end this cross-examination, eh. Mr. Edgeworth. If you are going to question the memory of this witness... ...you will need to show me a more decisive piece of evidence.\nEdgeworth:\n...Understood, Your Honor. (I was naïve to think that alone would do the trick.)\nJudge:\nThen please add your comments aboot Iris to the testimony... And let us return to the cross-examination.\nChanges statement from \"So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.\" to \"Iris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner.\"Bikini:\nIris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nAre you sure that you're not making a mistake...?\nBikini:\n...You, young man, need to get your estimation of me up from the floor!\nEdgeworth:\nNngh...!\nBikini:\nIris always wears the same clothes. The smallest thing out of place would have stood out like a sore thumb to me! You're making a mistake, thinking I made a mistake!\nJudge:\n...An excellent finish there, witness.\nEdgeworth:\n(Still, I have to wonder...)Present Iris's Hood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...Witness. Let's get one thing straight.\"Bikini:\nThere's no bath at the Inner Temple, you see, and I needed a long, hot soak.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...So you returned to the Hazakura Temple in order to take a bath?\nBikini:\nMy back is to blame for everything. It's a \"do or be done in\" kind of world, after all.\nEdgeworth:\nHow long were you in the bath for, if you don't mind me asking?\nBikini:\n... My my my, what a filthy little rogue you are! I know what's on your mind!\nEdgeworth:\n...?\nBikini:\nI bet your next question is going to be, \"Where exactly did you wash?\" Ah, THIS is why you have to watch the young ones...\nEdgeworth:\nW-What are you going on about!? I was... Gwah!\nvon Karma:\n...Pathetic, Miles Edgeworth.\nJudge:\nThe lowest of the low.\nEdgeworth:\n(Is there some sort of \"Kick Me\" sign stuck to the defense's bench!?)\nBikini:\nAnyway, I couldn't afford to be away from my post for too long, you understand, so...Bikini:\nIt was after I had finished, just as I was heading back... that's when I saw it!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe crime took place in the courtyard, correct...?\nBikini:\nWhen you go from my room to the Main Hall... ...you have to take a winding hallway from which you can see the courtyard.\nvon Karma:\nThat's right. In other words... ...it was pure coincidence that the witness saw the crime taking place before her eyes. There was no complicated set-up in this case!\nJudge:\nHmm... That certainly seems to be true.Edgeworth:\n(There is indeed only one problem with this testimony. If I can clearly point out what it is, then I can begin to quantify... ...just how good this witness's memory and observation skills are.)Edgeworth:\n...Witness. Let's get one thing straight. The defendant whom you claim to have met... ...she was wearing this \"Demon-Warding Hood\", correct?Bikini:\nOf course! That is a very important piece of clothing, I'll have you know! Wha ha ha! Wha ha ha! Ha ha... Wait a minute...von Karma:von Karma:\nH-Hold it right there! Why do you have that...!?Edgeworth:\nThat's the question of the day, now isn't it... Ms. von Karma? I'll have you know that this hood was given to someone as a gift that night. Before the lights out bell was rung.von Karma:\nW... What!?Edgeworth:\n...You know where I'm going with this, don't you? If the witness had seen the defendant as she claims... ...then the Iris she saw should have been missing this very hood! (Changed from [...the defendant couldn't have been wearing this very hood!] in the original release)Bikini:\nWell well well!Edgeworth:\n(It's not a bad feeling at all, exposing contradictions like this... Now I understand that happy look on Wright's face every time he does it...)Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Witness, your response... Wuahaaa!von Karma:\n...Sister. This hood... You have spare ones around the temple, don't you?Bikini:\nSpares... Well... I do tend to make too many of them.Judge:\nI see... A stockpile. A surplus of hoods, eh?Bikini:\nEach nun is only given one hood. This should be the only hood that Iris owned...Judge:\nHmm... Then this is quite strange! Waaaah!von Karma:\nIf there was a surplus of hoods, then she could have worn one of those! ...There is no contradiction here!Judge:\nHmm...Edgeworth:\n(I'm sorry to break this to you, Ms. von Karma... but you won't get away that easily. Discrepancies such as this will sow seeds in any human heart. The seeds of doubt.)Judge:\n...Witness. While I don't wish to call your testimony into doubt... ...you must give every detail with precision.Bikini:\nI-I'm not sure I'm comfortable going along with this...von Karma:\nSister. You shall continue with your testimony. Tell us what you saw after finishing your bath, on your way back to the Inner Temple!Edgeworth:\n(Those seeds of doubt are sprouting in the judge's heart. They just need a little more stimulation to bear fruit... Contradictory stimulation.)Witness Testimony-- After My Bath --Bikini:\nI finished my bath around 11, and I thought I should return to the Inner Temple.\nAnd as I was walking back... I heard a noise from the courtyard. I took a look and...\nIris was...! Oh, Mystic Elise! And with that sword, of all things!\nMystic Elise was staying in the corner room, which faces out onto the courtyard.\nThe stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window.Judge:\nYou saw a truly terrible sight, didn't you...? If I was in your place... ...then it would be much like Ms. von Karma whipping Mr. Edgeworth in two in court! And me, seeing it all from this very chair! ...Er, well, something like that.Edgeworth:\n(This judge... His imagination is about as vivid and creative as Detective Gumshoe...)von Karma:\nI would look the fool if I commented on such foolishness. Anyway, this case is mine... Miles Edgeworth!Edgeworth:\nCalling everyone by their full name... Can't you do something about that habit of yours?Cross Examination-- After My Bath --Bikini:\nI finished my bath around 11, and I thought I should return to the Inner Temple.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...How far is it from your room to the Inner Temple?\nBikini:\nLet me think a moment... About twenty minutes, on these stumps of mine. It's about 15 minutes to Dusky Bridge from Hazakura Temple. The Inner Temple is just beyond the bridge.\nvon Karma:\nStill, you never made it back there that night, did you?\nBikini:\nT-That's right... I was heading along the walkway toward the Main Hall...Bikini:\nAnd as I was walking back... I heard a noise from the courtyard. I took a look and...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou say you heard a noise...?\nBikini:\n\"Thump\"... Just like that.\nvon Karma:\n...That could only be the sound of the victim falling.\nBikini:\nIt's very quiet in the temple, you know. You can even hear the snow falling from the branches. \"Thump\"... Just like that.\nJudge:\nBut then, couldn't this noise you heard have been snow falling to the ground?\nBikini:\n... I never thought of that. Wah ha ha. Wha ha ha. Ha ha...\nJudge:\nHoh hoh. Hoh hoh. Hoh hoh... Uaaaaaah!\nvon Karma:\nThe next one to laugh gets a whipping!\nBikini:\nWell. Whatever the source of the sound, I looked over at the courtyard and...Bikini:\nIris was...! Oh, Mystic Elise! And with that sword, of all things!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...This is the second time that the witness has testified to seeing the defendant. But... some doubt remains in these claims.\nBikini:\nHey, just what does that mean!? Just because you're a good-looking young man doesn't give you the right to...\nEdgeworth:\nThe murderer who stabbed the victim with the sword... Sister Bikini, try to recall exactly who it was you saw! As clearly as you can!\nBikini:\nHmm... Well. You're a handsome young man, so I'll forgive you. ... Oh! Now that you mention it... There was something awfully strange about her... Something that has been bugging me all this time!\nEdgeworth:\n...Please, don't keep us in suspense.\nBikini:\nHer hood!\nvon Karma:\nHer hood...?\nBikini:\nThat's right! ...It's coming back to me... Iris... She wasn't wearing her hood! I thought something was out of place, but... It all makes sense now, doesn't it? After all, she'd given that hood away to someone, right?\nEdgeworth:\n...Urk!\nvon Karma:\nHah... You've dug your own grave, Miles Edgeworth!\nJudge:\nWhat do you say, Mr. Edgeworth? Is this testimony important?\n\n\n\nIt's not important\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(...This line of questioning is only going to tear the  wound open further.) These statements are as useless as the investigations of a certain detective. ...There is no need to record them.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nJudge:\nVery well. ...Please, continue with your testimony.\nvon Karma:\nHmph...\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nIt's important\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(This may initially appear to put me at a disadvantage... But, I can't see any other leads at the moment...) ...Your Honor. I would like these new statements to be added to the testimony.\nvon Karma:\nHeh... Miles Edgeworth.\nvon Karma:\nIf you want to hang yourself, you need only to ask. I'll gladly lend you my whip!\nJudge:\nWitness. Add that statement to your testimony.\nBikini:\n...No problem.\nAdds statement \"Now that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on.\"Bikini:\nNow that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou are sure about that...?\nBikini:\nYes. After all, we always wear the same clothes. Ah! I don't mean because we're poor, you understand? It's our style. Yes, that's it!\nEdgeworth:\n...There's absolutely no need to explain yourself.\nBikini:\nAnyway! She looked different from normal, so that really stuck out.\nvon Karma:\nLike me holding a whippet puppy instead of my whip.\nEdgeworth:\n(At least then it might bite you and not someone else...)\nBikini:\nIris didn't have her hood on. I'm sure of it!\nJudge:\n...Very well. Now, please tell us aboot the victim, eh.Bikini:\nMystic Elise was staying in the corner room, which faces out onto the courtyard.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe room the victim was staying in overlooked the courtyard, correct?\nJudge:\nWhich means... the victim's room was on the second floor?\nBikini:\nNo, no. Hazakura Temple is a single story building. But the mountain itself slopes downward... ...which elevates the Main Gate side of the temple and the guest rooms in the back... ...to about the height of a two story building.\nJudge:\nI see... And the victim was staying in one of these elevated rooms, correct?\nBikini:\nYes... I should know. I'm the one who carried her things to her room, after all...Bikini:\nThe stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat makes you so sure of all this...?\nBikini:\nIt's just like I told you earlier... \"I heard a noise from the courtyard.\" OK? \"Thump\"... Just like that.\nvon Karma:\nYou're one smart sister, I'll give you that. The autopsy report states that... ...the victim's body was covered in bruises... ...indicating a fall from around 10 feet in height.\nJudge:\nHmm... It appears that the witness was not mistaken then.\nBikini:\nYep. Yep. I'm more than just a pretty face. Especially in winter! I'm a woman of faith, after all. The head honcho of Hazakura Temple.\nEdgeworth:\n(There's only two of them working there...!)\nvon Karma:\nWhat's wrong, Miles Edgeworth? No snappy comeback remark?\nEdgeworth:\n...Present Elise's Autopsy Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...Impressive logic. That's what I'd like to say, anyway.\"Edgeworth:\n(...It doesn't feel like she is lying. This is very powerful testimony, too. She claims to have seen the instant in which the defendant stabbed the victim... There are only two things I can believe in right now... My client, Iris, and my own abilities as a defense attorney.)Edgeworth:\n...Impressive logic. That's what I'd like to say, anyway.Bikini:\nOh please, do! My brain is something else... especially in winter!Edgeworth:\nHowever... I think you are overlooking one thing. ...Ms. von Karma. Would you be so kind as to take another look at the autopsy report?von Karma:\nT-The autopsy report...?Edgeworth:\nThe victim did fall from a height of 10 feet. ...However. This fall... was after she was killed.von Karma:\nAh...!Judge:\nT-That's right! It says \"after death\" right here!Edgeworth:\nThe scene the witness claims to have seen is contradictory! If the defendant stabbed and killed the victim there in the courtyard... ...how did the victim then go on to take a ten foot fall!?von Karma:\nAaah!Judge:\nO-Order! Order! The victim was killed and then fell! If that is the case... ...then the victim must have been killed in her room... Don't you agree?von Karma:\nTh-That is the logical conclusion... Yes, that's right! The victim must have been stabbed by the defendant in her own room! And she was then thrown out of her window down into the courtyard below!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nWere there any signs of a struggle in Ms. Deauxnim's room...?von Karma:\n...!Edgeworth:\nShe was stabbed with a sword! That would leave a blood stain, wouldn't you agree?Judge:\nW-Well, Ms. von Karma? Was there any blood...? Waaaaaah!von Karma:\n...No traces of blood were found in the victim's room.Judge:\n...Your whip has just caused traces of blood to be found on my glorious playoff beard. However! If there was no blood in the room, then your claim that... Waaaaah!von Karma:\nI'm sure there's no need for me to go over this... ...as I'm sure Your Honor is well aware... ...of when a stab wound produces the most blood.Judge:\nWhen it produces the most blood...?von Karma:\nVery little blood is actually lost at the moment of a blade's insertion. If you want to talk about when the most blood would be lost from a body... ...that would be when the blade is removed.Edgeworth:\nIndeed. With the weapon still in place... ...it acts like a lid on the wound.Judge:\nThat's true... With the weapon still in the body, there wouldn't be much bleeding... A perfectly reasonable line of thinking!von Karma:\nWe have come to a conclusion then! The victim was thrown out of the window with the sword still in place... This removes all of the contradictions!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! I must admit that this is a probable version of events!Edgeworth:\n(I'd expect no less from Franziska von Karma... She locates and takes control of every vital point!)von Karma:\n...Hmph...Judge:\nIt seems... ...that we need a clearer testimony from the witness. Remove all supposition on your part and tell us only the truth, please! Witness! Please! Remain standing on the crate!Bikini:\nDon't go selling me short now! The weight of winter snow has bent me out of shape! ...Especially my back and my mood!von Karma:\nSister. Please, give us your testimony. I will give you a vigorous massage once we are finished here.Edgeworth:\n(...With the whip?)Bikini:\n...Oh, boy. Alright, alright...Witness Testimony-- Further Details --Bikini:\nWhen I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place.\nThinking about it now, I didn't actually see her stab Mystic Elise.\nI've never seen so much blood before...\nThat's when I fainted. You can't blame me, can you?\nAnd when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back!Judge:\nHmm... This all confirms Ms. von Karma's theory...von Karma:\nVon Karmas strive for nothing but perfection. Putting together such facts is nothing for me! You should know that, Miles Edgeworth!Edgeworth:\n(\"Perfection\" is an impossibility, Franziska von Karma... And I'm here to teach you just that...)Cross Examination-- Further Details --Bikini:\nWhen I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nAt that time... was the victim bleeding?\nBikini:\nWell... I was very shocked to be seeing all this, of course... So I'm not entirely sure... But I don't think I saw any blood. Not then.\nvon Karma:\n...I'm sure that you didn't. The weapon was acting as a plug in the wound.\nEdgeworth:\nIn any case... Let's be clear on one very important point. Did you actually see the instant in which the victim was stabbed!?Bikini:\nThinking about it now, I didn't actually see her stab Mystic Elise.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Think carefully. This is very important.\nBikini:\nIt's Iris we are talking about here! I'm thinking for all I'm worth! ... No, when I looked over, the sword was already in Mystic Elise's body.\nJudge:\nHmmmmmm...\nEdgeworth:\n(It might not be  conclusive, but... ...this testimony supports her theory.)\nvon Karma:\nThe victim was stabbed in her room and then dropped into the courtyard... ...I think this proves it rather well, Miles Edgeworth.Bikini:\nI saw the instant in which the blade, plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n\"Smoothly\", you say... You're saying you saw the sword smoothly slide out?\nBikini:\nThat's right...\nBikini:\nThe whole thing happened right next to the gold statue of Mystic Ami. Mystic Elise was on the ground, and Iris was stooped over her. The sword was buried up to the hilt. When Iris stood up, the sword in her hand just slid out of Mystic Elise's body. It slid out from that gaping wound...! Aaaah...\nJudge:\nIt goes without saying... that if the sword was removed there would be bleeding.\nvon Karma:\n...Nothing out of place here.\nEdgeworth:\n(Is that really the case...? I can't help but feel that something about this testimony is very out of place... That something which couldn't possibly have happened... appears to have happened.)Present Shichishito\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Sister Bikini. You are a reliable witness...\"Bikini:\nI've never seen so much blood before...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...So you're saying that you saw the victim's blood?\nBikini:\nT-That's right! Some of it had splattered onto Iris, too...\nvon Karma:\nWhen the defendant was arrested, she was meditating in her room. And her blood-flecked clothing was neatly folded in the corner.\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What!? (Her clothes were blood-flecked as well...?)\nJudge:\nHmmm... That seems quite conclusive to me...\nEdgeworth:\n(What should I do...? Press this point further?)\n\n\n\nStop here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I can't afford to make things look any worse for the defendant. I'll bide my time for now.)\nJudge:\n...Witness. Please continue your testimony. From after you witnessed the victim bleeding!\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nGoing back to your previous statement... ...you said that you saw little bleeding when the victim was stabbed. But now... you say you saw the victim bleeding...?\nBikini:\nWell, well. I say that what I saw is what I saw.\nJudge:\nW-What did you see?\nBikini:\nMaybe I didn't see the poor woman get stabbed... But I saw the girl pull the sword out of her, plain as day.\nEdgeworth:\nPulling the sword out...?\nBikini:\nWell, it wasn't exactly pulling... It was more like it \"came out\".\nJudge:\nWitness! You will add this statement to your testimony!\nBikini:\nOh... Was that important...!?\nEdgeworth:\n(More important than you can imagine...)\nAdds statement \"I saw the instant in which the blade, plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out.\"Press (after adding statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWas the bleeding caused by the killer removing the sword...?\nBikini:\nNo mistaking it! I remember it all, clear as day!\nEdgeworth:\n...Don't you think that's a bit odd?\nvon Karma:\nWhat do you mean, Miles Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nWhy would the killer pull out the sword?\nvon Karma:\nWhat...?\nEdgeworth:\nIf all she wanted to do was place the weapon in the hand of the gold statue... ...then there was no reason to remove it from the body. All that would've accomplished is causing the victim to bleed unnecessarily. ...Your thoughts, Ms. von Karma?\nvon Karma:\nT-That's...\nJudge:\nIndeed... It is strange, now that you mention it.\nEdgeworth:\n(I'm going to need to find an answer to this mystery, too...)\nvon Karma:\nA-Anyway! The witness saw something terrible! ...So what did you do after that, witness?Bikini:\nThat's when I fainted. You can't blame me, can you?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nNow, on to what the killer did next... You saw none of it? Correct?\nBikini:\nWell... I was unconscious...\nvon Karma:\nHow long were you out for?\nBikini:\nI don't know... 10, maybe 20 minutes...? A young man with a very prickly looking head woke me up. ...By stepping on me, actually.\nJudge:\nHmm... I'm not sure I like that method of resuscitation!\nBikini:\nWell, I wasn't asking for mouth-to-mouth, or anything of the sort... ...but I would've welcomed a more gentle awakening right about then, let me tell you.\nEdgeworth:\n...I shall have words with the offender personally. What did you see upon awakening...?Bikini:\nAnd when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nBy \"Mystic Ami\", you are referring to the golden statue, correct?\nBikini:\nJust stabbing someone with the Shichishito, a sacred treasure, is terrible enough.\nBikini:\nBut to then make Mystic Ami hold the blade...!\nvon Karma:\nTruly, a heinous, despicable crime.\nEdgeworth:\nIt is easy to despise something. Anyone can do it. However, there is something that cannot be done so easily...\nvon Karma:\nWhatever it is, I'm sure it's doubly hard for you. Anyway, what is the problem?\nEdgeworth:\nExactly why would the killer set up this gruesome scene? Can anyone explain the reasoning behind that?\nvon Karma:\n...!\nJudge:\nHmmmmm... No, I don't think I can.\nvon Karma:\n... There isn't always a logical reason behind why someone acts!\nBikini:\nThat's true, so true. In early spring, for example, I often find myself...\nEdgeworth:\n(\"There isn't always\"... That phrase might come in handy someday.)Edgeworth:\n(There are too many unnatural elements in this case... Why was it necessary to use the Shichishito from the Ami statue as a weapon? Why was the weapon finally placed back in the hand of the statue? If I can expose the flaws in this testimony, perhaps then I will begin to find the truth.)Edgeworth:\nSister Bikini. You are a reliable witness... At least, I'd like to think so. But there are too many contradictions here.Bikini:\nW-What do you mean? You make it sound as though I'm a liar! But... You're a handsome young man, so I'll forgive you.von Karma:\nWhat contradictions are you talking about?Edgeworth:\nIn the scene that the witness claims to have seen... ...the weapon was thrust up to its hilt into the victim. Furthermore... the killer withdrew the weapon smoothly from the body. ...However! Both of these are complete impossibilities!Judge:\nWhat do you mean...? Please, explain you... Uwaaaaah!von Karma:\nExplain yourself!Edgeworth:\nTo start with... Do you think it would be possible to stab someone to the hilt with this? No matter how I look at the defendant, she doesn't appear strong enough for that.von Karma:von Karma:\n\"Doesn't appear\"...? What meaningless dribble! I, too, may appear to be weak and frail... But I can crush men under my heel and make them weep, should I so choose!Judge:\nThe objection stands! I wept a little back there, I must admit.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\n...That isn't the only issue here. If this sword was truly stabbed into the body up to the hilt... Well, just look at all the branches on it. It certainly wouldn't come out smoothly.von Karma:\nT-That's...Edgeworth:\nWe also have the problem of the amount of bleeding. It's true that when a blade is left in a body, it acts as a \"plug\" of sorts. However! When the weapon is shaped like this, it's an entirely different story. The wound would be too large for the blade to completely stop from bleeding!von Karma:von Karma:\nT-That's nothing more than conjecture! In reality, the victim was stabbed with the Shichishito. Even a weapon of this nature... ...may still sometimes slide out smoothly, and may still sometimes stop the blood loss!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nI'm not finished. There is still one more... conclusive contradiction.Judge:\nY-You've still got more!?Edgeworth:\n...This one is simple. If this sword really was thrust in all the way to the hilt... ...why is there only blood on the tip of it?von Karma:\nAh...!Edgeworth:\nIf this witness is telling the truth... Then there should be blood along the entire length of the sword!von Karma:\nNoooooo!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Ord-- Whaaaaaaaa!von Karma:\nBravo... Miles Edgeworth. Raising this many contradictions from a single piece of evidence! All the other attorneys I know could maybe manage one, if that!Judge:\nBut what does this all mean!? You have proven contradictions regarding the murder weapon, but...Edgeworth:\n...Having come this far, there can only be one answer.von Karma:\nAnd that is...?Edgeworth:\nThe weapon used to kill the victim... ...was not the Shichishito!Judge:\nW-Whaaaaaaaaat!?von Karma:\nA foolishly foolish idea born from the foolish mind of a foolhardy foolish fool.Edgeworth:\nLet's examine this again. What was it that made us think this sword was the murder weapon?Bikini:\nW-Well... It's because Mystic Ami was holding it...Edgeworth:\n...Exactly. However! If you reflect on this, that is the only basis we have to assume such a thing. The impression left by the scene was just too strong. That is what influenced us. It influenced us to believe that the Shichishito was the murder weapon!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! Waaaaaaaaah!von Karma:\nSo maybe the Shichishito was not the murder weapon. Even if that is the case... it changes nothing, Miles Edgeworth! The Sister here saw everything! She saw the defendant stab the victim with a sword-like object.Judge:\nHmmmmmm... That's true! Your response, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\n... If that is so... I would like the prosecution to answer the obvious question it raises.Judge:\nThe obvious... question?Edgeworth:\n...Yes. Namely... Where did the real murder weapon disappear to?von Karma:\n...!Edgeworth:\nIt goes without saying that the police searched the Main Hall and the surrounding area. ...Perhaps the prosecution can enlighten us as to if a \"sword-like object\" was found.von Karma:\nT-That's...Judge:\nAnswer the question, Ms. von Karma!von Karma:\n... No evidence of that kind was found.Judge:\nHmmmmm... Another mystery to throw onto the pile! A trial without a murder weapon is a tricky beast!Bikini:\nExcuse me... Could I say something...? I just remembered something, actually...von Karma:\n...What is it, Sister?Bikini:\nI was just thinking... It's possible... ...that just maybe... what actually happened was... it was just over there...Judge:\n... What exactly are you going on aboot here?Bikini:\nThe murder weapon, I mean! Maybe... I think I might know where the sword was disposed of!Edgeworth:\nYou what!?von Karma:\nWell then... I think we need to hear testimony from you one more time, Sister.Edgeworth:\n(Impossible...! What else... What else could this old woman have seen!?)Witness Testimony-- Location of the Weapon --Bikini:\nI saw the murder at around 11 PM...\nAnd after asking that it be reported, I went out to the Main Gate.\nAnd there... I saw tracks! Tracks that indicated the snowmobile had been used!\nIt takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, but less than 5 using one of those!\nMaybe they threw the weapon into Eagle River and came back while I was knocked out?\n...Iris could have done that. She can drive a snowmobile after all...Judge:\nHmmmmmm... Witness. Please, tell us everything you know right away next time.Bikini:\nWell. I'm not in the best of shape. What with my back and my age, you know.von Karma:\nQuite... There were indeed snowmobile tracks in front of the Main Gate. Here is a photograph.Judge:\nA snowmobile, eh... I see. Well, it certainly is an interesting theory...von Karma:\nThe tracks begin in front of Hazakura Temple... ...and run all the way to Dusky Bridge!Tracks Photo added to the Court Record.von Karma:\n...That solves your pesky little problem, yes? The Eagle River's current is quite swift, meaning that it doesn't freeze over in winter. Making it the perfect place to dispose of the murder weapon!Edgeworth:\n(Did she really go to the river to dispose of the murder weapon...?)Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth! ...Your cross-examination, please.Cross Examination-- Location of the Weapon --Bikini:\nI saw the murder at around 11 PM...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...You are sure about the time?\nBikini:\nYes... I was worried about it, after all.\nJudge:\nWhy was that?\nBikini:\nBecause I have a strong sense of responsibility. Especially at this time of year. The acolyte was being doused in freezing water at the time... I couldn't very well take it easy in the bath all night now, could I? So at 11, I decided to leave Hazakura Temple.\nEdgeworth:\n(Her estimation of the time seems reliable, at least.)\nvon Karma:\nPlease continue, Sister.Bikini:\nAnd after asking that it be reported, I went out to the Main Gate.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou asked Phoenix Wright to report the crime, correct?\nBikini:\nRight, right, the one who trampled me.\nEdgeworth:\n(It seems she is the type to hold a grudge...)\nBikini:\nThere isn't a phone in the Main Hall, so I sent him to the bridge.\nvon Karma:\nPhoenix Wright... He didn't even have his cell phone on him?\nEdgeworth:\nHe had forgotten it at home, apparently.\nvon Karma:\nWhat a naïve boy, as always! Not only do I always carry my phone, but I always have my whip in hand, too!\nBikini:\nAnyway, I was really scared... And it was taking him a while to get back... So I thought I'd go out by the Main Gate for a spell.Bikini:\nAnd there... I saw tracks! Tracks that indicated the snowmobile had been used!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nAs I recall, there was a snowmobile outside the Main Gate when I visited.\nBikini:\nThat's it. That's the only one we have. It'll run no matter how much snow falls!\nEdgeworth:\nNow, you're certain the snowmobile was there at the Main Gate when you arrived?\nBikini:\nYes, of course. It was parked in front of the gate.\nvon Karma:\nSo... she had already gone, discarded the murder weapon, and returned by that time.\nEdgeworth:\n(...I'm not sure if this is really relevant... What should I do...?)\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(...I need answers to every possible doubt.) The snowmobile in question... Was it still warm at that time?\nBikini:\nHuh? Huh? Huh? Huh? What do you mean? What do you mean?\nJudge:\nWhat do you mean, eh?\nvon Karma:\nWhat do you mean, Miles Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\n(...I'm playing to a slow crowd here.) It goes without saying that using a snowmobile will heat its engine. If it was still warm, then it means it was recently used.\nBikini:\nAh! I see! I never thought of that!\nJudge:\nHmmm, that's right! I overlooked that, too!\nvon Karma:\n...Of course you did.\nEdgeworth:\nThen answer the question please, witness.\nBikini:\n... I don't often go around touching hot engines...\nEdgeworth:\n...Hmm.\nBikini:\nHowever... Now that you mention it... There wasn't any snow on it.\nJudge:\nSnow...?\nBikini:\nYes. For some reason, only the snowmobile wasn't covered in snow...\nEdgeworth:\n(There wasn't any snow on it!? Curses!)\nJudge:\nIt seems highly likely that the killer did use the snowmobile then, eh!\nvon Karma:\nHow long does it take to get to Dusky Bridge by snowmobile?\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nStop here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(It looks very likely that the snowmobile is related to this case. I can't help but think that Iris used it... But for what...? I'd better hold off on this... for now.)\nJudge:\n...Well then, witness.\nJudge:\nHow long does it take to reach the bridge by snowmobile?\nLeads back to cross-examinationBikini:\nIt takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, but less than 5 using one of those!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nIn that case... why didn't you use it yourself? You could've spared yourself some walking.\nBikini:\nAh! There's a reason for that! Have we got a moment for me to explain?\nJudge:\nI think that's why the question was asked in the first place...\nBikini:\n...It was about a month ago. I was driving my beloved little snowmobile, happy as can be. I'd fetched some water and was heading back when I went and crashed into a tree! The tree and my back both went crunch. Just like that. Crunch.\nJudge:\nHmm... Crunch.\nBikini:\n...I haven't been able to find the courage to ride anything since then...\nBikini:\nAnyway, the killer must have used it!Bikini:\nMaybe they threw the weapon into Eagle River and came back while I was knocked out?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nRefresh our memory. How long were you knocked out for...?\nBikini:\nLike I said, somewhere between 10 to 20 minutes.\nvon Karma:\nIt's possible to get to the bridge and back in 10 minutes using the snowmobile...\nEdgeworth:\n...I have to concede that is more than enough time.\nvon Karma:\nIs that all you wish to concede, Miles Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n...Present Tracks Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I admit this photograph proves something.\"Bikini:\n...Iris could have done that. She can drive a snowmobile after all...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhile it would have been possible, time-wise... ...one element remains out of place here.\nJudge:\nOh? And what would this mystery element be?\nEdgeworth:\nThe killer's reasoning, Your Honor. \"Why did the killer do all of this?\" Why go to the Eagle River to dispose of the murder weapon when there are other methods?\nJudge:\nHmm... Too many unanswered questions! Your response, Ms. von Karma? Waaaaaaaah!\nvon Karma:\nTurning to me for help over the slightest thing! Why don't you think for yourself once in a while? ...Your Honor.\nJudge:\nWhaaaaat!?\nEdgeworth:\n(She's as over the top as always...)\nvon Karma:\nA-Anyway... Whatever the reason, the fact remains that the defendant could have done this! The murder weapon was disposed of in the river! Another point to me, Miles Edgeworth!Present Tracks Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I admit this photograph proves something.\"Edgeworth:\n(Another mystery to feed the fire... \"Was there any reason to go and throw away the murder weapon\"...? Luckily, there is surely a problem with this testimony. Now all I have to do is start poking holes in this flawed account...)Edgeworth:\nI admit this photograph proves something. It proves that the snowmobile was used on the night of the murder.von Karma:\nYou've finally accepted the inevitable, it seems... Miles Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\nHowever... If what the witness says is true, why is there only one set of tracks?von Karma:\nWhat do you mean...?Edgeworth:\nIris left Hazakura Temple, threw the weapon into the river, and then returned. If this was the case, then naturally there should be two sets of tracks in the snow! Those from heading out to the bridge, and those from coming back.Bikini:\n... Ah...! You're right!von Karma:\nHmph... You are forgetting one thing, Miles Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\n...?von Karma:\nOn the night of the murder, it was snowing. The tracks leading to the bridge were erased by the snowfall. This removes your precious contradiction, now doesn't it!Judge:\nI see! While she was at the river, the snow stopped... ...leaving just the return tracks in the snow.von Karma:\nWhat do you have to say now, Miles Edgeworth!Edgeworth:\n(Is there a flaw in her theory...? This idea that the snowfall covered one set of tracks...?)It's flawless.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...The tracks leading to the bridge were covered by the snow.\nEdgeworth:\nI do not have any evidence that can dispute this claim.\nvon Karma:\n...In which case, the rest is simple. Sister. Who was the only person who could have driven the snowmobile that night?\nBikini:\nWell... that would be...!\nvon Karma:\n...You can't hide it. I already know the answer.\nBikini:\n......... It could only be Iris.\nJudge:\nA-And the reason being...!?\nBikini:\nThere is only one key for the snowmobile.\nvon Karma:\nA key... that the defendant is responsible for!\nEdgeworth:\nWhaaaaat!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Now I don't feel like a clueless Puck Bunny! I understand everything! If the defendant did indeed use the snowmobile... ...which means that Iris is most definitely the murder--\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Your Honor! Please, wait a moment.\nJudge:\nWhat is it, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nThere is one gaping hole in Ms. von Karma's claim!\nJudge:\n... I'm not sure if I care for your response, Mr. Edgeworth. Next time, bring up whatever issues you have earlier. Do you understand!?\nEdgeworth:\nNngh... (I should have noticed it sooner...!)\nLeads to:\n\"The tracks to the river were covered by snow... What a nice theory.\"There is a contradiction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The tracks to the river were covered by snow... What a nice theory.\"Edgeworth:\nThe tracks to the river were covered by snow... What a nice theory. However, Ms. von Karma... That is impossible.von Karma:\n... Would you care to explain... ...why there is a rude index finger currently pointed in my general direction?Edgeworth:\n...No need. The evidence will do all of the talking for me.Judge:\nOn the night of the murder the killer went to, and returned from, Dusky Bridge... ...in order to dispose of the murder weapon. The outgoing tracks were erased by snow. ...Or so claims Ms. von Karma. Mr. Edgeworth! Present your evidence to the contrary, eh! Evidence that the outgoing tracks were not covered by snow!Present Weather Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWitness! Please tell us again what time it was when you witnessed the crime.\nBikini:\nLike I said! It was around 11.\nEdgeworth:\n...Of course, this means that the weapon was thrown away after that time, correct? On that note... Please take a look at this data. It is the weather report for Eagle Mountain on the night of the murder.\nJudge:\nThe... weather report...?\nEdgeworth:\nSnow started to fall at 7 PM... But it stopped at around 10:50.\nvon Karma:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nTherefore! When the Sister witnessed the crime at 11 PM... ...the snow had already stopped falling! It is impossible for any tracks made after that time to have been covered up!\nvon Karma:\nAaah!\nJudge:\nO-Order! Order!\nJudge:\nVery well then... It looks like Ms. von Karma's claim has been... snowed in. Waaaaaah!\nvon Karma:\n...It's too soon to be closing this trial due to snow! Miles Edgeworth! How pathetic of you to rely on the weather of all things!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nvon Karma:\nAnswer me this, then! When is a weather report ever correct!?\nJudge:\nAh, no, no no... You've got it all wrong. This isn't a forecast... This is... actual data... Gyaaaaah!\nvon Karma:\nForecast, data, all weather reports have some inaccuracies! It may have still been snowing in the vicinity well past 11 PM!\nJudge:\nHmmmm... It's true. We cannot be totally sure, eh!\nEdgeworth:\nW-What!? (How did she pull that off!?)\nJudge:\n\"It had stopped snowing at Hazakura Temple when the murder took place.\" ...You need to provide conclusive evidence of this.\nEdgeworth:\n(I've come this far... There's no turning back now.) ...Very well. I, too, cannot allow any doubt to remain concerning this testimony.\nvon Karma:\nHah... You can't back down, can you? Such a perfectionist, Miles Edgeworth!\nJudge:\nVery well then... Mr. Edgeworth! Where is your evidence that it had already stopped snowing when the victim was killed!?\n\n\n\nPresent Crime Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ultimately, it all comes down to one point.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nJudge:\n... Your response, Ms. von Karma?\nvon Karma:\nIt looks like... It is still snowing in your heart, too. Shivering in the cold, you are closing your eyes to the truth...\nEdgeworth:\n...!\nJudge:\nAnd to think you just arrived after a long, tiring flight from Germany. That was poetry. Pure poetry.\nEdgeworth:\n(This evidence is only going to freeze my case solid.)\nvon Karma:\nRespond! Miles Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nEven if it is snowing in my heart... At the time of the murder... it had already stopped snowing at Hazakura Temple!\nLeads back to:\n\"Very well then... Mr. Edgeworth!\"Present Crime Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ultimately, it all comes down to one point.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nHere is the evidence! What do you have to say, Your Honor...?\nJudge:\n... ...This reminds me of when I was a little hockey goon in training... When I was a child, I hoped for school to be canceled due to heavy snowfall. Perhaps, Mr. Edgeworth, it would've been better for you had court been snowed in. ...That's all this evidence says to me, in any case.\nEdgeworth:\n... Nothing else...?\nJudge:\nNothing else.\nvon Karma:\nOh dear... You seem to have missed, Miles Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nNngh...!\nEdgeworth:\n(According to the witness's testimony, the incident occurred after 11 PM... In which case... ...there has to be evidence that can undeniably prove something doesn't match up!)\nLeads back to:\n\"On the night of the murder the killer went to, and returned from, Dusky Bridge...\"Edgeworth:\nUltimately, it all comes down to one point. That being... Whether or not it was snowing in that courtyard when the victim was stabbed...von Karma:\nThat's right. But proving that is...Edgeworth:\nIncredibly easy.von Karma:\n...!Edgeworth:\nIf we want to know whether it was snowing or not, this photo will tell us everything. Of course, I am referring to the photo of the crime scene. As you can see... everything is covered with snow. ...With just one exception.von Karma:\nAnd that is...?Edgeworth:\nThe victim herself, Ms. Elise Deauxnim! Why is there no snow on top of her...? The answer is simple! It had stopped snowing when she was killed, that's why!von Karma:\nGnnngh!Edgeworth:\nIn other words! If the killer really did go to the Eagle River to dispose of the murder weapon... ...then in this photograph, there should be two sets of tracks!von Karma:\nAaaaah!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Just what are you... Gyahaah!von Karma:\nJ-Just what are you suggesting, Miles Edgeworth!?Edgeworth:\n(To be honest... I am not entirely sure myself. But...) This is simply what all of the facts point to. That night... someone used the snowmobile to leave Hazakura Temple. From the tracks left, it can be understood that they were heading for Dusky Bridge. At that time... it was still snowing.von Karma:\nOf course it was. Because those tracks were erased by the snow. (Changed from [Of course it was. Because those tracks were gone.] in the original release)Edgeworth:\nThen when this person returned to Hazakura Temple... ...the snow had stopped. Thus, the return tracks remained.Judge:\nHmmmmm...Bikini:\nCan I say something? This all sounds a bit fishy to me...von Karma:\n...What does, Sister?Bikini:\nThere is only one key for the snowmobile.Edgeworth:\n...!von Karma:\nFurthermore, on the night in question, we know that the defendant had it! The key was found in her room after the murder!Bikini:\n...Which can only mean, that night... Iris used the snowmobile to go to the Inner Temple...Edgeworth:\n(But... Iris said that she never went there... I should probably press on this point some more when I get the chance...)Bikini:\nThe snowmobile can't cross the suspension bridge... So, she must have left it on the Hazakura side of the bridge and crossed on foot.Judge:\n...That sounds right.Bikini:\nBut... What's odd is, when I left Iris and returned to Hazakura Temple... I didn't see anything near Dusky Bridge.von Karma:\nY-You must have just failed to see it, Sister.Bikini:\nMaybe... But when I made it back to Hazakura Temple... ...it was there, by the Main Gate... The snowmobile, I mean. I know what I saw. It was covered in snow, too...Edgeworth:\nB-But that... isn't possible!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order in the court! ...What does this all mean?von Karma:\n...Nngh...Edgeworth:\nSo then what was the snowmobile used for...? It wasn't taken by the defendant when she went to the Inner Temple. If it had been, then the witness couldn't possibly have seen it by the gate. Furthermore... it wasn't used by the killer to dispose of the murder weapon. If that was the case, there should be two sets of tracks in this photo. All we know is this... After it stopped snowing... someone used the snowmobile to return to Hazakura Temple!Judge:\nHmmmmmm...Edgeworth:\n(I never thought a simple snowmobile could cause so much trouble...)Judge:\n... I think we've learned all we can from this witness... (Changed from [I think we've arrived at this point due to the witness...] in the original release)Bikini:\nYes, yes. I've nothing more to add. I've told you everything -- everything that I know.Judge:\nBut then... that still leaves us with the same problem. (Changed from [Well then... That still leaves us with the same problem.] in the original release) If only there was someone... A witness who could testify to having seen the snowmobile!Edgeworth:\n(A witness, huh...)Judge:\nWas there no one out, walking perhaps, near Dusky Bridge on that night?Bikini:\n... I don't think that's likely. It was cold enough to freeze your ears off. Only an idiot would go out wandering in that. ...Unless they had something really important to do.Judge:\nHmmmm... That's a shame.Edgeworth:\n(Hold on... Something is coming to me... An idiot may well have gone wandering out on that sub-arctic night!) ...Your Honor! Actually... there just might be one individual who may be of help to us. (Changed from [I actually have an idea... There may be one individual able to help us.] in the original release)Judge:\nR-Really!?von Karma:\n...You know of someone who might have seen the snowmobile on the night of the murder...?Edgeworth:\nI don't know for sure if he saw it or not... But there are two things about him that do come to mind.Judge:\nWhich are...?Edgeworth:\nFirst... that he saw \"something incredible\" on the night of the murder.von Karma:\n...And the second being?Edgeworth:\nThis individual that I am thinking of went wandering outside on that cold night... In other words, he is our kind of idiot.Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth! Who is this idiot you're talking aboot!?Present Larry Butz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This guy must be a product of \"Jean-Luc de Laduc's Guide To Obnoxious French Painting\"...\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nJudge:\nJust what is the meaning of this, Mr. Edgeworth...?

Aaah!\nvon Karma:\nYou're the wandering idiot, Miles Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nCool off before you try to take me on again! Ungh...! (What was I thinking!? This is the perfect chance to drag him onto the stand!)\nJudge:\nHmmmm... Mr. Edgeworth. This individual...

The student of the victim, Elise Deauxnim.Judge:\nHer student...? Interesting. Why was he wandering on the night of the murder?Edgeworth:\nT-That's... (I could tell them all about his designs for Iris... But it may cost us his credibility as a witness... Before I even call him.) He is, after all, an artist. He was, perhaps, searching for something in the snowy scenery that would move him. ...Although I cannot guarantee that this is the reason.von Karma:\nAnd so...? This unfortunate, unreliable-looking man... What exactly was it that he saw?Edgeworth:\nI intend to extract that from him, right here in this courtroom.Judge:\nSummon this youth as a witness immediately!von Karma:\n... I have no choice, do I?Edgeworth:\nI believe he is in the gallery for this trial. It will not take long to summon him.Judge:\n...Very well.Edgeworth:\n(Larry... You may have escaped me yesterday... But today I'm going to get everything out of you!)Judge:\n...The court will now adjourn for a 20 minute break.

We only have 20 minutes. There are two things which I need to ask you before we reconvene.Iris:\n...Alright. I'll help you any way I can.Edgeworth:\nFirst, about that night. You really didn't go to the Inner Temple, correct? The last witness claims to have met and talked with you in the Training Hall. Either you or Sister Bikini... ...is lying.Iris:\n... Mr. Edgeworth. It is just as I said yesterday. Until the incident occurred... I was in my own room, in Hazakura Temple.Edgeworth:\n...Very well. The second thing, then. That night, the temple snowmobile was used in between the time Sister Bikini... ...returned to the Main Hall and when she bore witness to the murder. Sometime between 10:30 and 11 PM that night. Were you the one who used the snowmobile?Iris:\n... There is only one key for the snowmobile. The only person who could have used it... was me.Edgeworth:\nSo it was you...! But... why? ...What made you go out to Dusky Bridge?Iris:\n... I'm sorry, Mr. Edgeworth.5 PSYCHE-LOCKSEdgeworth:\nIris...Iris:\nI can't... tell you about that... yet.Edgeworth:\n\"Yet\"...?Iris:\nNot until her safety is confirmed...Edgeworth:\nHer?Iris:\nThe safety of the acolyte...Edgeworth:\n(The \"acolyte\", huh... She's must be talking about Maya...) ... Iris. Look me in the eye and tell me the truth. Did you kill Elise Deauxnim?Iris:\n... No matter who or what may come... I could never take a life.Edgeworth:\n... (As I thought... no Psycholocks...) ...Very well. It is my job to get to the truth. You'll discover this for yourself soon enough.February 9, 11:36 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 7Judge:\n...Court will now reconvene. Ms. von Karma. Where is the witness...?von Karma:\nDuring the break, a man was detained for suspicious behavior in the gallery.Edgeworth:\nSuspicious behavior...?von Karma:\nHe was sketching something... Very intensely.Judge:\nDare I ask what the witness was sketching when he was detained?von Karma:\nHe drew a terrifying woman, armed with a demonic face and a vicious whip.Judge:\n... I can only presume that his intention was to capture you-- ...Aaaah!von Karma:\nAnyway, it's time to drag this pathetic excuse for an artist before the court! Laurice Deauxnim! I hope you're ready... Get in here!Edgeworth:\n(It would seem that whip is going to see plenty more use today...)Butz:\nOuch!von Karma:\n...Your sketch is in contempt of this court!Butz:\nH-Hey! I was just artistically rendering... Ou-Ouch!von Karma:\nYou tried to run away from the bailiff who was trying to hand you your subpoena, correct?Butz:\nL-Look! I'm nothing but a fledgling artist, training out in the mountains! I'm only down here in the city because I ran out of green paint. Well, to use the technical term for the color, \"viridian\".Edgeworth:\n...Larry... This isn't an art store, now is it...?Butz:\nI know! I graduated junior high, OK!? Look. Art is all about working in the fields, isn't it?Judge:\nWorking in the fields...?Edgeworth:\nI presume he wanted to say \"field work\"... I hope.Butz:\nTh-That's it! Thanks, buddy!Edgeworth:\n(It's kind of sad that I was able to understand his mangled train wreck of a sentence...)Butz:\nI just happened to stop in here and found a wonderful new model!von Karma:\n...Butz:\nSo see!? I've got nothing to do with this trial! At all! I expect all of your faces to be red when you realize this mistake! Bright red! Or, to use the technical term, \"crimson lake\". ...Ou-Ou-Ouch! Ou-Ou-Ou-Ouch! Ouch!Judge:\nOu-Ou-Ou-Ouch! Ouch! Ou-Ouch!von Karma:\nStop your pathetic blabbing and testify like a man!Judge:\nRefrain from whipping me, Ms. von Karma!

Aren't I, Edgeyyyyy...!?Judge:\nWitness! Please refrain from talking directly to the lawyers during your testimony!Butz:\nI-I'm just a nobody! Nothing but a small, worthless man, aren't I!? And why wasn't I asked for my name and occupation... or anything else...!?Judge:\n... Mr. Edgeworth. This man seems to have quite a severe inferiority complex.Edgeworth:\n...He's recently been the cause of numerous incidents. I think he's finally realized for himself... ...just how much of a nuisance he has been to other people!Butz:\nYeah, that's right! I'm behind everything, every case! Watch out, OK! Just touching me will make you eternally unhappy!Judge:\n...Well then, let us proceed with the cross-examination. With no touching, thank you. We can delve into other details at a later time.Cross Examination-- What I Saw --Butz:\nI was at that lodge out in the mountains, looking up at the stars that night.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...\nJudge:\nWhat ever is the matter, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nThis one single statement is so full of contradictions... For a moment there, I thought I was going to collapse.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nvon Karma:\nSo, witness? Any idea as to where these contradictions in your testimony lie? Depending on your answer... I may let my whip have its way.\nButz:\nOK, give me a minute... Well, it was snowing that night so I couldn't possibly have seen the stars. That run-down shack is hardly a \"lodge\", is it...? And even if the stars could be seen, it isn't like I was there to look at them, right?\nEdgeworth:\n...\nvon Karma:\nSee? You can do it if you try.\nButz:\nHeh heh heh... Ou-Ou-Ou-Ouch!\nvon Karma:\n...There is only one issue here. What you saw at Dusky Bridge.Butz:\nI walked to the bridge a number of times, but...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n\"A number of times\"...? How many?\nButz:\nMaybe... five times? I went once every twenty minutes.\nEdgeworth:\nWhich means... ...you spent almost two hours at Heavenly Hall that night?\nButz:\nYou bet! Real love is about waiting with your heart in your hands!\nJudge:\nLove, you say...?\nEdgeworth:\nIt was this man's intention to summon the defendant to the small shack. ...Using this blackmail letter.\nJudge:\nB-Blackmail...!?\nButz:\nNo, no! That was simply a product of overflowing love... A-Agh!\nvon Karma:\nYou huffy, puffy, loosey-goosey excuse for a whimpering whining wuss of a witness!\nJudge:\nSo... what did you see? I hope for your sake you saw a snowmobile... You huffy, puffy, loosey-goosey excuse for a whimpering whining wuss of a witness, eh!\nButz:\nUm... well... You see...\nEdgeworth:\n(Being called those names doesn't seem to bother him at all...)Butz:\nI didn't see a s-snowmobile!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Larry! You really didn't see it?\nButz:\nH-H-Hey! No need to hit your desk! I can hear you! ...I didn't see it! I didn't see a s-s-snowmobile!\nEdgeworth:\n... Larry. Say \"snowmobile\" for me, please?\nButz:\nS-S-S-Snowmobile.\nEdgeworth:\nIf you truly have nothing to hide... ...then why are you stammering like you just flew over a cuckoo's nest!?\nButz:\nSh-Shut up! W-W-What is this!? I don't know! Don't ask me!\nEdgeworth:\n(It seems that I'll need to start from a more obvious contradiction. I'm going to strike the blow that will finally get him to spill the beans!)Butz:\nI didn't see anyone at the bridge that night either! (Changed from [I didn't meet anyone at the bridge that night!] in the original release)Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou didn't meet anyone?\nButz:\nThat's right. Because I've got nothing to do with this! And I'm just here to buy some viridian paint, OK!? Come on, I expect to see those crimson lake faces! Now!\nJudge:\n... It would appear that simply pressing him isn't going to be enough, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\n...Indeed.Present Phoenix Wright profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Larry Butz...\"Edgeworth:\n(It seems that he's going to claim to have nothing to do with this to the end. I don't want this guy to cost us any more time... I need to slice through his obvious contradictions and keep things moving along...)Edgeworth:\nLarry Butz... I can understand why you might want to throw your old life away. You're pretty pathetic, and you cause all sorts of trouble...Butz:\nI'm sorry...!Edgeworth:\nBut... Having realized just how much of a nuisance you have been... ...that could be considered a step in the right direction.Butz:\nEdgey! Are you... trying to console me?Judge:\nIt certainly doesn't sound that way to me.Edgeworth:\nHowever... I cannot forgive you for simply turning away from the incidents you create!Butz:\nWaaah... You're totally pinning this on me...Edgeworth:\n...Now then. Let us talk about the night of the murder. Sister Bikini, after seeing the murder take place, asked Phoenix Wright to report it. Thus, he headed for the public phone by the bridge... There, he happened across a certain nefarious individual! You, Larry Butz!Butz:\n... That's right. Me, in the flesh.Judge:\nHmm... Listen carefully, witness. It doesn't matter if you change your name. So long as you remain pretty pathetic, you will continue to cause these incidents! That reality will not change!Butz:\nB-But...! What do you want me to do, then!?Edgeworth:\nLarry. What you need to change is your inner self. But for now... (Changed from [Larry. What you need to change is your inner self.] in the original release) \"What you saw that night\"... Testifying truthfully about this one issue is all I need from you. (Changed from [Testify truthfully! That is all you can do for now.] in the original release)Butz:\n... Edgey... I... I think... I've finally woken up! ... Well. I guess I could still be sleeping... But anyway! I'll do it! I'll testify! ... Well. I'm not sure this'll go especially well...Judge:\nI'll ask again, then, witness. What did you see on the night of the murder?Witness Testimony-- What I Saw, Pt. 2 --Butz:\nI went to the shack at around 9, so it would have been about 10:30 PM...\nI was lying under my bedding when a white flash almost blinded me!\nI looked out the window... and Dusky Bridge was on fire!\nThere was still some thunder, but I went right away to check it out.\nThat's when I ran into Nick.Judge:\nHmmmm... You certainly saw quite a lot, didn't you?von Karma:\nSo... what happened to the bridge after it caught on fire?Butz:\nIt was like me after a three-day stint chasing a girl... It totally burnt out. Like, almost totally gone. ...I mean, trying to cross the burning remains was what caused Nick to fall.von Karma:\nW-What did you say!?Edgeworth:\nOh, don't worry... It's nothing life-threatening. He just caught a cold. (Changed from [Oh, don't worry... nothing life-threatening. He just caught a cold.] in the original release)von Karma:\n...I never know with that man if he should be called lucky or unlucky... (Changed from [As always, hard to know if he should be called lucky or unlucky...] in the original release)Judge:\nNow, Mr. Edgeworth! Please commence your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- What I Saw, Pt. 2 --Butz:\nI went to the shack at around 9, so it would have been about 10:30 PM...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat did you do out there in the cold for an hour and a half?\nButz:\nWell, if you really must know... I was busy being excited. I guess.\nJudge:\nHmmmmm... \"Excited\"? Dare I even ask...?\nButz:\nI set the meeting time as 10:00 PM, right? But I couldn't wait. And I thought she might come early, too.\nEdgeworth:\n...Well, it appears she didn't come at all, in the end.\nvon Karma:\nBecause they never arranged to meet in the first place, did they?\nButz:\nShut up! Don't go picking my fond memories apart! Anyway, I was getting a little worried. I thought maybe Iris had lost her way. So every twenty minutes or so, I went out to the bridge. But I didn't see anything particularly suspicious... I didn't have anything else to do, so I went back to the shack to wait for her.Butz:\nI was lying under my bedding when a white flash almost blinded me!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis \"light\" was, of course...\nButz:\nLightning. Like... KERPOW! Like a slap from Naomi, honestly! A big bada-boom! Hagaaaaah!\nvon Karma:\n...Or a little like that?\nButz:\nWaaah! That's more like a punch from Miranda!\nJudge:\nWitness, did you actually see the lightning hit the bridge?\nButz:\nWell, I was a bit startled by the flash of light, so...Butz:\nI looked out the window... and Dusky Bridge was on fire!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nSeeing that, what did you do?\nButz:\nWhat do you think!? I was burning up as well! From the fire in my heart!\nvon Karma:\nAnd that's why you went to take a look at the bridge?\nButz:\nWell. To be honest... It was freezing cold, so at first I thought, \"Forget it. I'm not leaving my covers.\" But it had pretty much stopped snowing... So, I dunno, I changed my mind.\nJudge:\nHmmmmmm. I'm not sure I care for the \"forget it\" attitude you had at first, witness.Butz:\nThere was still some thunder, but I went right away to check it out.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou said \"right away\"... But exactly how long after the strike was that?\nButz:\nHmm... The lightning fell, and then the bridge caught on fire... Maybe around five minutes? I mean. I suddenly thought, \"Gotta go check this out!\"\nvon Karma:\nHow far is this small shack you were in from the bridge?\nButz:\nHold on... Well, it had pretty much stopped snowing... I guess about a five-minute walk?\nEdgeworth:\nAnd how did Dusky Bridge look when you got there?\nButz:\nLike I had recovered a piece of my childhood. I mean, not even the bonfires kids make during school camping trips can compare!\nEdgeworth:\n(...Well? Should I press him for a little more info?)\n\n\n\nNot right now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I don't think we can expect any more relevant information...

Let me ask you one thing.\nButz:\nWhat is it, Edgey? What's with the serious face?\nEdgeworth:\nWhy didn't you call anyone?\nButz:\nHuh? What do you mean? (Changed from [Eh? What do you mean?] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\nNormally... when faced with a \"towering inferno\", one would try and tell someone. There is a public phone right by Dusky Bridge, correct?\nButz:\n... Well, of course I thought of doing that.\nJudge:\nSo then... let's hear why you didn't!\nButz:\nH-Huh? Yeah, OK. A reason... My reason... It isn't that I didn't try to tell anyone... I just didn't have time to, OK?\nChanges statement from \"That's when I ran into Nick.\" or \"I thought I'd never get another chance to see something so big burning!\" to \"I arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later.\"\n\n\n\n\nWhy did you go to the bridge?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo you suddenly thought to \"check out\" the bridge...? Does this mean that you initially had no intention of doing so?\nButz:\nW-Well... Yeah, I guess it does... It was really cold... I didn't really want to go out there.\nEdgeworth:\nIf that's the case... Why did you change your mind? I would like to hear your reasoning.\nJudge:\nIn which case... please give testimony to that effect, witness!\nButz:\nM-My reasoning... OK... Reasoning, is it...?\nChanges statement from \"That's when I ran into Nick.\" or \"I arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later.\" to \"I thought I'd never get another chance to see something so big burning!\"Butz:\nThat's when I ran into Nick.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nHow did Phoenix Wright look when you met him?\nButz:\nHmm... He looked like a beaten up mule. He was dead tired. I mean, he had run all the way from Hazakura Temple. He simply stood, staring at me, breathing hard for a moment.\nvon Karma:\nHow far is it to Hazakura Temple from the bridge?\nButz:\nOn his legs... a 15 minute run, I'd say.\nJudge:\n...And that's when the murder was reported?\nButz:\nThat's right! And then he took a fall from the bridge!Butz:\nI arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou claim to have arrived at the bridge at the same time as Wright?\nButz:\nY-Yeah! I thought, \"I'd better tell someone about this.\" But then Nick came up yelling about murder! It totally made me forget about the bridge. The fire was pretty much out by then, anyway.\nEdgeworth:\n(What's this feeling...? I suddenly have a terrible case of unease...!)\nvon Karma:\nIt was after contacting the police that Phoenix Wright fell from the bridge, correct?\nButz:\nYeah. That's pretty much it. More or less.Present Weather Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Your very existence being a contradiction, I'm not sure if you can grasp this or not...\"Butz:\nI thought I'd never get another chance to see something so big burning!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...So you decided to go and see what was happening?\nButz:\nThat's right!

With my whip.Edgeworth:\n(...He told me about the burning bridge yesterday. But there's still something that doesn't quite fit... It looks like... ...despite his change of heart, Larry still isn't telling us the whole truth.)Edgeworth:\nYour very existence being a contradiction, I'm not sure if you can grasp this or not...Butz:\nWhat the hey, Edgey!? You make me sound like some sort of alien!Edgeworth:\nBut your testimony is conclusively contradictory. The problem here... is time.Butz:\nI've never been the best timekeeper, you know. \"Three minutes after Billy leaves on foot, you follow him on your bicycle. How long does it take for you to catch up with him?\" Terrible at those.Edgeworth:\n...This is much more simple. You saw the lightning strike Dusky Bridge... ...and immediately went to see what had happened. ...Is this correct?Butz:\nYeah... Well, I wasted about five minutes first, but more or less.Edgeworth:\n...I have the weather data from the night of the murder here. According to this, the lightning fell at 10:45 PM. You say it takes less than five minutes from the shack to Dusky Bridge. Meaning you probably got there at around 11 PM.Butz:\n...That all sounds about right, I guess. And then Nick showed up and did his falling act.Edgeworth:\nThat is impossible.von Karma:\n...What do you mean?Edgeworth:\n11 PM is when the murder occurred in Hazakura Temple. Thus... Wright was still there, in the courtyard. There is no way that Larry could have encountered him at Dusky Bridge at that time!von Karma:\n...!Butz:\nAh! Excuse me! I-I have an objection!Judge:\nYou do?Butz:\nEdgey! How many times do I have to say this!? I'm not Larry! I'm Laurice Deauxnim! Gyaaah!von Karma:\n...It has not been proven that the murder occurred at 11 PM. The Sister only said, \"around 11\". ...In which case! It could have been earlier than that!Edgeworth:\n...Watch your footing there, Ms. Franziska von Karma. The slope ahead is slippery! For there is still no way that Wright could have been at Dusky Bridge at 11 PM!von Karma:\nAnd why not!?Edgeworth:\nIt is clearly written here in the weather data report. It took around 30 minutes for the bridge to burn out. Therefore! The bridge must have been burning until at least 11:15 PM!Judge:\nWhich means... what, exactly?Edgeworth:\nWright did not see the bridge as it was burning that night. In fact, he did not arrive on the scene until after the flames had died down! (Changed from [He did not arrive there until after the flames had died down!] in the original release; extra space between [had] and [died] in the Trilogy release) ...Larry! You arrived at the bridge at 11 PM. But Wright did not make it there until at least 11:15... (Changed from [Wright did not make it there until at least 11:15...] in the original release) I suggest you to stop hiding things and just tell us the whole truth. Now, then... (Changed from [Are you still trying to hide something from us!?] in the original release) What happened during these missing 15 minutes!?Butz:\nUrk... I... I feel like I just got brutally woken up by toilet splashback... (Changed from [I... I feel like I just woke up...] in the original release) I guess I was still sleeping after all! Ha ha ha! Pinch me!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! Ordaaaaaaaaagh!von Karma:\n...So there was a missing 15 minutes prior to meeting Phoenix Wright. I hardly see that as much of a problem!Butz:\nYeah! Not much of a problem at all!Edgeworth:\nReally...? The bridge is burning before your eyes, and there is a phone right next to it. Why, then, did you not report the accident?Judge:\nYes, witness! Why didn't you!? Were you there simply to watch the bridge burn? (Changed from [Did you simply... watch the bridge burn?] in the original release)Edgeworth:\nAnd therein lies the problem. (Changed from [That is the problem here...] in the original release) For even after the bridge had burnt out, he was still there! (Changed from [Even after the bridge burnt out, he was still there!] in the original release) Staring into space, this witness didn't even attempt to fulfill his civic duty! (Changed from [He simply stood there and didn't report anything.] in the original release)von Karma:\nTh-That's what it sounds like...Edgeworth:\nAh, but this is Larry we are talking about, and even he is incapable of being so stupid. (Changed from [This might be Larry we are talking about, but even he is incapable of being so stupid.] in the original release) Which means there has to be a reason for his inaction!

Are you sure you want to hear it all!?Edgeworth:\nY-Yes...Butz:\nI may reeeeally say it this time! Everything! Kahaah!von Karma:\n...Then say it!Judge:\nVery well... I have a terribly bad feeling aboot this; however... ...let's have the witness finally give us the whole truth. Now... for this 15 minute gap, what where you doing, witness!?Witness Testimony-- The Missing 15 Minutes --Butz:\nI'm a Deauxnim. I'm an artist! What do you think I was doing?\nSketching!

You don't understand me at all! If I see an abandoned cat, I find myself passing by it with tears in my eyes! I am a man overflowing with irresponsible kindness! And I use my irresponsible kindness to fill the pages of my notebook!\nvon Karma:\nAn artist, using a notebook... It's so pathetic, it makes me want to cry myself. I command you to go buy at least a proper sketch pad!\nButz:\nW-W-What has that got to do with anything!?\nJudge:\nI'm not sure if I care for an artist using a notebook for sketching. Proceed, witness.Press (after adding statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou transfered everything \"directly onto the page\"...? And that is this sketch here?\nButz:\nYep! Sensational, isn't it? Or should that be scandalous? ...It put my mind at ease, anyway.\nvon Karma:\nIt did?\nButz:\nThat's right! The reason she didn't come to me, even though I waited for her... ...Was because she was trapped on the other side of the bridge!\nJudge:\n...\nButz:\nCould it be that Iris... ...undertook that dangerous, despereate flight in order to reach me...!? That's gotta be it! Alright! Go, me! Nice ooooooouch!\nvon Karma:\n...Continue.

Once I get caught up in something, I tend to forget everything else...\nEdgeworth:\n(That's true... He's always  been that way. I guess he's not lying about that, at least.)\nvon Karma:\nPhoenix Wright appeared on the scene after 11:15... If he was drawing until then, that dispels all doubts.\nJudge:\nAside from doubts of his humanity, eh...Edgeworth:\n(There is a big clue waiting for me in this cross-examination... This testimony does nothing less than mock the court... But I am sure that there is a vital kernel of truth hidden in it somewhere!)Edgeworth:\nLarry. What did you really see that night...? Not that I particularly care.Butz:\nIn your position, that's just being irresponsible! I... I drew exactly what I saw! I'll give you a whole dollar that it's the truth!Edgeworth:\nIf that is truly the case... Then there is one thing that we can say for certain.Judge:\nWhat might that be...?Edgeworth:\nThat the person who flew over the bridge... ...could not have been the defendant, Iris!Butz:\nW-W-What!? What do you mean? I don't understand!? Uwaaagh!von Karma:\nA foolhardy folly of a foolish statement by an equally foolishly foolhardy fool. How, exactly, can you make this claim?Edgeworth:\n...Tell us, Larry. According to this picture... ...the individual whom you say you saw was wearing a hood. Correct?Butz:\nOf course she was! That run-down shack is quite a way from the bridge... The hood is what told me that this floating angel was my Iris! The hood is my darling Iris! And Iris is my darling hood! Waaah!von Karma:\nIt seems there are bigger fools in this world than the one at the defense's bench.Edgeworth:\n...Larry, there's something you need to be made aware of. On the night of the murder... Iris wasn't wearing her hood. She had given it to Wright as a gift! Are you going to change your story now? Perhaps suggest it was Wright who took flight!?Butz:\nW-What are you talking about!?Edgeworth:\n...I think you understand what I mean just fine.Butz:\nWhy...? Why did Nick have Iris's hood!?Edgeworth:\nWhat...? (Changed from [Eh...?] in the original release)Butz:\nEdgey! What's going on with Iris and Nick!? Why you, Niiiiiick! You dooooooog!Judge:\nI do believe... ...that this unbelievably mysterious sketch... ...is destined to disappear, discredited and discarded. Straight into the garbage.Butz:\n...Hah... Hah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hagaaah!von Karma:\n...What is it now, witness?Butz:\nIt feels like... I've been waiting 25 years for this very day to come! Edgey! Today is the day I get to completely stupefy you!Edgeworth:\nW-What...!?Judge:\nWhat is the meaning of your outburst, witness!?Butz:\n...I hate to have to do this, but I have some definitive evidence.Edgeworth:\n\"Definitive\"...?von Karma:\n\"Evidence\"...?Butz:\nIris did indeed come flying over the burning bridge! And I, Laurice Deauxnim... ...shall prove it!Judge:\nI didn't expect to ask this again... But we shall be needing your testimony once again. Tell us anything you know concerning the defendant as depicted in this sketch... And show us your evidence that this nightmare was actually a reality!Butz:\n...OK. I hope you're ready, Edgey! Because I'm going to feed you a whopping serving of pain!Edgeworth:\n(...You've been serving us a whopping serving of pain this whole time. Trust me.)Witness Testimony-- Proof That Iris Flew! --Butz:\nWhen I reached Dusky Bridge she was already gone...\nI was so worried! So I frantically searched all over for her!\nThat led to me finding a beautiful crystal sphere, half-buried in the snow!\nI'm sure that Iris was simply wearing a spare hood.\nAfter all, no one else could have lost a crystal sphere that night.Judge:\nA c-crystal sphere...!?Butz:\nThis one. Pretty, isn't it? But finders keepers!von Karma:\nThat sphere... Where did you find it?Butz:\nLet me see... Around here, somewhere? Looks about right.Edgeworth:\nAnd it was half-buried in the snow...?Butz:\nIt had pretty much stopped snowing by then... But there was still some falling as I walked to the bridge.Judge:\nHmmmm... The court accepts this crystal sphere!Butz:\n...That's mine, OK!? I want it back afterward!Judge:\nHmm... There's something on it... (Changed from [There's something on it, isn't there...] in the original release)von Karma:\n...?Judge:\nOh my... It's blood! (Changed from [Oh my... It's a blood stain!] in the original release)Edgeworth:\n(What!? Blood...!?) (Changed from [What!? A blood stain...!?] in the original release)Crystal Sphere added to the Court Record.Butz:\nYou ready, Edgey!? By tomorrow morning, you'll be calling me \"Master Larry\"! Yeah, I like the sound of that! No one's going to push me around anymore!Edgeworth:\n(...Didn't you want to be called \"Laurice Deauxnim\" only a few minutes ago!?)Cross Examination",

What did you really see that night...?\"Butz:\nThe shock and awe that I was feeling... I transferred it all directly onto the page!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe burning bridge moved you that much, did it? ...I find that hard to believe.\nButz:\nYou moron, Edgey! You don't understand me at all! If I see an abandoned cat, I find myself passing by it with tears in my eyes! I am a man overflowing with irresponsible kindness! And I use my irresponsible kindness to fill the pages of my notebook!\nvon Karma:\nAn artist, using a notebook... It's so pathetic, it makes me want to cry myself. I command you to go buy at least a proper sketch pad!\nButz:\nW-W-What has that got to do with anything!?\nJudge:\nI'm not sure if I care for an artist using a notebook for sketching. Proceed, witness.Press (after adding statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou transfered everything \"directly onto the page\"...? And that is this sketch here?\nButz:\nYep! Sensational, isn't it? Or should that be scandalous? ...It put my mind at ease, anyway.\nvon Karma:\nIt did?\nButz:\nThat's right! The reason she didn't come to me, even though I waited for her... ...Was because she was trapped on the other side of the bridge!\nJudge:\n...\nButz:\nCould it be that Iris... ...undertook that dangerous, despereate flight in order to reach me...!? That's gotta be it! Alright! Go, me! Nice ooooooouch!\nvon Karma:\n...Continue. Please.Butz:\n...Before I realized it, the flames had gone out and then he came running up.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou forgot the passage of time to that extent, did you?\nButz:\nWell... Once I get caught up in something, I tend to forget everything else...\nEdgeworth:\n(That's true... He's always  been that way. I guess he's not lying about that, at least.)\nvon Karma:\nPhoenix Wright appeared on the scene after 11:15... If he was drawing until then, that dispels all doubts.\nJudge:\nAside from doubts of his humanity, eh...Edgeworth:\n(There is a big clue waiting for me in this cross-examination... This testimony does nothing less than mock the court... But I am sure that there is a vital kernel of truth hidden in it somewhere!)Edgeworth:\nLarry. What did you really see that night...? Not that I particularly care.Butz:\nIn your position, that's just being irresponsible! I... I drew exactly what I saw! I'll give you a whole dollar that it's the truth!Edgeworth:\nIf that is truly the case... Then there is one thing that we can say for certain.Judge:\nWhat might that be...?Edgeworth:\nThat the person who flew over the bridge... ...could not have been the defendant, Iris!Butz:\nW-W-What!? What do you mean? I don't understand!? Uwaaagh!von Karma:\nA foolhardy folly of a foolish statement by an equally foolishly foolhardy fool. How, exactly, can you make this claim?Edgeworth:\n...Tell us, Larry. According to this picture... ...the individual whom you say you saw was wearing a hood. Correct?Butz:\nOf course she was! That run-down shack is quite a way from the bridge... The hood is what told me that this floating angel was my Iris! The hood is my darling Iris! And Iris is my darling hood! Waaah!von Karma:\nIt seems there are bigger fools in this world than the one at the defense's bench.Edgeworth:\n...Larry, there's something you need to be made aware of. On the night of the murder... Iris wasn't wearing her hood. She had given it to Wright as a gift! Are you going to change your story now? Perhaps suggest it was Wright who took flight!?Butz:\nW-What are you talking about!?Edgeworth:\n...I think you understand what I mean just fine.Butz:\nWhy...? Why did Nick have Iris's hood!?Edgeworth:\nWhat...? (Changed from [Eh...?] in the original release)Butz:\nEdgey! What's going on with Iris and Nick!? Why you, Niiiiiick! You dooooooog!Judge:\nI do believe... ...that this unbelievably mysterious sketch... ...is destined to disappear, discredited and discarded. Straight into the garbage.Butz:\n...Hah... Hah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hagaaah!von Karma:\n...What is it now, witness?Butz:\nIt feels like... I've been waiting 25 years for this very day to come! Edgey! Today is the day I get to completely stupefy you!Edgeworth:\nW-What...!?Judge:\nWhat is the meaning of your outburst, witness!?Butz:\n...I hate to have to do this, but I have some definitive evidence.Edgeworth:\n\"Definitive\"...?von Karma:\n\"Evidence\"...?Butz:\nIris did indeed come flying over the burning bridge! And I, Laurice Deauxnim... ...shall prove it!Judge:\nI didn't expect to ask this again... But we shall be needing your testimony once again. Tell us anything you know concerning the defendant as depicted in this sketch... And show us your evidence that this nightmare was actually a reality!Butz:\n...OK. I hope you're ready, Edgey! Because I'm going to feed you a whopping serving of pain!Edgeworth:\n(...You've been serving us a whopping serving of pain this whole time. Trust me.)Witness Testimony-- Proof That Iris Flew! --Butz:\nWhen I reached Dusky Bridge she was already gone...\nI was so worried! So I frantically searched all over for her!\nThat led to me finding a beautiful crystal sphere, half-buried in the snow!\nI'm sure that Iris was simply wearing a spare hood.\nAfter all, no one else could have lost a crystal sphere that night.Judge:\nA c-crystal sphere...!?Butz:\nThis one. Pretty, isn't it? But finders keepers!von Karma:\nThat sphere... Where did you find it?Butz:\nLet me see... Around here, somewhere? Looks about right.Edgeworth:\nAnd it was half-buried in the snow...?Butz:\nIt had pretty much stopped snowing by then... But there was still some falling as I walked to the bridge.Judge:\nHmmmm... The court accepts this crystal sphere!Butz:\n...That's mine, OK!? I want it back afterward!Judge:\nHmm... There's something on it... (Changed from [There's something on it, isn't there...] in the original release)von Karma:\n...?Judge:\nOh my... It's blood! (Changed from [Oh my... It's a blood stain!] in the original release)Edgeworth:\n(What!? Blood...!?) (Changed from [What!? A blood stain...!?] in the original release)Crystal Sphere added to the Court Record.Butz:\nYou ready, Edgey!? By tomorrow morning, you'll be calling me \"Master Larry\"! Yeah, I like the sound of that! No one's going to push me around anymore!Edgeworth:\n(...Didn't you want to be called \"Laurice Deauxnim\" only a few minutes ago!?)Cross Examination",

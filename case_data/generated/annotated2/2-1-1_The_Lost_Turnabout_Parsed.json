The one and only Phoenix Wright came to save the day! And just like that, I was moved to tears, sir! I'll never forget what you're doing for me, EVER!Phoenix:\n(What is this girl babbling about...?)Byrde: \nActually, I really love to watch court proceedings, and I always root for you to win! When I'm off duty, I like to come here and... ...? What's wrong? You've been acting really strange and you keep staring at me. You're making me kind of nervous, sir...Phoenix: \nOh... sorry. (Hmm... I'm afraid to ask, but here goes...) So, this might sound bad, but... uh... Who are you...?Byrde: \nWhaaaaat!? Mr. Wright!! How can you say that!? How can you do this to the fragile heart of a girl about to go on trial...? You're absolutely horrible!Phoenix: \nNo -- I mean, I didn't mean it like that!Byrde:\nIs this how a defense attorney treats his clients, sir!?

Tell me this is just a bad dream!(Why do I get the feeling this is one dream I won't be waking up from...? *gulp*)September 8, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Maggey Byrde.Payne:\nThe prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:\n...Judge:\nWhat is it, Mr. Wright?Phoenix: \nUm, er... Are you talking to me...?Judge: \nDo you see any other defense attorneys here?Phoenix: \n(I guess not.) (Changed from [I guess not. Urk.] in the original release)Judge: \nNow then, are you ready?Yes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I should say, \"Yes\" for now.)\nJudge: \nAre you ready, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix: \nYes, Your Honor. (... Wait a sec... If her life is in my hands... I should really do the responsible thing...)\nLeads to:\n\"Actually, you see, Your Honor... My memory is kind of...\"No\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... What if I said, \"No\"? Would that be alright?\nJudge:\nOf course it wouldn't!\nPhoenix:\n(Then why bother asking to begin with??)\nLeads to:\n\"Actually, you see, Your Honor... My memory is kind of...\"Phoenix:\nActually, you see, Your Honor... My memory is kind of...Judge:\nThe court will not hear the defense's excuses. Because the defendant is a member of the police, this case is under great scrutiny. Therefore, we must make this trial fair but swift. I believe I have told you this before. I hope you're not telling me you've forgotten!Phoenix:\n(Actually, I have...) (Changed from [Actually, I did...] in the original release)Judge:\nMr. Payne, your opening statement, please.Payne:\nYes, Your Honor. As I'm sure you're well aware, the defendant is accused of killing her lover. What's worse, her lover was a fellow police officer!Phoenix:\nA policeman? You did WHAT to a policeman!?Byrde:\nIt wasn't me! And besides, Dustin and I... We weren't \"lovers\" like that!Payne:\nIn any case... The prosecution will prove that the guilty party is none other than the defendant!Judge:\nVery well. Mr. Payne, please call your first witness.Payne:\nHee, hee, hee. It's been a while, Mr. Wright. Let's see what you've learned since last time. I won't show you any mercy this time, rookie!Phoenix:\nOkaaay... (And who are you again!?)Payne:\nThe prosecution calls Detective Dick Gumshoe to the stand. (Changed from [Please bring Detective Dick Gumshoe to the stand.] in the original release)Byrde:\nHere we go! Don't let me down, Mr. Wright!Phoenix:\n(Nowhere to hide... I'm sooo dead...)Payne:\nWitness, please state your name and occupation.Gumshoe:\nMy name is Dick Gumshoe, sir. I'm the detective in charge of homicides down at the precinct, sir.Judge:\nYou don't look very well, Detective.Gumshoe:\nWell, sir, the defendant... She works under me, so, you know...Phoenix:\nYou work under that detective?Byrde:\nYes, sir! And while I was a trainee, he was always watching out for me, sir! He's such a wonderful guy, sir! I'll never forget what he's done for me!Phoenix:\n(OK, calm down, I believe you.)Payne:\nDetective Gumshoe. Please describe for us the details of this murder.Gumshoe:\nYes, sir. It happened at the park near headquarters, \"Expos√© Park\". The victim was one of the local cops, Dustin Prince. He was pushed down from the benches on the upper path, sir. The landing beat his body up bad and snapped his neck.Payne:\nThe details are listed in the report that was distributed yesterday...Judge:\nAh, yes. This autopsy report, correct?Phoenix:\n(Why do I not remember getting a copy...?)Judge:\nI see everything is in order here. Even the estimated time of death is unusually well documented!Gumshoe:\nThe victim's watch stopped from the impact of the landing, sir. The results of the autopsy confirmed the time of death.Payne:\nIf I may, Your Honor, the prosecution would like to submit this photograph.Judge:\nVery well. The court accepts it into evidence.Crime Photo 1 added to the Court Record.Judge:\nNow then, I recall at yesterday's preliminary hearing, a very important piece of evidence was brought to our attention.Payne:\nYes, Your Honor.Gumshoe:\nYes, sir.Phoenix:\nYes... I guess?Judge:\nMr. Wright! Is your head on right today!? There was a very crucial piece of evidence found under the victim's body!Phoenix:\nUm, was there?Byrde:\nHave you lost your mind!?Phoenix:\nWell, actually... Um, it's just nerves. Give me a second.Byrde:\nWhaaaat!? How can you talk like such an amateur!? I thought you were a pro, sir! ... Alright, sir. I'll help you through this! At a time like this, maybe you ought to take a glance at the Court Record!Phoenix:\n...Court Record?Byrde:\nYup! Info about evidence and people involved with this case are all listed there, sir! You can look a the Court Record by pressing [the R Button / Tab]! (Changed from [You can look at the Court Record by touching the Court Record Button!] in the original release)Phoenix:\n[The R Button / Tab], huh... You really know what you're talking about, don't you? (Changed from [The Court Record Button...? You really know what you're talking about, huh?] in the original release)Byrde:\nIt's too bad I'm a cop, right? Just think! I could totally be a legal aide instead!Judge:\nMr. Wright.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor!Judge:\nCourt is in session. Save your chit-chat for later!Phoenix:\nS-Sorry, Your Honor... (Well, I guess I'd better check the Court Record, and see what I can find... What was it again? [The R Button / Tab]...? (Changed from [What was it again? The Court Record Button...?] in the original release))Judge:\nAlright, Mr. Wright. Let's see if your notes are in order. What was the piece of evidence found underneath the victim's body?A wallet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... I'm pretty sure it was a wallet...\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nThis is a court of law! You can't just make wild guesses!\nJudge:\nAgreed.\nByrde:\nThey're right, Mr. Wright! You have to check the Court Record before you answer! If you don't, your client might end up with a guilty verdict!\nPhoenix:\n(\"Your client\"? You do realize that's you, right?)\nJudge:\nI will ask you one more time.\nLeads back to:\n\"What was the piece of evidence found underneath the victim's body?\"Glasses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"That's simple, Your Honor. A broken pair of glasses.\"A police badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIf he's a cop, then I guess maybe a badge or something...\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nMr. Wright! Please stick to the facts of this case!\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe is a policeman, correct?\nPayne:\nI don't think you understand the problem here.\nJudge:\nI will not have an uninformed lawyer in my court.\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. (Guess there's no fooling those two.)\nByrde:\nPlease, for my sake, look at the Court Record, sir!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh, with [the R Button / Tab], right?) (Changed from [Uh, it's the Court Record Button, right?] in the original release)\nJudge:\nI will ask you one more time.\nLeads back to:\n\"What was the piece of evidence found underneath the victim's body?\"Phoenix:\nThat's simple, Your Honor. A broken pair of glasses.Judge:\nThat's right.Gumshoe:\nThe victim grabbed the criminal's glasses as he was being shoved, sir, and held onto them as he fell.Phoenix:\n...Byrde:\nHey! Why are you giving me the evil eye!?Phoenix:\nThose glasses you're wearing...Byrde:\nNnnngh... Yes, this is my spare pair. But these glasses they found at the scene of the crime are not mine! I swear, sir!Phoenix:\nYou sure about that?Byrde:\nLook, it was a coincidence that on that same day, I accidentally stepped on mine!Phoenix:\n(A \"coincidence\" she says... Urk...)Payne:\nEh hee hee hee hee hee hee! Your Honor. I have further evidence to present.Judge:\nOh? You have more?Payne:\nAnd this evidence is very decisive.Judge:\nVery well! Let's hear from our witness about this \"evidence\".Witness Testimony-- Decisive Evidence --Gumshoe:\nThere's something even more incriminating than the glasses under the victim's body, sir.\nDuring his date, the victim was pushed from the bench area.\nBut he managed to write the culprit's name on the ground where he landed.\nI don't like saying it, but it was clearly the defendant's name, \"Maggie\", sir.\nWith this piece of evidence and the glasses, it's hard to say she's not the culprit.Payne:\nThis is a picture of the writing, Your Honor.Judge:\nWhy, this is...! Yes, I can see the name is clearly written here.Payne:\nThe prosecution would like to submit this picture.Judge:\nUnderstood. The court accepts it into evidence.Crime Photo 2 added to the Court Record.Phoenix:\nAs if the glasses alone didn't make you look suspicious, the victim even wrote your name clear as day on the ground!Byrde:\nBut, but, but, I already told you! Those glasses aren't mine!!Phoenix:\nAnd how do you explain his dying message?Byrde:\n... It's a conspiracy! I'm not guilty, sir!Judge:\nMr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Phoenix:\nCross-examine?Byrde:\nThis is it! I'm counting on you!Phoenix:\nSure... But what am I supposed to do?Byrde:\nWHAT!? This isn't like you at all! Normally, this is the part where you get in the witnesses' faces!Phoenix:\nGet in their faces and do what?Byrde:\nI guess there's no way around it! OK, I'm going to lend you a hand! The prosecution's witnesses all hide things from the court, which means they lie from time to time.Phoenix:\nLie? But... isn't that detective your superior?Byrde:\nWell, even if they don't mean to lie, sometimes people just remember things wrong.Phoenix:\nHmm, like that detective. He does sort of look like a scatterbrain...Byrde:\nIt doesn't matter! Either way, it's bad for us, sir! That's why when you question witnesses, you have to find and expose their lies!Judge:\nMr. Wright. Your cross-examination, please.Phoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor. (Talk about trial by fire. Here goes nothing. As long as I can \"expose the lies\", we should be alright.)Cross Examination",

You can't run forever, Mr. Phoenix Wright!Phoenix:\nWha...!? What have I done wrong!?I cannot allow you to go on like this!Phoenix:\n...? B-But I'm just a simple defense attorney!Silence! You are no longer worthy of your title.September 8, 9:08 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Phoenix:\nWhat a nightmare... And I bet it was this ringtone that caused it... I really shouldn't be dozing off right before a trial starts anyway...Phone:\n...*beep*...Phoenix: \nHuh... looks like they hung up.???:\nAh, good. I finally found it. Talk about a close call. I hate to do this to you, but... It's nothing personal... Mr. Attorney.A few minutes later...District CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Phoenix:\n... Ouch... My head... It's throbbing... And why does it feel... so foggy in there...????: \nGooood morning!Phoenix: \nAck! Uh... G-Good morning...???: \nWhat's wrong!? You don't look well! People are at their best first thing in the morning! Where's that fighting spirit!?Phoenix: \n... Sorry, but can you please turn the cheeriness down? My head... sort of hurts...???: \nRoger that!Phoenix: \n...???: \n...Phoenix: \n... Um... Am I in trouble or something????: \nHuh? \"Trouble...?\"Phoenix: \nW-Wait, never mind. You're a policewoman, right? I thought maybe I had done something wrong...????: \nWh-What are you talking about? I'm the one in trouble!Phoenix: \n... What?Byrde: \nI'm placing my life in your hands today, Mr. Phoenix Wright!Phoenix: \nLife... in... my hands...?Byrde: \nYou promised me! You said you would prove that I was not guilty!Phoenix: \n\"N... Not... guilty\"?Byrde: \nJust when I thought all hope was lost; when all the other lawyers had laughed me off... \"Leave it to me!\" you said! You! The one and only Phoenix Wright came to save the day! And just like that, I was moved to tears, sir! I'll never forget what you're doing for me, EVER!Phoenix:\n(What is this girl babbling about...?)Byrde: \nActually, I really love to watch court proceedings, and I always root for you to win! When I'm off duty, I like to come here and... ...? What's wrong? You've been acting really strange and you keep staring at me. You're making me kind of nervous, sir...Phoenix: \nOh... sorry. (Hmm... I'm afraid to ask, but here goes...) So, this might sound bad, but... uh... Who are you...?Byrde: \nWhaaaaat!? Mr. Wright!! How can you say that!? How can you do this to the fragile heart of a girl about to go on trial...? You're absolutely horrible!Phoenix: \nNo -- I mean, I didn't mean it like that!Byrde:\nIs this how a defense attorney treats his clients, sir!? I can't believe this!!Phoenix:\nNo, it's just... ...Well, I think you have the wrong person. I'm...Byrde:\nYes...!? \"I'm...\"!?Phoenix: \n... ... I'm... Who am I? (Why am I drawing a blank...?)Bailiff:\nThe trial will begin shortly. Will the defendant and her lawyer please proceed to the courtroom immediately!Byrde: \nThe trial's about to start! I'm counting on you in there, OK?Phoenix: \n(Hmm... I guess I must have amnesia... Let's see... What can I piece together...? Hmm, from our conversation, I can safely say that I'm probably a defense attorney. And that girl... I said I'd prove her \"not guilty\"... I can't believe I made such an irresponsible promise.) Aaaaaargh! Someone, please!! Tell me this is just a bad dream!(Why do I get the feeling this is one dream I won't be waking up from...? *gulp*)September 8, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Maggey Byrde.Payne:\nThe prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:\n...Judge:\nWhat is it, Mr. Wright?Phoenix: \nUm, er... Are you talking to me...?Judge: \nDo you see any other defense attorneys here?Phoenix: \n(I guess not.) (Changed from [I guess not. Urk.] in the original release)Judge: \nNow then, are you ready?Yes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I should say, \"Yes\" for now.)\nJudge: \nAre you ready, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix: \nYes, Your Honor. (... Wait a sec... If her life is in my hands... I should really do the responsible thing...)\nLeads to:\n\"Actually, you see, Your Honor... My memory is kind of...\"No\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... What if I said, \"No\"? Would that be alright?\nJudge:\nOf course it wouldn't!\nPhoenix:\n(Then why bother asking to begin with??)\nLeads to:\n\"Actually, you see, Your Honor... My memory is kind of...\"Phoenix:\nActually, you see, Your Honor... My memory is kind of...Judge:\nThe court will not hear the defense's excuses. Because the defendant is a member of the police, this case is under great scrutiny. Therefore, we must make this trial fair but swift. I believe I have told you this before. I hope you're not telling me you've forgotten!Phoenix:\n(Actually, I have...) (Changed from [Actually, I did...] in the original release)Judge:\nMr. Payne, your opening statement, please.Payne:\nYes, Your Honor. As I'm sure you're well aware, the defendant is accused of killing her lover. What's worse, her lover was a fellow police officer!Phoenix:\nA policeman? You did WHAT to a policeman!?Byrde:\nIt wasn't me! And besides, Dustin and I... We weren't \"lovers\" like that!Payne:\nIn any case... The prosecution will prove that the guilty party is none other than the defendant!Judge:\nVery well. Mr. Payne, please call your first witness.Payne:\nHee, hee, hee. It's been a while, Mr. Wright. Let's see what you've learned since last time. I won't show you any mercy this time, rookie!Phoenix:\nOkaaay... (And who are you again!?)Payne:\nThe prosecution calls Detective Dick Gumshoe to the stand. (Changed from [Please bring Detective Dick Gumshoe to the stand.] in the original release)Byrde:\nHere we go! Don't let me down, Mr. Wright!Phoenix:\n(Nowhere to hide... I'm sooo dead...)Payne:\nWitness, please state your name and occupation.Gumshoe:\nMy name is Dick Gumshoe, sir. I'm the detective in charge of homicides down at the precinct, sir.Judge:\nYou don't look very well, Detective.Gumshoe:\nWell, sir, the defendant... She works under me, so, you know...Phoenix:\nYou work under that detective?Byrde:\nYes, sir! And while I was a trainee, he was always watching out for me, sir! He's such a wonderful guy, sir! I'll never forget what he's done for me!Phoenix:\n(OK, calm down, I believe you.)Payne:\nDetective Gumshoe. Please describe for us the details of this murder.Gumshoe:\nYes, sir. It happened at the park near headquarters, \"Expos√© Park\". The victim was one of the local cops, Dustin Prince. He was pushed down from the benches on the upper path, sir. The landing beat his body up bad and snapped his neck.Payne:\nThe details are listed in the report that was distributed yesterday...Judge:\nAh, yes. This autopsy report, correct?Phoenix:\n(Why do I not remember getting a copy...?)Judge:\nI see everything is in order here. Even the estimated time of death is unusually well documented!Gumshoe:\nThe victim's watch stopped from the impact of the landing, sir. The results of the autopsy confirmed the time of death.Payne:\nIf I may, Your Honor, the prosecution would like to submit this photograph.Judge:\nVery well. The court accepts it into evidence.Crime Photo 1 added to the Court Record.Judge:\nNow then, I recall at yesterday's preliminary hearing, a very important piece of evidence was brought to our attention.Payne:\nYes, Your Honor.Gumshoe:\nYes, sir.Phoenix:\nYes... I guess?Judge:\nMr. Wright! Is your head on right today!? There was a very crucial piece of evidence found under the victim's body!Phoenix:\nUm, was there?Byrde:\nHave you lost your mind!?Phoenix:\nWell, actually... Um, it's just nerves. Give me a second.Byrde:\nWhaaaat!? How can you talk like such an amateur!? I thought you were a pro, sir! ... Alright, sir. I'll help you through this! At a time like this, maybe you ought to take a glance at the Court Record!Phoenix:\n...Court Record?Byrde:\nYup! Info about evidence and people involved with this case are all listed there, sir! You can look a the Court Record by pressing [the R Button / Tab]! (Changed from [You can look at the Court Record by touching the Court Record Button!] in the original release)Phoenix:\n[The R Button / Tab], huh... You really know what you're talking about, don't you? (Changed from [The Court Record Button...? You really know what you're talking about, huh?] in the original release)Byrde:\nIt's too bad I'm a cop, right? Just think! I could totally be a legal aide instead!Judge:\nMr. Wright.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor!Judge:\nCourt is in session. Save your chit-chat for later!Phoenix:\nS-Sorry, Your Honor... (Well, I guess I'd better check the Court Record, and see what I can find... What was it again? [The R Button / Tab]...? (Changed from [What was it again? The Court Record Button...?] in the original release))Judge:\nAlright, Mr. Wright. Let's see if your notes are in order. What was the piece of evidence found underneath the victim's body?A wallet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... I'm pretty sure it was a wallet...\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nThis is a court of law! You can't just make wild guesses!\nJudge:\nAgreed.\nByrde:\nThey're right, Mr. Wright! You have to check the Court Record before you answer! If you don't, your client might end up with a guilty verdict!\nPhoenix:\n(\"Your client\"? You do realize that's you, right?)\nJudge:\nI will ask you one more time.\nLeads back to:\n\"What was the piece of evidence found underneath the victim's body?\"Glasses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"That's simple, Your Honor. A broken pair of glasses.\"A police badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIf he's a cop, then I guess maybe a badge or something...\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nMr. Wright! Please stick to the facts of this case!\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe is a policeman, correct?\nPayne:\nI don't think you understand the problem here.\nJudge:\nI will not have an uninformed lawyer in my court.\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. (Guess there's no fooling those two.)\nByrde:\nPlease, for my sake, look at the Court Record, sir!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh, with [the R Button / Tab], right?) (Changed from [Uh, it's the Court Record Button, right?] in the original release)\nJudge:\nI will ask you one more time.\nLeads back to:\n\"What was the piece of evidence found underneath the victim's body?\"Phoenix:\nThat's simple, Your Honor. A broken pair of glasses.Judge:\nThat's right.Gumshoe:\nThe victim grabbed the criminal's glasses as he was being shoved, sir, and held onto them as he fell.Phoenix:\n...Byrde:\nHey! Why are you giving me the evil eye!?Phoenix:\nThose glasses you're wearing...Byrde:\nNnnngh... Yes, this is my spare pair. But these glasses they found at the scene of the crime are not mine! I swear, sir!Phoenix:\nYou sure about that?Byrde:\nLook, it was a coincidence that on that same day, I accidentally stepped on mine!Phoenix:\n(A \"coincidence\" she says... Urk...)Payne:\nEh hee hee hee hee hee hee! Your Honor. I have further evidence to present.Judge:\nOh? You have more?Payne:\nAnd this evidence is very decisive.Judge:\nVery well! Let's hear from our witness about this \"evidence\".Witness Testimony-- Decisive Evidence --Gumshoe:\nThere's something even more incriminating than the glasses under the victim's body, sir.\nDuring his date, the victim was pushed from the bench area.\nBut he managed to write the culprit's name on the ground where he landed.\nI don't like saying it, but it was clearly the defendant's name, \"Maggie\", sir.\nWith this piece of evidence and the glasses, it's hard to say she's not the culprit.Payne:\nThis is a picture of the writing, Your Honor.Judge:\nWhy, this is...! Yes, I can see the name is clearly written here.Payne:\nThe prosecution would like to submit this picture.Judge:\nUnderstood. The court accepts it into evidence.Crime Photo 2 added to the Court Record.Phoenix:\nAs if the glasses alone didn't make you look suspicious, the victim even wrote your name clear as day on the ground!Byrde:\nBut, but, but, I already told you! Those glasses aren't mine!!Phoenix:\nAnd how do you explain his dying message?Byrde:\n... It's a conspiracy! I'm not guilty, sir!Judge:\nMr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Phoenix:\nCross-examine?Byrde:\nThis is it! I'm counting on you!Phoenix:\nSure... But what am I supposed to do?Byrde:\nWHAT!? This isn't like you at all! Normally, this is the part where you get in the witnesses' faces!Phoenix:\nGet in their faces and do what?Byrde:\nI guess there's no way around it! OK, I'm going to lend you a hand! The prosecution's witnesses all hide things from the court, which means they lie from time to time.Phoenix:\nLie? But... isn't that detective your superior?Byrde:\nWell, even if they don't mean to lie, sometimes people just remember things wrong.Phoenix:\nHmm, like that detective. He does sort of look like a scatterbrain...Byrde:\nIt doesn't matter! Either way, it's bad for us, sir! That's why when you question witnesses, you have to find and expose their lies!Judge:\nMr. Wright. Your cross-examination, please.Phoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor. (Talk about trial by fire. Here goes nothing. As long as I can \"expose the lies\", we should be alright.)Cross Examination-- Decisive Evidence --Gumshoe:\nThere's something even more incriminating than the glasses under the victim's body, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHmm, about those glasses... Do you have any proof that those belong to my client?\nGumshoe:\nThe lenses are for near-sightedness, and are almost the same strength as hers. Even the frames look kinda like the ones she's wearing in her ID, pal.\nPhoenix:\nHmm... (What should I do now?)\n\n\n\nContinue pressing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Almost\" and \"kinda\" are not good enough in a case like this!\nGumshoe:\nEr, um...\nPhoenix:\nDo you have more definitive proof? Is there something that clearly links the defendant with those glasses!?\nGumshoe:\nEr, um, uh... The dirt and sand rubbed out any traces of fingerprints or anything else.\nPhoenix:\nSo what you are saying, detective, is that you have nothing that proves those glasses are my client's.\nGumshoe:\nUm, something like that...\nPayne:\nWh-Wh-What!?\nJudge:\nI see... Hmm... So there is no proof...\nByrde:\nWow, that was amazing! I could totally feel it, down in my gut!\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nLeave it be\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(We're in real trouble if those glasses really are hers... It's probably better to back out while we can.)\nByrde:\nArgh... Why don't you believe me...?\nLeads back to cross-examinationGumshoe:\nDuring his date, the victim was pushed from the bench area.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nNow, you're sure he was pushed and that's how he fell?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, pal. If you look at the wounds on the victim's body, there's no way it was anything else.\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\nJudge:\nPlease continue with your testimony, detective.\nGumshoe:\nAnyway, the victim fell pretty far...Gumshoe:\nBut he managed to write the culprit's name on the ground where he landed.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe culprit's name?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. I was surprised, too. I didn't want to believe it, but...\nPhoenix:\nWas the name that of my client?Present Maggey Byrde profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...\"Gumshoe:\nI don't like saying it, but it was clearly the defendant's name, \"Maggie\", sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely certain!?\nGumshoe:\nSorry, pal, but that's what it said. This is a picture of it. No matter which way you look, it still says \"Maggie\".\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... He's got a point...)\nByrde:\nHey, hold on!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nByrde:\nDon't \"huh\" me! I know the picture says \"Maggie\", but...\nPhoenix:\n(Now that she mentions it, something does feel kind of off about this picture...)\nByrde:\nThat's how you know you found a contradiction! Now hurry up and present some evidence!\nPhoenix:\n(So THAT'S what spotting a contradiction feels like... I'd better check the Court Record again...)Present Maggey Byrde profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...\"Gumshoe:\nWith this piece of evidence and the glasses, it's hard to say she's not the culprit.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd you are certain that it was the victim who wrote the name on the ground?\nGumshoe:\nThere were scratches on his fingers from the rough sand, and there were grains of sand stuck under his pointer finger nail.\nJudge:\nHmm... It certainly seems that the name was written by the victim himself.\nPhoenix:\n(That didn't go well. If it really was him, then we're in a lot of trouble...)Present Maggey Byrde profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...\"Byrde:\nDon't give up! Keep that fighting spirit going!Phoenix:\nI'm glad you're all pumped up, but...Byrde:\nI really want to see your \"special move\", sir!Phoenix:\nMy what??Byrde:\nYou always look so cool when you present evidence!Phoenix:\nPresent... evidence?Oh, THAT present evidence!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nActually, I was just thinking about that!\nByrde:\nYes! The great Phoenix Wright is back! Oh, that's right.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nByrde:\nI heard that lately, you can present not only evidence, but people's profiles as well! It sure makes things a bit more complicated, so be careful, sir!\nPhoenix:\n(People's profiles, huh? Alright, let's give this another try.)Enlighten me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm, about this \"presenting evidence\"...\nByrde:\nOK. When you're listening to testimony, you can compare, it with the Court Record. If you do that, you're sure to find contradictions in the witness's statements!\nPhoenix:\nC-Contradictions?\nByrde:\nWell, there are many reasons why a testimony might contradict the evidence. The witness might be lying, or maybe they're just mistaken.\nPhoenix:\nUh huh. And?\nByrde:\nYou still have no idea what I'm talking about?? When you find a contradiction, open the Court Record to the item you need...\nPhoenix:\nAnd then I present that evidence, right!?\nByrde:\nYou got it! You can also present people's profiles as evidence! With so many items, make sure you present the right thing!\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Sounds complicated, but I'll give it a try. You're pretty good at this.\nByrde:\nWow, being praised by a pro! I don't know what to say!Phoenix:\n... ... ...Judge:\nWh-What is it?Phoenix:\n... (What... What's come over me...? Without thinking, I just blurted out, \"Objection!\"... And I yelled it at the top of my lungs, finger outstretched, ready to take on my opponent! What a rush!) Detective Gumshoe!Gumshoe:\nY-You talking to me, pal?Phoenix:\nPlease state the defendant's name for me!Payne:Payne:\nWhat are you trying to prove with this futile exercise, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nYou'll see. This is a very crucial line of questioning! Actually, Mr. Payne, you can answer. The defendant's name, if you please.Payne:\nWh-Where is this ridiculous question coming from? The defendant's, uh, name is, uh... \"Maggie Byrde\".Phoenix:\nI think someone needs to check the Court Record.Payne:\nWhat...? It says right here that it's \"Maggey Byrde\". Aaaah!!Phoenix:\nIt looks like the bird caught the cat napping!Judge:\nWhat's going on here!?Gumshoe:\nI have no idea either, sir!Phoenix:\nAs you can see, the victim did indeed leave a name, \"Maggie\". However, the defendant's name is actually spelled, \"Maggey\"! This is a blatant contradiction of facts!Judge:\nOhh!Gumshoe:\nHow about that? I hadn't even noticed!Payne:Payne:\nBut, but, but...! But maybe the victim didn't know how to spell her name correctly...Phoenix:Phoenix:\nMay I remind you that it was you who said, \"The defendant is accused of killing her lover.\" If they were truly lovers, it would be impossible for him to have not known her name!Payne:\nNoooo!Judge:\nThis is very true. Mr. Payne.Payne:\nY-Yes, Your Honor?Judge:\nAre you absolutely certain that the defendant and the victim, Dustin Prince, were, in fact, lovers?Payne:\nY-Yes, I am quite certain, Your Honor. They were a well-known couple in the police force.Judge:\nDetective Gumshoe. Please testify for the court the relationship between the victim and the defendant.Gumshoe:\nYes, sir...Witness Testimony-- Dustin and Maggey --Gumshoe:\n{{tt|Officer Prince and Officer Byrde had been going out for about half a year.\nIt sounded like they were even talking about marriage.\nThe day of the incident just happened to be the victim's birthday, sir.\nMaggey... I mean Officer Byrde, had gotten Officer Prince a present.\nIt was something she had bought over 2 months ago. (Changed from [It was something she had gotten over 2 months ago.] in the original release)\nI should know, 'cause she came to me to ask what she should get for him.Judge:\nOh... Those two sound like they were close...Payne:\nNevertheless, tragedy struck.Judge:\nHmm, yes, I see... You may cross-examine the witness, Mr. Wright.Cross Examination",
    "newContext": "-- Decisive Evidence --Gumshoe:\nThere's something even more incriminating than the glasses under the victim's body, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHmm, about those glasses... Do you have any proof that those belong to my client?\nGumshoe:\nThe lenses are for near-sightedness, and are almost the same strength as hers. Even the frames look kinda like the ones she's wearing in her ID, pal.\nPhoenix:\nHmm... (What should I do now?)\n\n\n\nContinue pressing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Almost\" and \"kinda\" are not good enough in a case like this!\nGumshoe:\nEr, um...\nPhoenix:\nDo you have more definitive proof? Is there something that clearly links the defendant with those glasses!?\nGumshoe:\nEr, um, uh... The dirt and sand rubbed out any traces of fingerprints or anything else.\nPhoenix:\nSo what you are saying, detective, is that you have nothing that proves those glasses are my client's.\nGumshoe:\nUm, something like that...\nPayne:\nWh-Wh-What!?\nJudge:\nI see... Hmm... So there is no proof...\nByrde:\nWow, that was amazing! I could totally feel it, down in my gut!\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nLeave it be\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(We're in real trouble if those glasses really are hers... It's probably better to back out while we can.)\nByrde:\nArgh... Why don't you believe me...?\nLeads back to cross-examinationGumshoe:\nDuring his date, the victim was pushed from the bench area.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nNow, you're sure he was pushed and that's how he fell?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, pal. If you look at the wounds on the victim's body, there's no way it was anything else.\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\nJudge:\nPlease continue with your testimony, detective.\nGumshoe:\nAnyway, the victim fell pretty far...Gumshoe:\nBut he managed to write the culprit's name on the ground where he landed.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe culprit's name?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. I was surprised, too. I didn't want to believe it, but...\nPhoenix:\nWas the name that of my client?Present Maggey Byrde profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...\"Gumshoe:\nI don't like saying it, but it was clearly the defendant's name, \"Maggie\", sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely certain!?\nGumshoe:\nSorry, pal, but that's what it said. This is a picture of it. No matter which way you look, it still says \"Maggie\".\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... He's got a point...)\nByrde:\nHey, hold on!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nByrde:\nDon't \"huh\" me! I know the picture says \"Maggie\", but...\nPhoenix:\n(Now that she mentions it, something does feel kind of off about this picture...)\nByrde:\nThat's how you know you found a contradiction! Now hurry up and present some evidence!\nPhoenix:\n(So THAT'S what spotting a contradiction feels like... I'd better check the Court Record again...)Present Maggey Byrde profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...\"Gumshoe:\nWith this piece of evidence and the glasses, it's hard to say she's not the culprit.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd you are certain that it was the victim who wrote the name on the ground?\nGumshoe:\nThere were scratches on his fingers from the rough sand, and there were grains of sand stuck under his pointer finger nail.\nJudge:\nHmm... It certainly seems that the name was written by the victim himself.\nPhoenix:\n(That didn't go well. If it really was him, then we're in a lot of trouble...)Present Maggey Byrde profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...\"Byrde:\nDon't give up! Keep that fighting spirit going!Phoenix:\nI'm glad you're all pumped up, but...Byrde:\nI really want to see your \"special move\", sir!Phoenix:\nMy what??Byrde:\nYou always look so cool when you present evidence!Phoenix:\nPresent... evidence?Oh, THAT present evidence!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nActually, I was just thinking about that!\nByrde:\nYes! The great Phoenix Wright is back! Oh, that's right.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nByrde:\nI heard that lately, you can present not only evidence, but people's profiles as well! It sure makes things a bit more complicated, so be careful, sir!\nPhoenix:\n(People's profiles, huh? Alright, let's give this another try.)Enlighten me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm, about this \"presenting evidence\"...\nByrde:\nOK. When you're listening to testimony, you can compare, it with the Court Record. If you do that, you're sure to find contradictions in the witness's statements!\nPhoenix:\nC-Contradictions?\nByrde:\nWell, there are many reasons why a testimony might contradict the evidence. The witness might be lying, or maybe they're just mistaken.\nPhoenix:\nUh huh. And?\nByrde:\nYou still have no idea what I'm talking about?? When you find a contradiction, open the Court Record to the item you need...\nPhoenix:\nAnd then I present that evidence, right!?\nByrde:\nYou got it! You can also present people's profiles as evidence! With so many items, make sure you present the right thing!\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Sounds complicated, but I'll give it a try. You're pretty good at this.\nByrde:\nWow, being praised by a pro! I don't know what to say!Phoenix:\n... ... ...Judge:\nWh-What is it?Phoenix:\n... (What... What's come over me...?

You can't run forever, Mr. Phoenix Wright!Phoenix:\nWha...!? What have I done wrong!?I cannot allow you to go on like this!Phoenix:\n...? B-But I'm just a simple defense attorney!Silence! You are no longer worthy of your title.September 8, 9:08 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Phoenix:\nWhat a nightmare... And I bet it was this ringtone that caused it... I really shouldn't be dozing off right before a trial starts anyway...Phone:\n...*beep*...Phoenix: \nHuh... looks like they hung up.???:\nAh, good. I finally found it. Talk about a close call. I hate to do this to you, but... It's nothing personal... Mr. Attorney.A few minutes later...District CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Phoenix:\n... Ouch... My head... It's throbbing... And why does it feel... so foggy in there...????: \nGooood morning!Phoenix: \nAck! Uh... G-Good morning...???: \nWhat's wrong!? You don't look well! People are at their best first thing in the morning! Where's that fighting spirit!?Phoenix: \n... Sorry, but can you please turn the cheeriness down? My head... sort of hurts...???: \nRoger that!Phoenix: \n...???: \n...Phoenix: \n... Um... Am I in trouble or something????: \nHuh? \"Trouble...?\"Phoenix: \nW-Wait, never mind. You're a policewoman, right? I thought maybe I had done something wrong...????: \nWh-What are you talking about? I'm the one in trouble!Phoenix: \n... What?Byrde: \nI'm placing my life in your hands today, Mr. Phoenix Wright!Phoenix: \nLife... in... my hands...?Byrde: \nYou promised me! You said you would prove that I was not guilty!Phoenix: \n\"N... Not... guilty\"?Byrde: \nJust when I thought all hope was lost; when all the other lawyers had laughed me off... \"Leave it to me!\" you said! You! The one and only Phoenix Wright came to save the day! And just like that, I was moved to tears, sir! I'll never forget what you're doing for me, EVER!Phoenix:\n(What is this girl babbling about...?)Byrde: \nActually, I really love to watch court proceedings, and I always root for you to win! When I'm off duty, I like to come here and... ...? What's wrong? You've been acting really strange and you keep staring at me. You're making me kind of nervous, sir...Phoenix: \nOh... sorry. (Hmm... I'm afraid to ask, but here goes...) So, this might sound bad, but... uh... Who are you...?Byrde: \nWhaaaaat!? Mr. Wright!! How can you say that!? How can you do this to the fragile heart of a girl about to go on trial...? You're absolutely horrible!Phoenix: \nNo -- I mean, I didn't mean it like that!Byrde:\nIs this how a defense attorney treats his clients, sir!? I can't believe this!!Phoenix:\nNo, it's just... ...Well, I think you have the wrong person. I'm...Byrde:\nYes...!? \"I'm...\"!?Phoenix: \n... ... I'm... Who am I? (Why am I drawing a blank...?)Bailiff:\nThe trial will begin shortly. Will the defendant and her lawyer please proceed to the courtroom immediately!Byrde: \nThe trial's about to start! I'm counting on you in there, OK?Phoenix: \n(Hmm... I guess I must have amnesia... Let's see... What can I piece together...? Hmm, from our conversation, I can safely say that I'm probably a defense attorney. And that girl... I said I'd prove her \"not guilty\"... I can't believe I made such an irresponsible promise.) Aaaaaargh! Someone, please!! Tell me this is just a bad dream!(Why do I get the feeling this is one dream I won't be waking up from...? *gulp*)September 8, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Maggey Byrde.Payne:\nThe prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:\n...Judge:\nWhat is it, Mr. Wright?Phoenix: \nUm, er... Are you talking to me...?Judge: \nDo you see any other defense attorneys here?Phoenix: \n(I guess not.) (Changed from [I guess not. Urk.] in the original release)Judge: \nNow then, are you ready?Yes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I should say, \"Yes\" for now.)\nJudge: \nAre you ready, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix: \nYes, Your Honor. (... Wait a sec... If her life is in my hands... I should really do the responsible thing...)\nLeads to:\n\"Actually, you see, Your Honor... My memory is kind of...\"No\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... What if I said, \"No\"? Would that be alright?\nJudge:\nOf course it wouldn't!\nPhoenix:\n(Then why bother asking to begin with??)\nLeads to:\n\"Actually, you see, Your Honor... My memory is kind of...\"Phoenix:\nActually, you see, Your Honor... My memory is kind of...Judge:\nThe court will not hear the defense's excuses. Because the defendant is a member of the police, this case is under great scrutiny. Therefore, we must make this trial fair but swift. I believe I have told you this before. I hope you're not telling me you've forgotten!Phoenix:\n(Actually, I have...) (Changed from [Actually, I did...] in the original release)Judge:\nMr. Payne, your opening statement, please.Payne:\nYes, Your Honor. As I'm sure you're well aware, the defendant is accused of killing her lover. What's worse, her lover was a fellow police officer!Phoenix:\nA policeman? You did WHAT to a policeman!?Byrde:\nIt wasn't me! And besides, Dustin and I... We weren't \"lovers\" like that!Payne:\nIn any case... The prosecution will prove that the guilty party is none other than the defendant!Judge:\nVery well. Mr. Payne, please call your first witness.Payne:\nHee, hee, hee. It's been a while, Mr. Wright. Let's see what you've learned since last time. I won't show you any mercy this time, rookie!Phoenix:\nOkaaay... (And who are you again!?)Payne:\nThe prosecution calls Detective Dick Gumshoe to the stand. (Changed from [Please bring Detective Dick Gumshoe to the stand.] in the original release)Byrde:\nHere we go! Don't let me down, Mr. Wright!Phoenix:\n(Nowhere to hide... I'm sooo dead...)Payne:\nWitness, please state your name and occupation.Gumshoe:\nMy name is Dick Gumshoe, sir. I'm the detective in charge of homicides down at the precinct, sir.Judge:\nYou don't look very well, Detective.Gumshoe:\nWell, sir, the defendant... She works under me, so, you know...Phoenix:\nYou work under that detective?Byrde:\nYes, sir! And while I was a trainee, he was always watching out for me, sir! He's such a wonderful guy, sir! I'll never forget what he's done for me!Phoenix:\n(OK, calm down, I believe you.)Payne:\nDetective Gumshoe. Please describe for us the details of this murder.Gumshoe:\nYes, sir. It happened at the park near headquarters, \"Expos√© Park\". The victim was one of the local cops, Dustin Prince. He was pushed down from the benches on the upper path, sir. The landing beat his body up bad and snapped his neck.Payne:\nThe details are listed in the report that was distributed yesterday...Judge:\nAh, yes. This autopsy report, correct?Phoenix:\n(Why do I not remember getting a copy...?)Judge:\nI see everything is in order here. Even the estimated time of death is unusually well documented!Gumshoe:\nThe victim's watch stopped from the impact of the landing, sir. The results of the autopsy confirmed the time of death.Payne:\nIf I may, Your Honor, the prosecution would like to submit this photograph.Judge:\nVery well. The court accepts it into evidence.Crime Photo 1 added to the Court Record.Judge:\nNow then, I recall at yesterday's preliminary hearing, a very important piece of evidence was brought to our attention.Payne:\nYes, Your Honor.Gumshoe:\nYes, sir.Phoenix:\nYes... I guess?Judge:\nMr. Wright! Is your head on right today!? There was a very crucial piece of evidence found under the victim's body!Phoenix:\nUm, was there?Byrde:\nHave you lost your mind!?Phoenix:\nWell, actually... Um, it's just nerves. Give me a second.Byrde:\nWhaaaat!? How can you talk like such an amateur!? I thought you were a pro, sir! ... Alright, sir. I'll help you through this! At a time like this, maybe you ought to take a glance at the Court Record!Phoenix:\n...Court Record?Byrde:\nYup! Info about evidence and people involved with this case are all listed there, sir! You can look a the Court Record by pressing [the R Button / Tab]! (Changed from [You can look at the Court Record by touching the Court Record Button!] in the original release)Phoenix:\n[The R Button / Tab], huh... You really know what you're talking about, don't you? (Changed from [The Court Record Button...? You really know what you're talking about, huh?] in the original release)Byrde:\nIt's too bad I'm a cop, right? Just think! I could totally be a legal aide instead!Judge:\nMr. Wright.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor!Judge:\nCourt is in session. Save your chit-chat for later!Phoenix:\nS-Sorry, Your Honor... (Well, I guess I'd better check the Court Record, and see what I can find... What was it again? [The R Button / Tab]...? (Changed from [What was it again? The Court Record Button...?] in the original release))Judge:\nAlright, Mr. Wright. Let's see if your notes are in order. What was the piece of evidence found underneath the victim's body?A wallet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... I'm pretty sure it was a wallet...\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nThis is a court of law! You can't just make wild guesses!\nJudge:\nAgreed.\nByrde:\nThey're right, Mr. Wright! You have to check the Court Record before you answer! If you don't, your client might end up with a guilty verdict!\nPhoenix:\n(\"Your client\"? You do realize that's you, right?)\nJudge:\nI will ask you one more time.\nLeads back to:\n\"What was the piece of evidence found underneath the victim's body?\"Glasses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"That's simple, Your Honor. A broken pair of glasses.\"A police badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIf he's a cop, then I guess maybe a badge or something...\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nMr. Wright! Please stick to the facts of this case!\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe is a policeman, correct?\nPayne:\nI don't think you understand the problem here.\nJudge:\nI will not have an uninformed lawyer in my court.\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. (Guess there's no fooling those two.)\nByrde:\nPlease, for my sake, look at the Court Record, sir!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh, with [the R Button / Tab], right?) (Changed from [Uh, it's the Court Record Button, right?] in the original release)\nJudge:\nI will ask you one more time.\nLeads back to:\n\"What was the piece of evidence found underneath the victim's body?\"Phoenix:\nThat's simple, Your Honor. A broken pair of glasses.Judge:\nThat's right.Gumshoe:\nThe victim grabbed the criminal's glasses as he was being shoved, sir, and held onto them as he fell.Phoenix:\n...Byrde:\nHey! Why are you giving me the evil eye!?Phoenix:\nThose glasses you're wearing...Byrde:\nNnnngh... Yes, this is my spare pair. But these glasses they found at the scene of the crime are not mine! I swear, sir!Phoenix:\nYou sure about that?Byrde:\nLook, it was a coincidence that on that same day, I accidentally stepped on mine!Phoenix:\n(A \"coincidence\" she says... Urk...)Payne:\nEh hee hee hee hee hee hee! Your Honor. I have further evidence to present.Judge:\nOh? You have more?Payne:\nAnd this evidence is very decisive.Judge:\nVery well! Let's hear from our witness about this \"evidence\".Witness Testimony-- Decisive Evidence --Gumshoe:\nThere's something even more incriminating than the glasses under the victim's body, sir.\nDuring his date, the victim was pushed from the bench area.\nBut he managed to write the culprit's name on the ground where he landed.\nI don't like saying it, but it was clearly the defendant's name, \"Maggie\", sir.\nWith this piece of evidence and the glasses, it's hard to say she's not the culprit.Payne:\nThis is a picture of the writing, Your Honor.Judge:\nWhy, this is...! Yes, I can see the name is clearly written here.Payne:\nThe prosecution would like to submit this picture.Judge:\nUnderstood. The court accepts it into evidence.Crime Photo 2 added to the Court Record.Phoenix:\nAs if the glasses alone didn't make you look suspicious, the victim even wrote your name clear as day on the ground!Byrde:\nBut, but, but, I already told you! Those glasses aren't mine!!Phoenix:\nAnd how do you explain his dying message?Byrde:\n... It's a conspiracy! I'm not guilty, sir!Judge:\nMr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Phoenix:\nCross-examine?Byrde:\nThis is it! I'm counting on you!Phoenix:\nSure... But what am I supposed to do?Byrde:\nWHAT!? This isn't like you at all! Normally, this is the part where you get in the witnesses' faces!Phoenix:\nGet in their faces and do what?Byrde:\nI guess there's no way around it! OK, I'm going to lend you a hand! The prosecution's witnesses all hide things from the court, which means they lie from time to time.Phoenix:\nLie? But... isn't that detective your superior?Byrde:\nWell, even if they don't mean to lie, sometimes people just remember things wrong.Phoenix:\nHmm, like that detective. He does sort of look like a scatterbrain...Byrde:\nIt doesn't matter! Either way, it's bad for us, sir! That's why when you question witnesses, you have to find and expose their lies!Judge:\nMr. Wright. Your cross-examination, please.Phoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor. (Talk about trial by fire. Here goes nothing. As long as I can \"expose the lies\", we should be alright.)Cross Examination-- Decisive Evidence --Gumshoe:\nThere's something even more incriminating than the glasses under the victim's body, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHmm, about those glasses... Do you have any proof that those belong to my client?\nGumshoe:\nThe lenses are for near-sightedness, and are almost the same strength as hers. Even the frames look kinda like the ones she's wearing in her ID, pal.\nPhoenix:\nHmm... (What should I do now?)\n\n\n\nContinue pressing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Almost\" and \"kinda\" are not good enough in a case like this!\nGumshoe:\nEr, um...\nPhoenix:\nDo you have more definitive proof? Is there something that clearly links the defendant with those glasses!?\nGumshoe:\nEr, um, uh... The dirt and sand rubbed out any traces of fingerprints or anything else.\nPhoenix:\nSo what you are saying, detective, is that you have nothing that proves those glasses are my client's.\nGumshoe:\nUm, something like that...\nPayne:\nWh-Wh-What!?\nJudge:\nI see... Hmm... So there is no proof...\nByrde:\nWow, that was amazing! I could totally feel it, down in my gut!\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nLeave it be\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(We're in real trouble if those glasses really are hers... It's probably better to back out while we can.)\nByrde:\nArgh...

If you look at the wounds on the victim's body, there's no way it was anything else.\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\nJudge:\nPlease continue with your testimony, detective.\nGumshoe:\nAnyway, the victim fell pretty far...Gumshoe:\nBut he managed to write the culprit's name on the ground where he landed.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe culprit's name?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. I was surprised, too. I didn't want to believe it, but...\nPhoenix:\nWas the name that of my client?Present Maggey Byrde profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...\"Gumshoe:\nI don't like saying it, but it was clearly the defendant's name, \"Maggie\", sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely certain!?\nGumshoe:\nSorry, pal, but that's what it said. This is a picture of it. No matter which way you look, it still says \"Maggie\".\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... He's got a point...)\nByrde:\nHey, hold on!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nByrde:\nDon't \"huh\" me! I know the picture says \"Maggie\", but...\nPhoenix:\n(Now that she mentions it, something does feel kind of off about this picture...)\nByrde:\nThat's how you know you found a contradiction!

The great Phoenix Wright is back! Oh, that's right.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nByrde:\nI heard that lately, you can present not only evidence, but people's profiles as well! It sure makes things a bit more complicated, so be careful, sir!\nPhoenix:\n(People's profiles, huh? Alright, let's give this another try.)Enlighten me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm, about this \"presenting evidence\"...\nByrde:\nOK. When you're listening to testimony, you can compare, it with the Court Record. If you do that, you're sure to find contradictions in the witness's statements!\nPhoenix:\nC-Contradictions?\nByrde:\nWell, there are many reasons why a testimony might contradict the evidence. The witness might be lying, or maybe they're just mistaken.\nPhoenix:\nUh huh. And?\nByrde:\nYou still have no idea what I'm talking about?? When you find a contradiction, open the Court Record to the item you need...\nPhoenix:\nAnd then I present that evidence, right!?\nByrde:\nYou got it! You can also present people's profiles as evidence! With so many items, make sure you present the right thing!\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Sounds complicated, but I'll give it a try. You're pretty good at this.\nByrde:\nWow, being praised by a pro! I don't know what to say!Phoenix:\n... ... ...Judge:\nWh-What is it?Phoenix:\n... (What... What's come over me...? Without thinking, I just blurted out, \"Objection!\"... And I yelled it at the top of my lungs, finger outstretched, ready to take on my opponent! What a rush!) Detective Gumshoe!Gumshoe:\nY-You talking to me, pal?Phoenix:\nPlease state the defendant's name for me!Payne:Payne:\nWhat are you trying to prove with this futile exercise, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nYou'll see. This is a very crucial line of questioning! Actually, Mr. Payne, you can answer. The defendant's name, if you please.Payne:\nWh-Where is this ridiculous question coming from? The defendant's, uh, name is, uh... \"Maggie Byrde\".Phoenix:\nI think someone needs to check the Court Record.Payne:\nWhat...? It says right here that it's \"Maggey Byrde\". Aaaah!!Phoenix:\nIt looks like the bird caught the cat napping!Judge:\nWhat's going on here!?Gumshoe:\nI have no idea either, sir!Phoenix:\nAs you can see, the victim did indeed leave a name, \"Maggie\". However, the defendant's name is actually spelled, \"Maggey\"! This is a blatant contradiction of facts!Judge:\nOhh!Gumshoe:\nHow about that? I hadn't even noticed!Payne:Payne:\nBut, but, but...! But maybe the victim didn't know how to spell her name correctly...Phoenix:Phoenix:\nMay I remind you that it was you who said, \"The defendant is accused of killing her lover.\" If they were truly lovers, it would be impossible for him to have not known her name!Payne:\nNoooo!Judge:\nThis is very true. Mr. Payne.Payne:\nY-Yes, Your Honor?Judge:\nAre you absolutely certain that the defendant and the victim, Dustin Prince, were, in fact, lovers?Payne:\nY-Yes, I am quite certain, Your Honor.

If you are that convinced, then let's hear some more about this matter.Gumshoe:\nActually, I brought the glove with me today.Phoenix:\nAnd?Judge:\nWhy didn't you say so earlier?

It is clear that the victim and the defendant were involved with each other.Payne:\nYes, that's correct, Your Honor.Judge:\nNow, if that is true, it brings up an important question. Was the name \"Maggie\" really written by the victim?Payne:\nI see your point, Your Honor.

That glove is the key to this whole case!Byrde:\nYes! Bluffing to the max! Now, THIS is the Mr. Wright I know! I'm so happy you're back, sir! I was wondering how long it'd take! This is great!Phoenix:\n(Hmm, pressing people... It feels like I've done this before. As if I used to do this to squeeze information from even the most tight-lipped people.)Judge:\nVery well. If you are that convinced, then let's hear some more about this matter.Gumshoe:\nActually, I brought the glove with me today.Phoenix:\nAnd?Judge:\nWhy didn't you say so earlier? Hurry and show the glove to this court!Gumshoe:\nWell, I didn't think it had anything to do with this case... Anyway, this is it, sir.Judge:\nIt's, uh... rather yellow, isn't it?Baseball Glove added to the Court Record.Gumshoe:\nOfficer Prince really liked the color yellow.Phoenix:\nAnd that's why you had to special order it?Byrde:\nYup, that's right! That, and one other reason...Judge:\nI think this court has heard enough. It is clear that the victim and the defendant were involved with each other.Payne:\nYes, that's correct, Your Honor.Judge:\nNow, if that is true, it brings up an important question. Was the name \"Maggie\" really written by the victim?Payne:\nI see your point, Your Honor. Detective Gumshoe, please tell the court a little more about the name on the ground.Gumshoe:\nYes, sir.Witness Testimony-- Writing on the Ground --Gumshoe:\nWe first looked into the handwriting. (Changed from [We first looked into the handwriting, sir.] in the original release)\nUnfortunately, we couldn't confirm that it was the victim's handwriting.\nNext, we checked the victim's pointer finger.\nWe found out that there was sand trapped under the victim's fingernail.\nThere were also scratches on the skin that were caused by him writing on the ground.\nFrom this, we could confirm that the victim wrote this name with his right hand.Judge:\nHmm... Yes, a perfectly logical conclusion. Now then, Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Phoenix:\nThank you, Your Honor.Cross Examination",

You can't run forever, Mr. Phoenix Wright!Phoenix:\nWha...!? What have I done wrong!?I cannot allow you to go on like this!Phoenix:\n...? B-But I'm just a simple defense attorney!Silence! You are no longer worthy of your title.September 8, 9:08 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Phoenix:\nWhat a nightmare... And I bet it was this ringtone that caused it... I really shouldn't be dozing off right before a trial starts anyway...Phone:\n...*beep*...Phoenix: \nHuh... looks like they hung up.???:\nAh, good. I finally found it. Talk about a close call. I hate to do this to you, but... It's nothing personal... Mr. Attorney.A few minutes later...District CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Phoenix:\n... Ouch... My head... It's throbbing... And why does it feel... so foggy in there...????: \nGooood morning!Phoenix: \nAck! Uh... G-Good morning...???: \nWhat's wrong!? You don't look well! People are at their best first thing in the morning! Where's that fighting spirit!?Phoenix: \n... Sorry, but can you please turn the cheeriness down? My head... sort of hurts...???: \nRoger that!Phoenix: \n...???: \n...Phoenix: \n... Um... Am I in trouble or something????: \nHuh? \"Trouble...?\"Phoenix: \nW-Wait, never mind. You're a policewoman, right? I thought maybe I had done something wrong...????: \nWh-What are you talking about? I'm the one in trouble!Phoenix: \n... What?Byrde: \nI'm placing my life in your hands today, Mr. Phoenix Wright!Phoenix: \nLife... in... my hands...?Byrde: \nYou promised me! You said you would prove that I was not guilty!Phoenix: \n\"N... Not... guilty\"?Byrde: \nJust when I thought all hope was lost; when all the other lawyers had laughed me off... \"Leave it to me!\" you said! You! The one and only Phoenix Wright came to save the day! And just like that, I was moved to tears, sir! I'll never forget what you're doing for me, EVER!Phoenix:\n(What is this girl babbling about...?)Byrde: \nActually, I really love to watch court proceedings, and I always root for you to win! When I'm off duty, I like to come here and... ...? What's wrong? You've been acting really strange and you keep staring at me. You're making me kind of nervous, sir...Phoenix: \nOh... sorry. (Hmm... I'm afraid to ask, but here goes...) So, this might sound bad, but... uh... Who are you...?Byrde: \nWhaaaaat!? Mr. Wright!! How can you say that!? How can you do this to the fragile heart of a girl about to go on trial...? You're absolutely horrible!Phoenix: \nNo -- I mean, I didn't mean it like that!Byrde:\nIs this how a defense attorney treats his clients, sir!? I can't believe this!!Phoenix:\nNo, it's just... ...Well, I think you have the wrong person. I'm...Byrde:\nYes...!? \"I'm...\"!?Phoenix: \n... ... I'm... Who am I? (Why am I drawing a blank...?)Bailiff:\nThe trial will begin shortly. Will the defendant and her lawyer please proceed to the courtroom immediately!Byrde: \nThe trial's about to start! I'm counting on you in there, OK?Phoenix: \n(Hmm... I guess I must have amnesia... Let's see... What can I piece together...? Hmm, from our conversation, I can safely say that I'm probably a defense attorney. And that girl... I said I'd prove her \"not guilty\"... I can't believe I made such an irresponsible promise.) Aaaaaargh! Someone, please!! Tell me this is just a bad dream!(Why do I get the feeling this is one dream I won't be waking up from...? *gulp*)September 8, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Maggey Byrde.Payne:\nThe prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:\n...Judge:\nWhat is it, Mr. Wright?Phoenix: \nUm, er... Are you talking to me...?Judge: \nDo you see any other defense attorneys here?Phoenix: \n(I guess not.) (Changed from [I guess not. Urk.] in the original release)Judge: \nNow then, are you ready?Yes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I should say, \"Yes\" for now.)\nJudge: \nAre you ready, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix: \nYes, Your Honor. (... Wait a sec... If her life is in my hands... I should really do the responsible thing...)\nLeads to:\n\"Actually, you see, Your Honor... My memory is kind of...\"No\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... What if I said, \"No\"? Would that be alright?\nJudge:\nOf course it wouldn't!\nPhoenix:\n(Then why bother asking to begin with??)\nLeads to:\n\"Actually, you see, Your Honor... My memory is kind of...\"Phoenix:\nActually, you see, Your Honor... My memory is kind of...Judge:\nThe court will not hear the defense's excuses. Because the defendant is a member of the police, this case is under great scrutiny. Therefore, we must make this trial fair but swift. I believe I have told you this before. I hope you're not telling me you've forgotten!Phoenix:\n(Actually, I have...) (Changed from [Actually, I did...] in the original release)Judge:\nMr. Payne, your opening statement, please.Payne:\nYes, Your Honor. As I'm sure you're well aware, the defendant is accused of killing her lover. What's worse, her lover was a fellow police officer!Phoenix:\nA policeman? You did WHAT to a policeman!?Byrde:\nIt wasn't me! And besides, Dustin and I... We weren't \"lovers\" like that!Payne:\nIn any case... The prosecution will prove that the guilty party is none other than the defendant!Judge:\nVery well. Mr. Payne, please call your first witness.Payne:\nHee, hee, hee. It's been a while, Mr. Wright. Let's see what you've learned since last time. I won't show you any mercy this time, rookie!Phoenix:\nOkaaay... (And who are you again!?)Payne:\nThe prosecution calls Detective Dick Gumshoe to the stand. (Changed from [Please bring Detective Dick Gumshoe to the stand.] in the original release)Byrde:\nHere we go! Don't let me down, Mr. Wright!Phoenix:\n(Nowhere to hide... I'm sooo dead...)Payne:\nWitness, please state your name and occupation.Gumshoe:\nMy name is Dick Gumshoe, sir. I'm the detective in charge of homicides down at the precinct, sir.Judge:\nYou don't look very well, Detective.Gumshoe:\nWell, sir, the defendant... She works under me, so, you know...Phoenix:\nYou work under that detective?Byrde:\nYes, sir! And while I was a trainee, he was always watching out for me, sir! He's such a wonderful guy, sir! I'll never forget what he's done for me!Phoenix:\n(OK, calm down, I believe you.)Payne:\nDetective Gumshoe. Please describe for us the details of this murder.Gumshoe:\nYes, sir. It happened at the park near headquarters, \"Expos√© Park\". The victim was one of the local cops, Dustin Prince. He was pushed down from the benches on the upper path, sir. The landing beat his body up bad and snapped his neck.Payne:\nThe details are listed in the report that was distributed yesterday...Judge:\nAh, yes. This autopsy report, correct?Phoenix:\n(Why do I not remember getting a copy...?)Judge:\nI see everything is in order here. Even the estimated time of death is unusually well documented!Gumshoe:\nThe victim's watch stopped from the impact of the landing, sir. The results of the autopsy confirmed the time of death.Payne:\nIf I may, Your Honor, the prosecution would like to submit this photograph.Judge:\nVery well. The court accepts it into evidence.Crime Photo 1 added to the Court Record.Judge:\nNow then, I recall at yesterday's preliminary hearing, a very important piece of evidence was brought to our attention.Payne:\nYes, Your Honor.Gumshoe:\nYes, sir.Phoenix:\nYes... I guess?Judge:\nMr. Wright! Is your head on right today!? There was a very crucial piece of evidence found under the victim's body!Phoenix:\nUm, was there?Byrde:\nHave you lost your mind!?Phoenix:\nWell, actually... Um, it's just nerves. Give me a second.Byrde:\nWhaaaat!? How can you talk like such an amateur!? I thought you were a pro, sir! ... Alright, sir. I'll help you through this! At a time like this, maybe you ought to take a glance at the Court Record!Phoenix:\n...Court Record?Byrde:\nYup! Info about evidence and people involved with this case are all listed there, sir! You can look a the Court Record by pressing [the R Button / Tab]! (Changed from [You can look at the Court Record by touching the Court Record Button!] in the original release)Phoenix:\n[The R Button / Tab], huh... You really know what you're talking about, don't you? (Changed from [The Court Record Button...? You really know what you're talking about, huh?] in the original release)Byrde:\nIt's too bad I'm a cop, right? Just think! I could totally be a legal aide instead!Judge:\nMr. Wright.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor!Judge:\nCourt is in session. Save your chit-chat for later!Phoenix:\nS-Sorry, Your Honor... (Well, I guess I'd better check the Court Record, and see what I can find... What was it again? [The R Button / Tab]...? (Changed from [What was it again? The Court Record Button...?] in the original release))Judge:\nAlright, Mr. Wright. Let's see if your notes are in order. What was the piece of evidence found underneath the victim's body?A wallet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... I'm pretty sure it was a wallet...\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nThis is a court of law! You can't just make wild guesses!\nJudge:\nAgreed.\nByrde:\nThey're right, Mr. Wright! You have to check the Court Record before you answer! If you don't, your client might end up with a guilty verdict!\nPhoenix:\n(\"Your client\"? You do realize that's you, right?)\nJudge:\nI will ask you one more time.\nLeads back to:\n\"What was the piece of evidence found underneath the victim's body?\"Glasses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"That's simple, Your Honor. A broken pair of glasses.\"A police badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIf he's a cop, then I guess maybe a badge or something...\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nMr. Wright! Please stick to the facts of this case!\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe is a policeman, correct?\nPayne:\nI don't think you understand the problem here.\nJudge:\nI will not have an uninformed lawyer in my court.\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. (Guess there's no fooling those two.)\nByrde:\nPlease, for my sake, look at the Court Record, sir!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh, with [the R Button / Tab], right?) (Changed from [Uh, it's the Court Record Button, right?] in the original release)\nJudge:\nI will ask you one more time.\nLeads back to:\n\"What was the piece of evidence found underneath the victim's body?\"Phoenix:\nThat's simple, Your Honor. A broken pair of glasses.Judge:\nThat's right.Gumshoe:\nThe victim grabbed the criminal's glasses as he was being shoved, sir, and held onto them as he fell.Phoenix:\n...Byrde:\nHey! Why are you giving me the evil eye!?Phoenix:\nThose glasses you're wearing...Byrde:\nNnnngh... Yes, this is my spare pair. But these glasses they found at the scene of the crime are not mine! I swear, sir!Phoenix:\nYou sure about that?Byrde:\nLook, it was a coincidence that on that same day, I accidentally stepped on mine!Phoenix:\n(A \"coincidence\" she says... Urk...)Payne:\nEh hee hee hee hee hee hee! Your Honor. I have further evidence to present.Judge:\nOh? You have more?Payne:\nAnd this evidence is very decisive.Judge:\nVery well! Let's hear from our witness about this \"evidence\".Witness Testimony-- Decisive Evidence --Gumshoe:\nThere's something even more incriminating than the glasses under the victim's body, sir.\nDuring his date, the victim was pushed from the bench area.\nBut he managed to write the culprit's name on the ground where he landed.\nI don't like saying it, but it was clearly the defendant's name, \"Maggie\", sir.\nWith this piece of evidence and the glasses, it's hard to say she's not the culprit.Payne:\nThis is a picture of the writing, Your Honor.Judge:\nWhy, this is...! Yes, I can see the name is clearly written here.Payne:\nThe prosecution would like to submit this picture.Judge:\nUnderstood. The court accepts it into evidence.Crime Photo 2 added to the Court Record.Phoenix:\nAs if the glasses alone didn't make you look suspicious, the victim even wrote your name clear as day on the ground!Byrde:\nBut, but, but, I already told you! Those glasses aren't mine!!Phoenix:\nAnd how do you explain his dying message?Byrde:\n... It's a conspiracy! I'm not guilty, sir!Judge:\nMr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Phoenix:\nCross-examine?Byrde:\nThis is it! I'm counting on you!Phoenix:\nSure... But what am I supposed to do?Byrde:\nWHAT!? This isn't like you at all! Normally, this is the part where you get in the witnesses' faces!Phoenix:\nGet in their faces and do what?Byrde:\nI guess there's no way around it! OK, I'm going to lend you a hand! The prosecution's witnesses all hide things from the court, which means they lie from time to time.Phoenix:\nLie? But... isn't that detective your superior?Byrde:\nWell, even if they don't mean to lie, sometimes people just remember things wrong.Phoenix:\nHmm, like that detective. He does sort of look like a scatterbrain...Byrde:\nIt doesn't matter! Either way, it's bad for us, sir! That's why when you question witnesses, you have to find and expose their lies!Judge:\nMr. Wright. Your cross-examination, please.Phoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor. (Talk about trial by fire. Here goes nothing. As long as I can \"expose the lies\", we should be alright.)Cross Examination-- Decisive Evidence --Gumshoe:\nThere's something even more incriminating than the glasses under the victim's body, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHmm, about those glasses... Do you have any proof that those belong to my client?\nGumshoe:\nThe lenses are for near-sightedness, and are almost the same strength as hers. Even the frames look kinda like the ones she's wearing in her ID, pal.\nPhoenix:\nHmm... (What should I do now?)\n\n\n\nContinue pressing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Almost\" and \"kinda\" are not good enough in a case like this!\nGumshoe:\nEr, um...\nPhoenix:\nDo you have more definitive proof? Is there something that clearly links the defendant with those glasses!?\nGumshoe:\nEr, um, uh... The dirt and sand rubbed out any traces of fingerprints or anything else.\nPhoenix:\nSo what you are saying, detective, is that you have nothing that proves those glasses are my client's.\nGumshoe:\nUm, something like that...\nPayne:\nWh-Wh-What!?\nJudge:\nI see... Hmm... So there is no proof...\nByrde:\nWow, that was amazing! I could totally feel it, down in my gut!\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nLeave it be\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(We're in real trouble if those glasses really are hers... It's probably better to back out while we can.)\nByrde:\nArgh... Why don't you believe me...?\nLeads back to cross-examinationGumshoe:\nDuring his date, the victim was pushed from the bench area.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nNow, you're sure he was pushed and that's how he fell?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, pal. If you look at the wounds on the victim's body, there's no way it was anything else.\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\nJudge:\nPlease continue with your testimony, detective.\nGumshoe:\nAnyway, the victim fell pretty far...Gumshoe:\nBut he managed to write the culprit's name on the ground where he landed.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe culprit's name?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. I was surprised, too. I didn't want to believe it, but...\nPhoenix:\nWas the name that of my client?Present Maggey Byrde profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...\"Gumshoe:\nI don't like saying it, but it was clearly the defendant's name, \"Maggie\", sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely certain!?\nGumshoe:\nSorry, pal, but that's what it said. This is a picture of it. No matter which way you look, it still says \"Maggie\".\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... He's got a point...)\nByrde:\nHey, hold on!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nByrde:\nDon't \"huh\" me! I know the picture says \"Maggie\", but...\nPhoenix:\n(Now that she mentions it, something does feel kind of off about this picture...)\nByrde:\nThat's how you know you found a contradiction! Now hurry up and present some evidence!\nPhoenix:\n(So THAT'S what spotting a contradiction feels like... I'd better check the Court Record again...)Present Maggey Byrde profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...\"Gumshoe:\nWith this piece of evidence and the glasses, it's hard to say she's not the culprit.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd you are certain that it was the victim who wrote the name on the ground?\nGumshoe:\nThere were scratches on his fingers from the rough sand, and there were grains of sand stuck under his pointer finger nail.\nJudge:\nHmm... It certainly seems that the name was written by the victim himself.\nPhoenix:\n(That didn't go well. If it really was him, then we're in a lot of trouble...)Present Maggey Byrde profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...\"Byrde:\nDon't give up! Keep that fighting spirit going!Phoenix:\nI'm glad you're all pumped up, but...Byrde:\nI really want to see your \"special move\", sir!Phoenix:\nMy what??Byrde:\nYou always look so cool when you present evidence!Phoenix:\nPresent... evidence?Oh, THAT present evidence!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nActually, I was just thinking about that!\nByrde:\nYes! The great Phoenix Wright is back! Oh, that's right.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nByrde:\nI heard that lately, you can present not only evidence, but people's profiles as well! It sure makes things a bit more complicated, so be careful, sir!\nPhoenix:\n(People's profiles, huh? Alright, let's give this another try.)Enlighten me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm, about this \"presenting evidence\"...\nByrde:\nOK. When you're listening to testimony, you can compare, it with the Court Record. If you do that, you're sure to find contradictions in the witness's statements!\nPhoenix:\nC-Contradictions?\nByrde:\nWell, there are many reasons why a testimony might contradict the evidence. The witness might be lying, or maybe they're just mistaken.\nPhoenix:\nUh huh. And?\nByrde:\nYou still have no idea what I'm talking about?? When you find a contradiction, open the Court Record to the item you need...\nPhoenix:\nAnd then I present that evidence, right!?\nByrde:\nYou got it! You can also present people's profiles as evidence! With so many items, make sure you present the right thing!\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Sounds complicated, but I'll give it a try. You're pretty good at this.\nByrde:\nWow, being praised by a pro! I don't know what to say!Phoenix:\n... ... ...Judge:\nWh-What is it?Phoenix:\n... (What... What's come over me...? Without thinking, I just blurted out, \"Objection!\"... And I yelled it at the top of my lungs, finger outstretched, ready to take on my opponent! What a rush!) Detective Gumshoe!Gumshoe:\nY-You talking to me, pal?Phoenix:\nPlease state the defendant's name for me!Payne:Payne:\nWhat are you trying to prove with this futile exercise, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nYou'll see. This is a very crucial line of questioning! Actually, Mr. Payne, you can answer. The defendant's name, if you please.Payne:\nWh-Where is this ridiculous question coming from? The defendant's, uh, name is, uh... \"Maggie Byrde\".Phoenix:\nI think someone needs to check the Court Record.Payne:\nWhat...? It says right here that it's \"Maggey Byrde\". Aaaah!!Phoenix:\nIt looks like the bird caught the cat napping!Judge:\nWhat's going on here!?Gumshoe:\nI have no idea either, sir!Phoenix:\nAs you can see, the victim did indeed leave a name, \"Maggie\". However, the defendant's name is actually spelled, \"Maggey\"! This is a blatant contradiction of facts!Judge:\nOhh!Gumshoe:\nHow about that? I hadn't even noticed!Payne:Payne:\nBut, but, but...! But maybe the victim didn't know how to spell her name correctly...Phoenix:Phoenix:\nMay I remind you that it was you who said, \"The defendant is accused of killing her lover.\" If they were truly lovers, it would be impossible for him to have not known her name!Payne:\nNoooo!Judge:\nThis is very true. Mr. Payne.Payne:\nY-Yes, Your Honor?Judge:\nAre you absolutely certain that the defendant and the victim, Dustin Prince, were, in fact, lovers?Payne:\nY-Yes, I am quite certain, Your Honor. They were a well-known couple in the police force.Judge:\nDetective Gumshoe. Please testify for the court the relationship between the victim and the defendant.Gumshoe:\nYes, sir...Witness Testimony-- Dustin and Maggey --Gumshoe:\n{{tt|Officer Prince and Officer Byrde had been going out for about half a year.\nIt sounded like they were even talking about marriage.\nThe day of the incident just happened to be the victim's birthday, sir.\nMaggey... I mean Officer Byrde, had gotten Officer Prince a present.\nIt was something she had bought over 2 months ago.

You may cross-examine the witness, Mr. Wright.Cross Examination-- Dustin and Maggey --Gumshoe:\nOfficer Prince and Officer Byrde had been going out for about half a year.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow do you know about this?\nGumshoe:\nEvery year in March, we have a training camp for us cops. Officer Byrde was a rookie at the time, and she and Officer Prince seemed to hit it off.\nPhoenix:\n(They got close, I take it...)\nGumshoe:\nActually, I was supposed to go, too, but... I couldn't pay the deposit for the trip, so I didn't. If only I had gone on that trip...\nJudge:\nWhat is it?\nGumshoe:\nOh, uh, nothing, sir! Really! Anyway...Gumshoe:\nIt sounded like they were even talking about marriage.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nMarriage? But wasn't the victim 8 years older than her?\nGumshoe:\nWhat!? You saying a guy's gotta marry someone the same age as himself, pal!?\nPhoenix:\nNo, that's not what I meant at all...\nByrde:\nDetective Gumshoe and Dustin were only a year apart, you know?\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh... I think this fella has a ways to go before marriage...)\nGumshoe:\nMind your own business, pal!Gumshoe:\nThe day of the incident just happened to be the victim's birthday, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe day of the incident... You mean September 6th?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. The victim, Officer Prince, had just gotten off duty at 5:30 PM that day, and since Maggey's night shift hadn't started yet, they went to the park for a bit...\nJudge:\nAh, I remember when I was young and in love. Oh, it was a jolly time.\nPhoenix:\n(That's great, Your Honor... I'm glad you're such a cheerful old man...)Gumshoe:\nMaggey... I mean, Officer Byrde, had gotten Officer Prince a present.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n... You seem to know a lot about the defendant.\nGumshoe:\nWell, that's because, uh, I'm her boss. And I've gotta watch out for my subordinates!\nPhoenix:\nBut even what she was going to give as a present? Isn't that going a bit too far...?\nGumshoe:\nHey, pal! Watch what you say! I know everything that happens under me! If someone so much as scratches their...\nPhoenix:\nI REALLY don't need to know that much...\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nMr. Wright! Please refrain from badgering the witness!\nJudge:\nI agree. Even if this witness has a crush on the defendant, that should not be the point of discussion at this time.\nGumshoe:\nWhoa! Wait a second! Why are we talking about this!? It's all YOUR fault, pal! You're guilty, guilty, guilty! I should have you arrested!\nPhoenix:\n(I think the good Detective is about done here...)Gumshoe:\nIt was something she had bought over 2 months ago.

She's a very considerate woman, pal!\nPhoenix:\nSo... What was this birthday present?\nGumshoe:\nShe got him a glove.\nJudge:\nA single glove? Why would she only give him one?\nPayne:\nUm, actually, Your Honor, the glove in question is a baseball glove.\nJudge:\nOh, I see. A baseball glove.\nGumshoe:\nOfficer Prince was a huge baseball fan.\nPhoenix:\n(A baseball glove. Hmm...)\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nJust now, I believe you said that the present was something she had \"bought over 2 months ago\". (Changed from [she had \"gotten over 2 months ago\".] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nYeah.\nPhoenix:\nAre you saying she bought the glove at a store that far in advance? (Changed from [Are you saying she went out and bought the glove over 2 months ago?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nNah, nothing like that, pal!\nPhoenix:\nThen, what is it like?\nGumshoe:\nShe ordered it. It was custom-made!\nPhoenix:\nCustom-made? The glove was custom-made?\nGumshoe:\nYup, that's what I said!\nJudge:\nHmm... So the glove was custom-made.\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nYour Honor, I really don't see how this glove is related to this case.\nJudge:\nYes, it would seem that there is little relevance. What do you think, Mr. Wright? Do you think this glove is really relevant to this case?\n\n\n\nOf course it's relevant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"I don't know where this will lead me, but...\"\n\n\n\n\nOf course it's not\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHmm, I suppose it isn't really relevant.\nJudge:\nTh-Then...  Then why were you wasting this court's time with irrelevant questions!?\nPhoenix:\nUh, I was curious and got, uh, carried away, Your Honor...?\nJudge:\nWitness, please ignore this airheaded lawyer and continue with your testimony.\nPayne:\nDetective Gumshoe, please tell the court why you knew about the baseball glove.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave him be\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Well, it's just a birthday present...)\nPayne:\nIf there are no further questions, Your Honor... \nJudge:\nHmm...

There just wasn't anything that really stuck out as odd.Byrde:\nYeah... I wonder what would happen if you tried to get more information from him?Phoenix:\nGet more information?Byrde:\nYeah! You know! Like how they \"press\" people on those old cop shows, sir!Phoenix:\nSo I should try \"pressing\" him, huh?Phoenix:\n(I don't know where this will lead me, but...) Of course it is relevant! That glove is the key to this whole case!Byrde:\nYes! Bluffing to the max! Now, THIS is the Mr. Wright I know! I'm so happy you're back, sir! I was wondering how long it'd take! This is great!Phoenix:\n(Hmm, pressing people... It feels like I've done this before. As if I used to do this to squeeze information from even the most tight-lipped people.)Judge:\nVery well. If you are that convinced, then let's hear some more about this matter.Gumshoe:\nActually, I brought the glove with me today.Phoenix:\nAnd?Judge:\nWhy didn't you say so earlier? Hurry and show the glove to this court!Gumshoe:\nWell, I didn't think it had anything to do with this case... Anyway, this is it, sir.Judge:\nIt's, uh... rather yellow, isn't it?Baseball Glove added to the Court Record.Gumshoe:\nOfficer Prince really liked the color yellow.Phoenix:\nAnd that's why you had to special order it?Byrde:\nYup, that's right! That, and one other reason...Judge:\nI think this court has heard enough. It is clear that the victim and the defendant were involved with each other.Payne:\nYes, that's correct, Your Honor.Judge:\nNow, if that is true, it brings up an important question. Was the name \"Maggie\" really written by the victim?Payne:\nI see your point, Your Honor. Detective Gumshoe, please tell the court a little more about the name on the ground.Gumshoe:\nYes, sir.Witness Testimony-- Writing on the Ground --Gumshoe:\nWe first looked into the handwriting. (Changed from [We first looked into the handwriting, sir.] in the original release)\nUnfortunately, we couldn't confirm that it was the victim's handwriting.\nNext, we checked the victim's pointer finger.\nWe found out that there was sand trapped under the victim's fingernail.\nThere were also scratches on the skin that were caused by him writing on the ground.\nFrom this, we could confirm that the victim wrote this name with his right hand.Judge:\nHmm... Yes, a perfectly logical conclusion. Now then, Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Phoenix:\nThank you, Your Honor.Cross Examination-- Writing on the Ground --Gumshoe:\nWe first looked into the handwriting.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n \nPhoenix:\nBut can you really determine handwriting based on a sample written in sand? \nGumshoe:\nHeh, this is why amateurs are amateurs. We're not a buncha simpletons, pal! Scientific investigation in this country's actually pretty good. \nJudge:\nHmm, I believe it's time to get back to the real point. \nPayne:\nAgreed, Your Honor. So, what was the result of the investigation?Gumshoe:\nUnfortunately, we couldn't confirm that it was the victim's handwriting.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo in the end, you couldn't confirm it? \nGumshoe:\nHey, don't you look down on us! I told you! We're not a bunch of simpletons, pal! Everyone knows you can't find out everything you want with scientific investigation! \nJudge:\nI've never heard that before. \nPayne:\nMe, either. \nPhoenix:\nNor I. \nByrde:\nI never heard anything like that at the police academy, sir... \nGumshoe:\nOK, so I made it up. Anyway...Gumshoe:\nNext, we checked the victim's pointer finger.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHis pointer finger? \nGumshoe:\nYou know, the one you're always POINTING and waving around in people's faces. \nPhoenix:\nAha, ha, ha. Don't tell me it bothers you... \nGumshoe:\nEvery time you do it, I have a mini-heart attack. It's like you're trying to kill me, pal. \nPayne:\nIn any case, you examined the victim's index finger, correct? \nGumshoe:\nYeah. We figured there should be something on his finger if he had been writing in sand. \nJudge:\nHmm... And the results?Gumshoe:\nWe found that there was sand trapped under the victim's fingernail.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd what does that prove?\nGumshoe:\nWell, it proves that he did write that name with his own finger.\nPayne:\nYes, which explains why there was sand stuck under his nail.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess he's right...)\nGumshoe:\nAnd there's more...Gumshoe:\nThere were also scratches on the skin that were caused by him writing on the ground.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Scratches on his skin?\"\nGumshoe:\nYup. You can't see them with your naked eye, but they're there. \nJudge:\nThat is incredible! \nGumshoe:\nSure is! That's the power of scientific investigation! They're so small that we had to use a magnifying glass... like a really strong one. It's got that really scientific-sounding name... \nPhoenix:\nYou mean a microscope? \nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's it! We used one of those and that's how we found them! \nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe this guy doesn't know what a microscope is...)Gumshoe:\nFrom this, we could confirm that the victim wrote this name with his right hand.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely sure?\nGumshoe:\nI believe in the power of science.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, I wonder if my evidence is solid enough to counter with?)Present Baseball Glove\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Detective Gumshoe. Take a look at this.\"Phoenix:\n(Listening to this, you would think there was only one conclusion... that the name was definitely written by the victim...)Byrde:\nBut don't you think that would be really strange, sir!? If Dustin really wrote that message with his right hand, do you think I would have gone through that much trouble to get him his present?Phoenix:\n(The present...? What about it...?)Phoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe. Take a look at this.Gumshoe:\nThat's the glove, right?Phoenix:\nCould you tell the court what is special about this glove?Gumshoe:\nWhat's special? Um, never really thought about it, but uh... It's REALLY yellow... ... And that's about it.Phoenix:\nYes, it's REALLY yellow, but that is only one of its qualities.Gumshoe:\nHuh?Phoenix:\nThere's another reason why it's special.Judge:\nAnd what would that be?Phoenix:\nIt's very simple.Phoenix:\nThis glove is made for a left-handed person!Gumshoe:\nLeft-handed...?Judge:\nWhy, you're absolutely right! This glove is made to be worn on the right hand!Phoenix:\nThat is why it had to be custom-made. I have never seen a bright yellow left-hander's glove for sale. Have you?Gumshoe:\nWell, um... no.Phoenix:\nSo, Detective. Which hand did the victim use to write the name with, again...?Gumshoe:\nThat's easy! Look, it's obvious from this picture that it was his... W-W-Wait a sec...Phoenix:\nDon't forget that the victim was left-handed!Gumshoe:\nAaaaah!!Payne:Payne:\nThis is... This is... I mean... I... Objec--Judge:\nOverruled. Mr. Wright, I would like to know what your line of reasoning proves.Phoenix:\nThere is only one conclusion that can be drawn! A left-handed person could not have written a message with his right hand! Therefore! The person who wrote the name \"Maggie\" could not have been the victim!Judge:\nOrder! Order! When you think about it that way, then yes, it is not possible that this name was written by the victim himself.Gumshoe:\nThen that means Maggey is...!Payne:\nNo... IT'S NOT POSSIBLE!!Judge:\nMr. Payne.Payne:\nY-Y-Yes, Your Honor?Judge:\nThe evidence the prosecution has presented has failed to prove the defendant's guilt. In fact, I believe you have proven her to be innocent!Payne:\nNOOOOOOO!Byrde:\nAlright! You did it, Mr. Wright! Whew! I feel like I can breathe again!Judge:\nIt seems that we have reached the conclusion. You did a fine job once again, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nMe, Your Honor? Ah, well, thank you, sir...Byrde:\nSee, you got complimented by the judge again! You're really good! And that's why you can't give up being a lawyer, sir!Phoenix:\n(Are you joking!? I'm more than ready to retire!)Judge:\nI will now announce my verdict. This court finds the defendant, Maggey Byrde...Payne:Payne:\nNo!! Not yet! I mean, please give me a few more minutes, Your Honor.Judge:\nWh-What is the meaning of this, Mr. Payne!?Payne:\nThe prosecution is not finished yet!Phoenix:\nWhat do you mean!?Payne:\nWe would like to call our next witness to the stand!Phoenix:\nWhaaaaaaaaaat!?Judge:\nAnd what did this witness... witness?Payne:\nThe moment the victim was pushed to his death! What's more, he saw the very face of the culprit!Phoenix:\nWhat the heck!?Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! I believe a recess is in order. Afterward, we will hear from this new witness.Phoenix:\n(I had a feeling that was a bit too easy... Hmm, I need more information. I'll have to see what I can find out during this recess. I can't let my guard down! It's only going to get tougher from here!)Judge:\nCourt is adjourned for recess!To be continued.September 8, 11:43 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Byrde:\nA-Amnesia!? I can't believe my lawyer's trying to defend me in such a state...Phoenix:\n... I... Uh...Byrde:\nWhy didn't you tell me, sir!?Phoenix:\nI'm sorry I didn't mention it to you.Byrde:\nOh! I know what to do! I heard you can fix something like this with a really strong shock to your system! Come on, lower your head a little! A Maggey Kick should be all you need!Phoenix:\nAh, no, no, no. I think I'll pass on this one.Byrde:\nCome on! ... I-I'm sorry. (Changed from [Come on! ... Ah, I'm sorry.] in the original release) Whenever I see someone in trouble, I have a hard time leaving them alone... I tend to stick my nose where it doesn't belong and try to tackle everyone's problems.Phoenix:\n(Well, my head's one problem you won't be tackling today...) Well, we're here to solve your problem first. We can deal with mine later. For now, do you think you can fill me in on a few things?Byrde:\nOf course! I'd be honored to! Ah, well, I guess we'll start with my name and then I can tell you about me!Phoenix:\nNo, no, that's ok. Really. I think I know you and your name pretty well by now. I was wondering if you could help me figure out a few things about myself. So, my name is \"Phoenix Wright\"? What a weird name.Byrde:\nHmmmm... This is serious. You really don't remember. I'll tell you what, sir. You can have this back, and maybe it'll help!Phoenix:\n...? This is... a business card?Byrde:\nI got this from you. It's my most prized possession! You can borrow it for now, but please give it back, OK!?Phoenix:\nOK. (There are some numbers written on the back...)Byrde:\nOh, that's your cell phone number!Phoenix's Business Card added to the Court Record.Phoenix:\nI guess for now, we should stop talking about me, and start talking about this case.Byrde:\nThis case...?Phoenix:\nYup. Can you think of anything that would be helpful for me to know?Byrde:\nUm, what can I tell you...? Ah, um... Hmm... I can't think of anything other than the incident with that cell phone, but...Phoenix:\n...Cell phone?Byrde:\nYeah! Your eyes lit up when we talked about it at the Detention Center, sir!Phoenix:\n...!Phoenix:\nHurry up then and tell me! This might be very important!Byrde:\nOK! Roger! It was on the day of the crime, just before 6 PM... I picked up a lost cell phone while on a walk with Dustin.Phone:\n...............Byrde:\nAll of a sudden, the phone began to ring...Phone:\n...*beep*...Byrde:\n\"Um, hello?\"???:\n\"Oh, thank you! I've been searching for my phone.\"Byrde:\n\"Is this yours? Oh, I'm glad you called! We can meet up and I can give this back!\"???:\n\"I'll be right there, um... I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name...\"Byrde:\n\"You can call me Maggey!\"Byrde:\nWe agreed to meet up at 6 PM. Dustin and I waited for the person to show up... but they never did.Phoenix:\nHmmmm... So where is the phone you found now?Byrde:\nI gave it to you yesterday!Phoenix:\nHuh? To me? (Is it that phone in my pocket...?) Y-You mean this?Byrde:\nDo you think it has anything to do with the murder?Phoenix:\nI... don't really know... But if my eyes \"lit up\"...???:\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!! YOU WERE HERE ALL ALONG!! You're so mean!! I called you a million times but you wouldn't pick up! And when I went to check in the courtroom, everyone had already left...Phoenix:\n(Ack! Now who in the heck is this? Let me guess. I'm supposed to know this girl too...)???:\nHey, good morning, Maggey!Byrde:\nAnd a good morning to you, too, Maya!Maya:\nSo!? So!? How's it going!?Byrde:\nIs there a word for \"worse than abysmal\"...?Maya:\nOh? And what if I said that everything will be fine? That's right! It's Maya to the rescue with the ultra-decisive super-important evidence! Here you are, Nick! The thing you wanted me to bring!Phoenix:\nHuh? Oh, ah, thanks... (What the heck is this? A list? It has about 20 people's names and phone numbers written on it.)Maya:\nIt was kind of tough, but I managed to dig up some dirt! (Changed from [It was kind of tough, but I managed to find out some dirt!] in the original release) It looks like these guys are up to no good.Phoenix:\n\"No good\"? As in?Maya:\nThere's a group of con artists the police are currently investigating. I think these guys are members of that group.Names List added to the Court Record.Phoenix:\nWhy would a group of con artists pop up in a case like this?Maya:\nDon't look at me!Phoenix:\nHmm... And where did you get this list from in the first place?Maya:\nWhaaaaat!? Don't you remember, Nick!? (Changed from [Whaaaaat!? Why are you asking that!?] in the original release) You're the one who asked me to look this up yesterday!Phoenix:\nOh... is that right?Maya:\nThese numbers were in the memory of that phone Maggey found.Phoenix:\nHmm, so that's where they're from.Maya:\nYou're awfully forgetful these days, Nick. I hope I never get to be a forgetful old prune like you!Byrde:\nUm, Maya... Actually, Mr. Wright is...Bailiff:\nMr. Wright! Recess is now over. Please bring the defendant and return to the courtroom immediately!Maya:\nOh, oops! Guess you have to get going! We can talk about you being old later, Nick!Byrde:\nW-Wish us luck!Phoenix:\n(I guess I have all the pieces now... More or less. All that's left is to put it all together. I'm not going to lose this. I can't!)Maya:\nCome on, Nick. Better get a move on!Phoenix:\nY-Yeah.September 8, 11:54 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nThe court will now reconvene. Please call your next witness to the stand, Mr. Payne.Payne:\nYes, Your Honor. But before I do, if I may say a few words...Judge:\nWhat is it, Mr. Payne?Payne:\nIt's about the next witness. He has a tendency to say things that rub people the wrong way, you see, so I ask that the court might be a little lenient on...Judge:\nThere is no need to give a preface. Just hurry up and call your witness, please.Payne:\nY-Yes, Your Honor. ...The prosecution calls its next witness: a drifter who was taking a walk in the park on the day of the murder!Payne:\nPlease state your name for the court, witness.???:\nBefore I do, I'd like to clarify a little something.Payne:\nHuh? Oh, alright, go ahead.???:\nJust now, you introduced my wonderful self to the court, correct? Perhaps as a \"drifter who was taking a walk\"?Payne:\nD-Did I????:\nBut I will not stand for that! Now you've tinted the court's eyes and colored me wrongly. Sure, I suppose calling me a university student would not be the absolute truth, but to give in and just settle would be as evil as death and I can't have that! Everything in my life is to be of the utmost, highest, top grade quality, you understand. I am merely looking for that perfect, top notch, unbeatable university, don't you see...? I have a rigorous selection process and I was in serious thought during my \"walk\" as...Payne:\nYes, yes, I understand. I'm very sorry. I will be more careful from now on.Maya:\nWh-What is he? A human chatterbox?Phoenix:\nUgh... I have to question HIM????:\nFashion! Cars! Women! Glasses! And of course, University! First-rates only need apply!Phoenix:\n(Glasses...? But you aren't wearing glasses...)Judge:\nThat's enough! Your name, witness.???:\nOh? Is that how you want to play this? Using your power and influence to keep the young people down. I see how you work now. You old people and your dirty tricks. You thought you had me, but you thought wrong.Judge:\nI-I'm sorry. It won't happen again.Phoenix:\n(Oh man...)Wellington:\nI forgive you. Alright, I suppose I can tell you my name. I am Richard Wellington, the \"Drifting Virtuoso\" with a Ph.D. in Drifting, as it were. If you wanted to, you could call me a \"University Student in Transit\".Payne:\nAhem, Mr. Wellington. On the day of the murder, you were taking a... er, strolling through the park, correct?Wellington:\nIt would appear that you are attached to that word. If you must, then by all means. But I remind you that I am in no way a prepubescent boy, \"out on a walk\" with mommy. If you must know, I am--Payne:\nAnyway! Please testify to this court what you saw during your walk through the park!Wellington:\nSee, you said it again! \"Taking a walk\"... You know, you--Judge:\nWhat you witnessed will do, Mr. Wellington!Witness Testimony-- What I Saw That Day --Wellington:\nI was at the park all afternoon, deep in thought about my life situation.\nI don't remember the time all that well, but I do believe it was past 6 PM.\nAll of a sudden, a police officer falls from above, right in front of my eyes.\nWithout a thought, I looked up, and there I met the eyes of a charming, young lady.\nOf course I remember her sweet face. It was that of the pretty defendant there.\nThe only other thing I saw was the banana that fell with the police officer.Judge:\nHmm, that was certainly a decisive testimony.Maya:\nDecisive!? Nick, did you hear what he just said!?Phoenix:\nYeah.Maya:\nThat's all you have to say? How can you be so calm!?Phoenix:\n(It's strange... My mind is very calm and clear.) Maybe it's because I... believe in my client.Maya:\nYou mean Maggey?Phoenix:\nYes. And if she really is innocent, then that can only mean one thing: That guy is lying!Judge:\nYou may now question the witness, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\n(I'll find out the truth, no matter how well you craft your lies!)Cross Examination",
    "newContext": "-- Writing on the Ground --Gumshoe:\nWe first looked into the handwriting.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n \nPhoenix:\nBut can you really determine handwriting based on a sample written in sand? \nGumshoe:\nHeh, this is why amateurs are amateurs. We're not a buncha simpletons, pal! Scientific investigation in this country's actually pretty good. \nJudge:\nHmm, I believe it's time to get back to the real point. \nPayne:\nAgreed, Your Honor. So, what was the result of the investigation?Gumshoe:\nUnfortunately, we couldn't confirm that it was the victim's handwriting.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo in the end, you couldn't confirm it? \nGumshoe:\nHey, don't you look down on us! I told you! We're not a bunch of simpletons, pal! Everyone knows you can't find out everything you want with scientific investigation! \nJudge:\nI've never heard that before. \nPayne:\nMe, either. \nPhoenix:\nNor I. \nByrde:\nI never heard anything like that at the police academy, sir... \nGumshoe:\nOK, so I made it up. Anyway...Gumshoe:\nNext, we checked the victim's pointer finger.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHis pointer finger? \nGumshoe:\nYou know, the one you're always POINTING and waving around in people's faces. \nPhoenix:\nAha, ha, ha. Don't tell me it bothers you... \nGumshoe:\nEvery time you do it, I have a mini-heart attack. It's like you're trying to kill me, pal. \nPayne:\nIn any case, you examined the victim's index finger, correct? \nGumshoe:\nYeah. We figured there should be something on his finger if he had been writing in sand. \nJudge:\nHmm... And the results?Gumshoe:\nWe found that there was sand trapped under the victim's fingernail.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd what does that prove?\nGumshoe:\nWell, it proves that he did write that name with his own finger.\nPayne:\nYes, which explains why there was sand stuck under his nail.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess he's right...)\nGumshoe:\nAnd there's more...Gumshoe:\nThere were also scratches on the skin that were caused by him writing on the ground.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Scratches on his skin?\"\nGumshoe:\nYup. You can't see them with your naked eye, but they're there. \nJudge:\nThat is incredible! \nGumshoe:\nSure is! That's the power of scientific investigation! They're so small that we had to use a magnifying glass... like a really strong one. It's got that really scientific-sounding name... \nPhoenix:\nYou mean a microscope? \nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's it! We used one of those and that's how we found them! \nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe this guy doesn't know what a microscope is...)Gumshoe:\nFrom this, we could confirm that the victim wrote this name with his right hand.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely sure?\nGumshoe:\nI believe in the power of science.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, I wonder if my evidence is solid enough to counter with?)Present Baseball Glove\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Detective Gumshoe. Take a look at this.\"Phoenix:\n(Listening to this, you would think there was only one conclusion... that the name was definitely written by the victim...)Byrde:\nBut don't you think that would be really strange, sir!? If Dustin really wrote that message with his right hand, do you think I would have gone through that much trouble to get him his present?Phoenix:\n(The present...? What about it...?)Phoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe. Take a look at this.Gumshoe:\nThat's the glove, right?Phoenix:\nCould you tell the court what is special about this glove?Gumshoe:\nWhat's special? Um, never really thought about it, but uh... It's REALLY yellow... ... And that's about it.Phoenix:\nYes, it's REALLY yellow, but that is only one of its qualities.Gumshoe:\nHuh?Phoenix:\nThere's another reason why it's special.Judge:\nAnd what would that be?Phoenix:\nIt's very simple.Phoenix:\nThis glove is made for a left-handed person!Gumshoe:\nLeft-handed...?Judge:\nWhy, you're absolutely right! This glove is made to be worn on the right hand!Phoenix:\nThat is why it had to be custom-made. I have never seen a bright yellow left-hander's glove for sale. Have you?Gumshoe:\nWell, um... no.Phoenix:\nSo, Detective. Which hand did the victim use to write the name with, again...?Gumshoe:\nThat's easy! Look, it's obvious from this picture that it was his... W-W-Wait a sec...Phoenix:\nDon't forget that the victim was left-handed!Gumshoe:\nAaaaah!!Payne:Payne:\nThis is... This is... I mean... I... Objec--Judge:\nOverruled. Mr. Wright, I would like to know what your line of reasoning proves.Phoenix:\nThere is only one conclusion that can be drawn! A left-handed person could not have written a message with his right hand! Therefore! The person who wrote the name \"Maggie\" could not have been the victim!Judge:\nOrder! Order! When you think about it that way, then yes, it is not possible that this name was written by the victim himself.Gumshoe:\nThen that means Maggey is...!Payne:\nNo... IT'S NOT POSSIBLE!!Judge:\nMr. Payne.Payne:\nY-Y-Yes, Your Honor?Judge:\nThe evidence the prosecution has presented has failed to prove the defendant's guilt. In fact, I believe you have proven her to be innocent!Payne:\nNOOOOOOO!Byrde:\nAlright! You did it, Mr. Wright! Whew! I feel like I can breathe again!Judge:\nIt seems that we have reached the conclusion. You did a fine job once again, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nMe, Your Honor? Ah, well, thank you, sir...Byrde:\nSee, you got complimented by the judge again! You're really good! And that's why you can't give up being a lawyer, sir!Phoenix:\n(Are you joking!? I'm more than ready to retire!)Judge:\nI will now announce my verdict. This court finds the defendant, Maggey Byrde...Payne:Payne:\nNo!! Not yet! I mean, please give me a few more minutes, Your Honor.Judge:\nWh-What is the meaning of this, Mr. Payne!?Payne:\nThe prosecution is not finished yet!Phoenix:\nWhat do you mean!?Payne:\nWe would like to call our next witness to the stand!Phoenix:\nWhaaaaaaaaaat!?Judge:\nAnd what did this witness... witness?Payne:\nThe moment the victim was pushed to his death! What's more, he saw the very face of the culprit!Phoenix:\nWhat the heck!?Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! I believe a recess is in order. Afterward, we will hear from this new witness.Phoenix:\n(I had a feeling that was a bit too easy... Hmm, I need more information. I'll have to see what I can find out during this recess. I can't let my guard down! It's only going to get tougher from here!)Judge:\nCourt is adjourned for recess!To be continued.September 8, 11:43 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Byrde:\nA-Amnesia!? I can't believe my lawyer's trying to defend me in such a state...Phoenix:\n... I... Uh...Byrde:\nWhy didn't you tell me, sir!?Phoenix:\nI'm sorry I didn't mention it to you.Byrde:\nOh! I know what to do! I heard you can fix something like this with a really strong shock to your system! Come on, lower your head a little! A Maggey Kick should be all you need!Phoenix:\nAh, no, no, no. I think I'll pass on this one.Byrde:\nCome on! ... I-I'm sorry. (Changed from [Come on! ... Ah, I'm sorry.] in the original release) Whenever I see someone in trouble, I have a hard time leaving them alone... I tend to stick my nose where it doesn't belong and try to tackle everyone's problems.Phoenix:\n(Well, my head's one problem you won't be tackling today...) Well, we're here to solve your problem first. We can deal with mine later. For now, do you think you can fill me in on a few things?Byrde:\nOf course! I'd be honored to! Ah, well, I guess we'll start with my name and then I can tell you about me!Phoenix:\nNo, no, that's ok. Really. I think I know you and your name pretty well by now. I was wondering if you could help me figure out a few things about myself. So, my name is \"Phoenix Wright\"? What a weird name.Byrde:\nHmmmm... This is serious. You really don't remember. I'll tell you what, sir. You can have this back, and maybe it'll help!Phoenix:\n...? This is... a business card?Byrde:\nI got this from you. It's my most prized possession! You can borrow it for now, but please give it back, OK!?Phoenix:\nOK. (There are some numbers written on the back...)Byrde:\nOh, that's your cell phone number!Phoenix's Business Card added to the Court Record.Phoenix:\nI guess for now, we should stop talking about me, and start talking about this case.Byrde:\nThis case...?Phoenix:\nYup. Can you think of anything that would be helpful for me to know?Byrde:\nUm, what can I tell you...? Ah, um... Hmm... I can't think of anything other than the incident with that cell phone, but...Phoenix:\n...Cell phone?Byrde:\nYeah! Your eyes lit up when we talked about it at the Detention Center, sir!Phoenix:\n...!Phoenix:\nHurry up then and tell me! This might be very important!Byrde:\nOK! Roger! It was on the day of the crime, just before 6 PM... I picked up a lost cell phone while on a walk with Dustin.Phone:\n...............Byrde:\nAll of a sudden, the phone began to ring...Phone:\n...*beep*...Byrde:\n\"Um, hello?\"???:\n\"Oh, thank you! I've been searching for my phone.\"Byrde:\n\"Is this yours? Oh, I'm glad you called! We can meet up and I can give this back!\"???:\n\"I'll be right there, um... I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name...\"Byrde:\n\"You can call me Maggey!\"Byrde:\nWe agreed to meet up at 6 PM. Dustin and I waited for the person to show up... but they never did.Phoenix:\nHmmmm... So where is the phone you found now?Byrde:\nI gave it to you yesterday!Phoenix:\nHuh? To me? (Is it that phone in my pocket...?) Y-You mean this?Byrde:\nDo you think it has anything to do with the murder?Phoenix:\nI... don't really know... But if my eyes \"lit up\"...???:\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!! YOU WERE HERE ALL ALONG!! You're so mean!! I called you a million times but you wouldn't pick up! And when I went to check in the courtroom, everyone had already left...Phoenix:\n(Ack! Now who in the heck is this? Let me guess. I'm supposed to know this girl too...)???:\nHey, good morning, Maggey!Byrde:\nAnd a good morning to you, too, Maya!Maya:\nSo!? So!? How's it going!?Byrde:\nIs there a word for \"worse than abysmal\"...?Maya:\nOh? And what if I said that everything will be fine? That's right! It's Maya to the rescue with the ultra-decisive super-important evidence! Here you are, Nick! The thing you wanted me to bring!Phoenix:\nHuh? Oh, ah, thanks... (What the heck is this? A list? It has about 20 people's names and phone numbers written on it.)Maya:\nIt was kind of tough, but I managed to dig up some dirt! (Changed from [It was kind of tough, but I managed to find out some dirt!] in the original release) It looks like these guys are up to no good.Phoenix:\n\"No good\"? As in?Maya:\nThere's a group of con artists the police are currently investigating. I think these guys are members of that group.Names List added to the Court Record.Phoenix:\nWhy would a group of con artists pop up in a case like this?Maya:\nDon't look at me!Phoenix:\nHmm... And where did you get this list from in the first place?Maya:\nWhaaaaat!? Don't you remember, Nick!? (Changed from [Whaaaaat!? Why are you asking that!?] in the original release) You're the one who asked me to look this up yesterday!Phoenix:\nOh... is that right?Maya:\nThese numbers were in the memory of that phone Maggey found.Phoenix:\nHmm, so that's where they're from.Maya:\nYou're awfully forgetful these days, Nick. I hope I never get to be a forgetful old prune like you!Byrde:\nUm, Maya... Actually, Mr. Wright is...Bailiff:\nMr. Wright! Recess is now over. Please bring the defendant and return to the courtroom immediately!Maya:\nOh, oops! Guess you have to get going! We can talk about you being old later, Nick!Byrde:\nW-Wish us luck!Phoenix:\n(I guess I have all the pieces now... More or less. All that's left is to put it all together. I'm not going to lose this. I can't!)Maya:\nCome on, Nick. Better get a move on!Phoenix:\nY-Yeah.September 8, 11:54 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nThe court will now reconvene. Please call your next witness to the stand, Mr. Payne.Payne:\nYes, Your Honor. But before I do, if I may say a few words...Judge:\nWhat is it, Mr. Payne?Payne:\nIt's about the next witness. He has a tendency to say things that rub people the wrong way, you see, so I ask that the court might be a little lenient on...Judge:\nThere is no need to give a preface. Just hurry up and call your witness, please.Payne:\nY-Yes, Your Honor. ...The prosecution calls its next witness: a drifter who was taking a walk in the park on the day of the murder!Payne:\nPlease state your name for the court, witness.???:\nBefore I do, I'd like to clarify a little something.Payne:\nHuh? Oh, alright, go ahead.???:\nJust now, you introduced my wonderful self to the court, correct? Perhaps as a \"drifter who was taking a walk\"?Payne:\nD-Did I????:\nBut I will not stand for that! Now you've tinted the court's eyes and colored me wrongly. Sure, I suppose calling me a university student would not be the absolute truth, but to give in and just settle would be as evil as death and I can't have that! Everything in my life is to be of the utmost, highest, top grade quality, you understand. I am merely looking for that perfect, top notch, unbeatable university, don't you see...? I have a rigorous selection process and I was in serious thought during my \"walk\" as...Payne:\nYes, yes, I understand. I'm very sorry. I will be more careful from now on.Maya:\nWh-What is he? A human chatterbox?Phoenix:\nUgh... I have to question HIM????:\nFashion! Cars! Women! Glasses! And of course, University! First-rates only need apply!Phoenix:\n(Glasses...? But you aren't wearing glasses...)Judge:\nThat's enough! Your name, witness.???:\nOh? Is that how you want to play this? Using your power and influence to keep the young people down.

You can't run forever, Mr. Phoenix Wright!Phoenix:\nWha...!? What have I done wrong!?I cannot allow you to go on like this!Phoenix:\n...? B-But I'm just a simple defense attorney!Silence! You are no longer worthy of your title.September 8, 9:08 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Phoenix:\nWhat a nightmare... And I bet it was this ringtone that caused it... I really shouldn't be dozing off right before a trial starts anyway...Phone:\n...*beep*...Phoenix: \nHuh... looks like they hung up.???:\nAh, good. I finally found it. Talk about a close call. I hate to do this to you, but... It's nothing personal... Mr. Attorney.A few minutes later...District CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Phoenix:\n... Ouch... My head... It's throbbing... And why does it feel... so foggy in there...????: \nGooood morning!Phoenix: \nAck! Uh... G-Good morning...???: \nWhat's wrong!? You don't look well! People are at their best first thing in the morning! Where's that fighting spirit!?Phoenix: \n... Sorry, but can you please turn the cheeriness down? My head... sort of hurts...???: \nRoger that!Phoenix: \n...???: \n...Phoenix: \n... Um... Am I in trouble or something????: \nHuh? \"Trouble...?\"Phoenix: \nW-Wait, never mind. You're a policewoman, right? I thought maybe I had done something wrong...????: \nWh-What are you talking about? I'm the one in trouble!Phoenix: \n... What?Byrde: \nI'm placing my life in your hands today, Mr. Phoenix Wright!Phoenix: \nLife... in... my hands...?Byrde: \nYou promised me! You said you would prove that I was not guilty!Phoenix: \n\"N... Not... guilty\"?Byrde: \nJust when I thought all hope was lost; when all the other lawyers had laughed me off... \"Leave it to me!\" you said! You! The one and only Phoenix Wright came to save the day! And just like that, I was moved to tears, sir! I'll never forget what you're doing for me, EVER!Phoenix:\n(What is this girl babbling about...?)Byrde: \nActually, I really love to watch court proceedings, and I always root for you to win! When I'm off duty, I like to come here and... ...? What's wrong? You've been acting really strange and you keep staring at me. You're making me kind of nervous, sir...Phoenix: \nOh... sorry. (Hmm... I'm afraid to ask, but here goes...) So, this might sound bad, but... uh... Who are you...?Byrde: \nWhaaaaat!? Mr. Wright!! How can you say that!? How can you do this to the fragile heart of a girl about to go on trial...? You're absolutely horrible!Phoenix: \nNo -- I mean, I didn't mean it like that!Byrde:\nIs this how a defense attorney treats his clients, sir!? I can't believe this!!Phoenix:\nNo, it's just... ...Well, I think you have the wrong person. I'm...Byrde:\nYes...!? \"I'm...\"!?Phoenix: \n... ... I'm... Who am I? (Why am I drawing a blank...?)Bailiff:\nThe trial will begin shortly. Will the defendant and her lawyer please proceed to the courtroom immediately!Byrde: \nThe trial's about to start! I'm counting on you in there, OK?Phoenix: \n(Hmm... I guess I must have amnesia... Let's see... What can I piece together...? Hmm, from our conversation, I can safely say that I'm probably a defense attorney. And that girl... I said I'd prove her \"not guilty\"... I can't believe I made such an irresponsible promise.) Aaaaaargh! Someone, please!! Tell me this is just a bad dream!(Why do I get the feeling this is one dream I won't be waking up from...? *gulp*)September 8, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Maggey Byrde.Payne:\nThe prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:\n...Judge:\nWhat is it, Mr. Wright?Phoenix: \nUm, er... Are you talking to me...?Judge: \nDo you see any other defense attorneys here?Phoenix: \n(I guess not.) (Changed from [I guess not. Urk.] in the original release)Judge: \nNow then, are you ready?Yes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I should say, \"Yes\" for now.)\nJudge: \nAre you ready, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix: \nYes, Your Honor. (... Wait a sec... If her life is in my hands... I should really do the responsible thing...)\nLeads to:\n\"Actually, you see, Your Honor... My memory is kind of...\"No\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... What if I said, \"No\"? Would that be alright?\nJudge:\nOf course it wouldn't!\nPhoenix:\n(Then why bother asking to begin with??)\nLeads to:\n\"Actually, you see, Your Honor... My memory is kind of...\"Phoenix:\nActually, you see, Your Honor... My memory is kind of...Judge:\nThe court will not hear the defense's excuses. Because the defendant is a member of the police, this case is under great scrutiny. Therefore, we must make this trial fair but swift. I believe I have told you this before. I hope you're not telling me you've forgotten!Phoenix:\n(Actually, I have...) (Changed from [Actually, I did...] in the original release)Judge:\nMr. Payne, your opening statement, please.Payne:\nYes, Your Honor. As I'm sure you're well aware, the defendant is accused of killing her lover. What's worse, her lover was a fellow police officer!Phoenix:\nA policeman? You did WHAT to a policeman!?Byrde:\nIt wasn't me! And besides, Dustin and I... We weren't \"lovers\" like that!Payne:\nIn any case... The prosecution will prove that the guilty party is none other than the defendant!Judge:\nVery well. Mr. Payne, please call your first witness.Payne:\nHee, hee, hee. It's been a while, Mr. Wright. Let's see what you've learned since last time. I won't show you any mercy this time, rookie!Phoenix:\nOkaaay... (And who are you again!?)Payne:\nThe prosecution calls Detective Dick Gumshoe to the stand. (Changed from [Please bring Detective Dick Gumshoe to the stand.] in the original release)Byrde:\nHere we go! Don't let me down, Mr. Wright!Phoenix:\n(Nowhere to hide... I'm sooo dead...)Payne:\nWitness, please state your name and occupation.Gumshoe:\nMy name is Dick Gumshoe, sir. I'm the detective in charge of homicides down at the precinct, sir.Judge:\nYou don't look very well, Detective.Gumshoe:\nWell, sir, the defendant... She works under me, so, you know...Phoenix:\nYou work under that detective?Byrde:\nYes, sir! And while I was a trainee, he was always watching out for me, sir! He's such a wonderful guy, sir! I'll never forget what he's done for me!Phoenix:\n(OK, calm down, I believe you.)Payne:\nDetective Gumshoe. Please describe for us the details of this murder.Gumshoe:\nYes, sir. It happened at the park near headquarters, \"Expos√© Park\". The victim was one of the local cops, Dustin Prince. He was pushed down from the benches on the upper path, sir. The landing beat his body up bad and snapped his neck.Payne:\nThe details are listed in the report that was distributed yesterday...Judge:\nAh, yes. This autopsy report, correct?Phoenix:\n(Why do I not remember getting a copy...?)Judge:\nI see everything is in order here. Even the estimated time of death is unusually well documented!Gumshoe:\nThe victim's watch stopped from the impact of the landing, sir. The results of the autopsy confirmed the time of death.Payne:\nIf I may, Your Honor, the prosecution would like to submit this photograph.Judge:\nVery well. The court accepts it into evidence.Crime Photo 1 added to the Court Record.Judge:\nNow then, I recall at yesterday's preliminary hearing, a very important piece of evidence was brought to our attention.Payne:\nYes, Your Honor.Gumshoe:\nYes, sir.Phoenix:\nYes... I guess?Judge:\nMr. Wright! Is your head on right today!? There was a very crucial piece of evidence found under the victim's body!Phoenix:\nUm, was there?Byrde:\nHave you lost your mind!?Phoenix:\nWell, actually... Um, it's just nerves. Give me a second.Byrde:\nWhaaaat!? How can you talk like such an amateur!? I thought you were a pro, sir! ... Alright, sir. I'll help you through this! At a time like this, maybe you ought to take a glance at the Court Record!Phoenix:\n...Court Record?Byrde:\nYup! Info about evidence and people involved with this case are all listed there, sir! You can look a the Court Record by pressing [the R Button / Tab]! (Changed from [You can look at the Court Record by touching the Court Record Button!] in the original release)Phoenix:\n[The R Button / Tab], huh... You really know what you're talking about, don't you? (Changed from [The Court Record Button...? You really know what you're talking about, huh?] in the original release)Byrde:\nIt's too bad I'm a cop, right? Just think! I could totally be a legal aide instead!Judge:\nMr. Wright.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor!Judge:\nCourt is in session. Save your chit-chat for later!Phoenix:\nS-Sorry, Your Honor... (Well, I guess I'd better check the Court Record, and see what I can find... What was it again? [The R Button / Tab]...? (Changed from [What was it again? The Court Record Button...?] in the original release))Judge:\nAlright, Mr. Wright. Let's see if your notes are in order. What was the piece of evidence found underneath the victim's body?A wallet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... I'm pretty sure it was a wallet...\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nThis is a court of law! You can't just make wild guesses!\nJudge:\nAgreed.\nByrde:\nThey're right, Mr. Wright! You have to check the Court Record before you answer! If you don't, your client might end up with a guilty verdict!\nPhoenix:\n(\"Your client\"? You do realize that's you, right?)\nJudge:\nI will ask you one more time.\nLeads back to:\n\"What was the piece of evidence found underneath the victim's body?\"Glasses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"That's simple, Your Honor. A broken pair of glasses.\"A police badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIf he's a cop, then I guess maybe a badge or something...\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nMr. Wright! Please stick to the facts of this case!\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe is a policeman, correct?\nPayne:\nI don't think you understand the problem here.\nJudge:\nI will not have an uninformed lawyer in my court.\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. (Guess there's no fooling those two.)\nByrde:\nPlease, for my sake, look at the Court Record, sir!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh, with [the R Button / Tab], right?) (Changed from [Uh, it's the Court Record Button, right?] in the original release)\nJudge:\nI will ask you one more time.\nLeads back to:\n\"What was the piece of evidence found underneath the victim's body?\"Phoenix:\nThat's simple, Your Honor. A broken pair of glasses.Judge:\nThat's right.Gumshoe:\nThe victim grabbed the criminal's glasses as he was being shoved, sir, and held onto them as he fell.Phoenix:\n...Byrde:\nHey! Why are you giving me the evil eye!?Phoenix:\nThose glasses you're wearing...Byrde:\nNnnngh... Yes, this is my spare pair. But these glasses they found at the scene of the crime are not mine! I swear, sir!Phoenix:\nYou sure about that?Byrde:\nLook, it was a coincidence that on that same day, I accidentally stepped on mine!Phoenix:\n(A \"coincidence\" she says... Urk...)Payne:\nEh hee hee hee hee hee hee! Your Honor. I have further evidence to present.Judge:\nOh? You have more?Payne:\nAnd this evidence is very decisive.Judge:\nVery well! Let's hear from our witness about this \"evidence\".Witness Testimony-- Decisive Evidence --Gumshoe:\nThere's something even more incriminating than the glasses under the victim's body, sir.\nDuring his date, the victim was pushed from the bench area.\nBut he managed to write the culprit's name on the ground where he landed.\nI don't like saying it, but it was clearly the defendant's name, \"Maggie\", sir.\nWith this piece of evidence and the glasses, it's hard to say she's not the culprit.Payne:\nThis is a picture of the writing, Your Honor.Judge:\nWhy, this is...! Yes, I can see the name is clearly written here.Payne:\nThe prosecution would like to submit this picture.Judge:\nUnderstood. The court accepts it into evidence.Crime Photo 2 added to the Court Record.Phoenix:\nAs if the glasses alone didn't make you look suspicious, the victim even wrote your name clear as day on the ground!Byrde:\nBut, but, but, I already told you! Those glasses aren't mine!!Phoenix:\nAnd how do you explain his dying message?Byrde:\n... It's a conspiracy! I'm not guilty, sir!Judge:\nMr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Phoenix:\nCross-examine?Byrde:\nThis is it! I'm counting on you!Phoenix:\nSure... But what am I supposed to do?Byrde:\nWHAT!? This isn't like you at all! Normally, this is the part where you get in the witnesses' faces!Phoenix:\nGet in their faces and do what?Byrde:\nI guess there's no way around it! OK, I'm going to lend you a hand! The prosecution's witnesses all hide things from the court, which means they lie from time to time.Phoenix:\nLie? But... isn't that detective your superior?Byrde:\nWell, even if they don't mean to lie, sometimes people just remember things wrong.Phoenix:\nHmm, like that detective. He does sort of look like a scatterbrain...Byrde:\nIt doesn't matter! Either way, it's bad for us, sir! That's why when you question witnesses, you have to find and expose their lies!Judge:\nMr. Wright. Your cross-examination, please.Phoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor. (Talk about trial by fire. Here goes nothing. As long as I can \"expose the lies\", we should be alright.)Cross Examination-- Decisive Evidence --Gumshoe:\nThere's something even more incriminating than the glasses under the victim's body, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHmm, about those glasses... Do you have any proof that those belong to my client?\nGumshoe:\nThe lenses are for near-sightedness, and are almost the same strength as hers. Even the frames look kinda like the ones she's wearing in her ID, pal.\nPhoenix:\nHmm... (What should I do now?)\n\n\n\nContinue pressing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Almost\" and \"kinda\" are not good enough in a case like this!\nGumshoe:\nEr, um...\nPhoenix:\nDo you have more definitive proof? Is there something that clearly links the defendant with those glasses!?\nGumshoe:\nEr, um, uh... The dirt and sand rubbed out any traces of fingerprints or anything else.\nPhoenix:\nSo what you are saying, detective, is that you have nothing that proves those glasses are my client's.\nGumshoe:\nUm, something like that...\nPayne:\nWh-Wh-What!?\nJudge:\nI see... Hmm... So there is no proof...\nByrde:\nWow, that was amazing! I could totally feel it, down in my gut!\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nLeave it be\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(We're in real trouble if those glasses really are hers... It's probably better to back out while we can.)\nByrde:\nArgh... Why don't you believe me...?\nLeads back to cross-examinationGumshoe:\nDuring his date, the victim was pushed from the bench area.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nNow, you're sure he was pushed and that's how he fell?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, pal. If you look at the wounds on the victim's body, there's no way it was anything else.\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\nJudge:\nPlease continue with your testimony, detective.\nGumshoe:\nAnyway, the victim fell pretty far...Gumshoe:\nBut he managed to write the culprit's name on the ground where he landed.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe culprit's name?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. I was surprised, too. I didn't want to believe it, but...\nPhoenix:\nWas the name that of my client?Present Maggey Byrde profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...\"Gumshoe:\nI don't like saying it, but it was clearly the defendant's name, \"Maggie\", sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely certain!?\nGumshoe:\nSorry, pal, but that's what it said. This is a picture of it. No matter which way you look, it still says \"Maggie\".\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... He's got a point...)\nByrde:\nHey, hold on!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nByrde:\nDon't \"huh\" me! I know the picture says \"Maggie\", but...\nPhoenix:\n(Now that she mentions it, something does feel kind of off about this picture...)\nByrde:\nThat's how you know you found a contradiction! Now hurry up and present some evidence!\nPhoenix:\n(So THAT'S what spotting a contradiction feels like... I'd better check the Court Record again...)Present Maggey Byrde profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...\"Gumshoe:\nWith this piece of evidence and the glasses, it's hard to say she's not the culprit.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd you are certain that it was the victim who wrote the name on the ground?\nGumshoe:\nThere were scratches on his fingers from the rough sand, and there were grains of sand stuck under his pointer finger nail.\nJudge:\nHmm... It certainly seems that the name was written by the victim himself.\nPhoenix:\n(That didn't go well. If it really was him, then we're in a lot of trouble...)Present Maggey Byrde profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...\"Byrde:\nDon't give up! Keep that fighting spirit going!Phoenix:\nI'm glad you're all pumped up, but...Byrde:\nI really want to see your \"special move\", sir!Phoenix:\nMy what??Byrde:\nYou always look so cool when you present evidence!Phoenix:\nPresent... evidence?Oh, THAT present evidence!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nActually, I was just thinking about that!\nByrde:\nYes! The great Phoenix Wright is back! Oh, that's right.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nByrde:\nI heard that lately, you can present not only evidence, but people's profiles as well! It sure makes things a bit more complicated, so be careful, sir!\nPhoenix:\n(People's profiles, huh? Alright, let's give this another try.)Enlighten me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm, about this \"presenting evidence\"...\nByrde:\nOK. When you're listening to testimony, you can compare, it with the Court Record. If you do that, you're sure to find contradictions in the witness's statements!\nPhoenix:\nC-Contradictions?\nByrde:\nWell, there are many reasons why a testimony might contradict the evidence. The witness might be lying, or maybe they're just mistaken.\nPhoenix:\nUh huh. And?\nByrde:\nYou still have no idea what I'm talking about?? When you find a contradiction, open the Court Record to the item you need...\nPhoenix:\nAnd then I present that evidence, right!?\nByrde:\nYou got it! You can also present people's profiles as evidence! With so many items, make sure you present the right thing!\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Sounds complicated, but I'll give it a try. You're pretty good at this.\nByrde:\nWow, being praised by a pro! I don't know what to say!Phoenix:\n... ... ...Judge:\nWh-What is it?Phoenix:\n... (What... What's come over me...? Without thinking, I just blurted out, \"Objection!\"... And I yelled it at the top of my lungs, finger outstretched, ready to take on my opponent! What a rush!) Detective Gumshoe!Gumshoe:\nY-You talking to me, pal?Phoenix:\nPlease state the defendant's name for me!Payne:Payne:\nWhat are you trying to prove with this futile exercise, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nYou'll see. This is a very crucial line of questioning! Actually, Mr. Payne, you can answer. The defendant's name, if you please.Payne:\nWh-Where is this ridiculous question coming from? The defendant's, uh, name is, uh... \"Maggie Byrde\".Phoenix:\nI think someone needs to check the Court Record.Payne:\nWhat...? It says right here that it's \"Maggey Byrde\". Aaaah!!Phoenix:\nIt looks like the bird caught the cat napping!Judge:\nWhat's going on here!?Gumshoe:\nI have no idea either, sir!Phoenix:\nAs you can see, the victim did indeed leave a name, \"Maggie\". However, the defendant's name is actually spelled, \"Maggey\"! This is a blatant contradiction of facts!Judge:\nOhh!Gumshoe:\nHow about that? I hadn't even noticed!Payne:Payne:\nBut, but, but...! But maybe the victim didn't know how to spell her name correctly...Phoenix:Phoenix:\nMay I remind you that it was you who said, \"The defendant is accused of killing her lover.\" If they were truly lovers, it would be impossible for him to have not known her name!Payne:\nNoooo!Judge:\nThis is very true. Mr. Payne.Payne:\nY-Yes, Your Honor?Judge:\nAre you absolutely certain that the defendant and the victim, Dustin Prince, were, in fact, lovers?Payne:\nY-Yes, I am quite certain, Your Honor. They were a well-known couple in the police force.Judge:\nDetective Gumshoe. Please testify for the court the relationship between the victim and the defendant.Gumshoe:\nYes, sir...Witness Testimony-- Dustin and Maggey --Gumshoe:\n{{tt|Officer Prince and Officer Byrde had been going out for about half a year.\nIt sounded like they were even talking about marriage.\nThe day of the incident just happened to be the victim's birthday, sir.\nMaggey... I mean Officer Byrde, had gotten Officer Prince a present.\nIt was something she had bought over 2 months ago. (Changed from [It was something she had gotten over 2 months ago.] in the original release)\nI should know, 'cause she came to me to ask what she should get for him.Judge:\nOh... Those two sound like they were close...Payne:\nNevertheless, tragedy struck.Judge:\nHmm, yes, I see... You may cross-examine the witness, Mr. Wright.Cross Examination-- Dustin and Maggey --Gumshoe:\nOfficer Prince and Officer Byrde had been going out for about half a year.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow do you know about this?\nGumshoe:\nEvery year in March, we have a training camp for us cops. Officer Byrde was a rookie at the time, and she and Officer Prince seemed to hit it off.\nPhoenix:\n(They got close, I take it...)\nGumshoe:\nActually, I was supposed to go, too, but... I couldn't pay the deposit for the trip, so I didn't. If only I had gone on that trip...\nJudge:\nWhat is it?\nGumshoe:\nOh, uh, nothing, sir! Really! Anyway...Gumshoe:\nIt sounded like they were even talking about marriage.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nMarriage? But wasn't the victim 8 years older than her?\nGumshoe:\nWhat!? You saying a guy's gotta marry someone the same age as himself, pal!?\nPhoenix:\nNo, that's not what I meant at all...\nByrde:\nDetective Gumshoe and Dustin were only a year apart, you know?\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh... I think this fella has a ways to go before marriage...)\nGumshoe:\nMind your own business, pal!Gumshoe:\nThe day of the incident just happened to be the victim's birthday, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe day of the incident... You mean September 6th?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. The victim, Officer Prince, had just gotten off duty at 5:30 PM that day, and since Maggey's night shift hadn't started yet, they went to the park for a bit...\nJudge:\nAh, I remember when I was young and in love. Oh, it was a jolly time.\nPhoenix:\n(That's great, Your Honor... I'm glad you're such a cheerful old man...)Gumshoe:\nMaggey... I mean, Officer Byrde, had gotten Officer Prince a present.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n... You seem to know a lot about the defendant.\nGumshoe:\nWell, that's because, uh, I'm her boss. And I've gotta watch out for my subordinates!\nPhoenix:\nBut even what she was going to give as a present? Isn't that going a bit too far...?\nGumshoe:\nHey, pal! Watch what you say! I know everything that happens under me! If someone so much as scratches their...\nPhoenix:\nI REALLY don't need to know that much...\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nMr. Wright! Please refrain from badgering the witness!\nJudge:\nI agree. Even if this witness has a crush on the defendant, that should not be the point of discussion at this time.\nGumshoe:\nWhoa! Wait a second! Why are we talking about this!? It's all YOUR fault, pal! You're guilty, guilty, guilty! I should have you arrested!\nPhoenix:\n(I think the good Detective is about done here...)Gumshoe:\nIt was something she had bought over 2 months ago. (Changed from [It was something she had gotten over 2 months ago.] in the original release)Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Over 2 months ago?\"\nGumshoe:\nYup. She's a very considerate woman, pal!\nPhoenix:\nSo... What was this birthday present?\nGumshoe:\nShe got him a glove.\nJudge:\nA single glove? Why would she only give him one?\nPayne:\nUm, actually, Your Honor, the glove in question is a baseball glove.\nJudge:\nOh, I see. A baseball glove.\nGumshoe:\nOfficer Prince was a huge baseball fan.\nPhoenix:\n(A baseball glove. Hmm...)\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nJust now, I believe you said that the present was something she had \"bought over 2 months ago\". (Changed from [she had \"gotten over 2 months ago\".] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nYeah.\nPhoenix:\nAre you saying she bought the glove at a store that far in advance? (Changed from [Are you saying she went out and bought the glove over 2 months ago?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nNah, nothing like that, pal!\nPhoenix:\nThen, what is it like?\nGumshoe:\nShe ordered it. It was custom-made!\nPhoenix:\nCustom-made? The glove was custom-made?\nGumshoe:\nYup, that's what I said!\nJudge:\nHmm... So the glove was custom-made.\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nYour Honor, I really don't see how this glove is related to this case.\nJudge:\nYes, it would seem that there is little relevance. What do you think, Mr. Wright? Do you think this glove is really relevant to this case?\n\n\n\nOf course it's relevant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"I don't know where this will lead me, but...\"\n\n\n\n\nOf course it's not\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHmm, I suppose it isn't really relevant.\nJudge:\nTh-Then...  Then why were you wasting this court's time with irrelevant questions!?\nPhoenix:\nUh, I was curious and got, uh, carried away, Your Honor...?\nJudge:\nWitness, please ignore this airheaded lawyer and continue with your testimony.\nPayne:\nDetective Gumshoe, please tell the court why you knew about the baseball glove.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave him be\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Well, it's just a birthday present...)\nPayne:\nIf there are no further questions, Your Honor... \nJudge:\nHmm... Witness, why do you know about this glove?\nLeads back to cross-examinationGumshoe:\nI should know, 'cause she came to me to ask what she should get for him.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou discussed what the defendant was going to give to her boyfriend?\nGumshoe:\nWell, I'm, er... *ahem* She, uh... trusts me, so...\nPhoenix:\n(Boy does he look proud of himself right now...)Phoenix:\n...Byrde:\nWh-What is it this time?Phoenix:\nThat testimony didn't sound like it had any contradictions in it to me. There just wasn't anything that really stuck out as odd.Byrde:\nYeah... I wonder what would happen if you tried to get more information from him?Phoenix:\nGet more information?Byrde:\nYeah! You know! Like how they \"press\" people on those old cop shows, sir!Phoenix:\nSo I should try \"pressing\" him, huh?Phoenix:\n(I don't know where this will lead me, but...) Of course it is relevant! That glove is the key to this whole case!Byrde:\nYes! Bluffing to the max! Now, THIS is the Mr. Wright I know! I'm so happy you're back, sir! I was wondering how long it'd take! This is great!Phoenix:\n(Hmm, pressing people... It feels like I've done this before. As if I used to do this to squeeze information from even the most tight-lipped people.)Judge:\nVery well. If you are that convinced, then let's hear some more about this matter.Gumshoe:\nActually, I brought the glove with me today.Phoenix:\nAnd?Judge:\nWhy didn't you say so earlier? Hurry and show the glove to this court!Gumshoe:\nWell, I didn't think it had anything to do with this case... Anyway, this is it, sir.Judge:\nIt's, uh... rather yellow, isn't it?Baseball Glove added to the Court Record.Gumshoe:\nOfficer Prince really liked the color yellow.Phoenix:\nAnd that's why you had to special order it?Byrde:\nYup, that's right! That, and one other reason...Judge:\nI think this court has heard enough. It is clear that the victim and the defendant were involved with each other.Payne:\nYes, that's correct, Your Honor.Judge:\nNow, if that is true, it brings up an important question. Was the name \"Maggie\" really written by the victim?Payne:\nI see your point, Your Honor. Detective Gumshoe, please tell the court a little more about the name on the ground.Gumshoe:\nYes, sir.Witness Testimony-- Writing on the Ground --Gumshoe:\nWe first looked into the handwriting. (Changed from [We first looked into the handwriting, sir.] in the original release)\nUnfortunately, we couldn't confirm that it was the victim's handwriting.\nNext, we checked the victim's pointer finger.\nWe found out that there was sand trapped under the victim's fingernail.\nThere were also scratches on the skin that were caused by him writing on the ground.\nFrom this, we could confirm that the victim wrote this name with his right hand.Judge:\nHmm... Yes, a perfectly logical conclusion. Now then, Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Phoenix:\nThank you, Your Honor.Cross Examination-- Writing on the Ground --Gumshoe:\nWe first looked into the handwriting.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n \nPhoenix:\nBut can you really determine handwriting based on a sample written in sand? \nGumshoe:\nHeh, this is why amateurs are amateurs. We're not a buncha simpletons, pal! Scientific investigation in this country's actually pretty good. \nJudge:\nHmm, I believe it's time to get back to the real point. \nPayne:\nAgreed, Your Honor. So, what was the result of the investigation?Gumshoe:\nUnfortunately, we couldn't confirm that it was the victim's handwriting.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo in the end, you couldn't confirm it? \nGumshoe:\nHey, don't you look down on us! I told you! We're not a bunch of simpletons, pal! Everyone knows you can't find out everything you want with scientific investigation! \nJudge:\nI've never heard that before. \nPayne:\nMe, either. \nPhoenix:\nNor I. \nByrde:\nI never heard anything like that at the police academy, sir... \nGumshoe:\nOK, so I made it up. Anyway...Gumshoe:\nNext, we checked the victim's pointer finger.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHis pointer finger? \nGumshoe:\nYou know, the one you're always POINTING and waving around in people's faces. \nPhoenix:\nAha, ha, ha. Don't tell me it bothers you... \nGumshoe:\nEvery time you do it, I have a mini-heart attack. It's like you're trying to kill me, pal. \nPayne:\nIn any case, you examined the victim's index finger, correct? \nGumshoe:\nYeah. We figured there should be something on his finger if he had been writing in sand. \nJudge:\nHmm... And the results?Gumshoe:\nWe found that there was sand trapped under the victim's fingernail.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd what does that prove?\nGumshoe:\nWell, it proves that he did write that name with his own finger.\nPayne:\nYes, which explains why there was sand stuck under his nail.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess he's right...)\nGumshoe:\nAnd there's more...Gumshoe:\nThere were also scratches on the skin that were caused by him writing on the ground.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Scratches on his skin?\"\nGumshoe:\nYup. You can't see them with your naked eye, but they're there. \nJudge:\nThat is incredible! \nGumshoe:\nSure is! That's the power of scientific investigation! They're so small that we had to use a magnifying glass... like a really strong one. It's got that really scientific-sounding name... \nPhoenix:\nYou mean a microscope? \nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's it! We used one of those and that's how we found them! \nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe this guy doesn't know what a microscope is...)Gumshoe:\nFrom this, we could confirm that the victim wrote this name with his right hand.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely sure?\nGumshoe:\nI believe in the power of science.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, I wonder if my evidence is solid enough to counter with?)Present Baseball Glove\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Detective Gumshoe. Take a look at this.\"Phoenix:\n(Listening to this, you would think there was only one conclusion... that the name was definitely written by the victim...)Byrde:\nBut don't you think that would be really strange, sir!? If Dustin really wrote that message with his right hand, do you think I would have gone through that much trouble to get him his present?Phoenix:\n(The present...? What about it...?)Phoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe. Take a look at this.Gumshoe:\nThat's the glove, right?Phoenix:\nCould you tell the court what is special about this glove?Gumshoe:\nWhat's special? Um, never really thought about it, but uh... It's REALLY yellow... ... And that's about it.Phoenix:\nYes, it's REALLY yellow, but that is only one of its qualities.Gumshoe:\nHuh?Phoenix:\nThere's another reason why it's special.Judge:\nAnd what would that be?Phoenix:\nIt's very simple.Phoenix:\nThis glove is made for a left-handed person!Gumshoe:\nLeft-handed...?Judge:\nWhy, you're absolutely right! This glove is made to be worn on the right hand!Phoenix:\nThat is why it had to be custom-made. I have never seen a bright yellow left-hander's glove for sale. Have you?Gumshoe:\nWell, um... no.Phoenix:\nSo, Detective. Which hand did the victim use to write the name with, again...?Gumshoe:\nThat's easy! Look, it's obvious from this picture that it was his... W-W-Wait a sec...Phoenix:\nDon't forget that the victim was left-handed!Gumshoe:\nAaaaah!!Payne:Payne:\nThis is... This is... I mean... I... Objec--Judge:\nOverruled. Mr. Wright, I would like to know what your line of reasoning proves.Phoenix:\nThere is only one conclusion that can be drawn! A left-handed person could not have written a message with his right hand! Therefore! The person who wrote the name \"Maggie\" could not have been the victim!Judge:\nOrder! Order! When you think about it that way, then yes, it is not possible that this name was written by the victim himself.Gumshoe:\nThen that means Maggey is...!Payne:\nNo... IT'S NOT POSSIBLE!!Judge:\nMr. Payne.Payne:\nY-Y-Yes, Your Honor?Judge:\nThe evidence the prosecution has presented has failed to prove the defendant's guilt. In fact, I believe you have proven her to be innocent!Payne:\nNOOOOOOO!Byrde:\nAlright! You did it, Mr. Wright! Whew! I feel like I can breathe again!Judge:\nIt seems that we have reached the conclusion. You did a fine job once again, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nMe, Your Honor? Ah, well, thank you, sir...Byrde:\nSee, you got complimented by the judge again! You're really good! And that's why you can't give up being a lawyer, sir!Phoenix:\n(Are you joking!? I'm more than ready to retire!)Judge:\nI will now announce my verdict. This court finds the defendant, Maggey Byrde...Payne:Payne:\nNo!! Not yet! I mean, please give me a few more minutes, Your Honor.Judge:\nWh-What is the meaning of this, Mr. Payne!?Payne:\nThe prosecution is not finished yet!Phoenix:\nWhat do you mean!?Payne:\nWe would like to call our next witness to the stand!Phoenix:\nWhaaaaaaaaaat!?Judge:\nAnd what did this witness... witness?Payne:\nThe moment the victim was pushed to his death! What's more, he saw the very face of the culprit!Phoenix:\nWhat the heck!?Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! I believe a recess is in order. Afterward, we will hear from this new witness.Phoenix:\n(I had a feeling that was a bit too easy... Hmm, I need more information. I'll have to see what I can find out during this recess. I can't let my guard down! It's only going to get tougher from here!)Judge:\nCourt is adjourned for recess!To be continued.September 8, 11:43 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Byrde:\nA-Amnesia!? I can't believe my lawyer's trying to defend me in such a state...Phoenix:\n... I... Uh...Byrde:\nWhy didn't you tell me, sir!?Phoenix:\nI'm sorry I didn't mention it to you.Byrde:\nOh! I know what to do! I heard you can fix something like this with a really strong shock to your system! Come on, lower your head a little! A Maggey Kick should be all you need!Phoenix:\nAh, no, no, no. I think I'll pass on this one.Byrde:\nCome on! ... I-I'm sorry. (Changed from [Come on! ... Ah, I'm sorry.] in the original release) Whenever I see someone in trouble, I have a hard time leaving them alone... I tend to stick my nose where it doesn't belong and try to tackle everyone's problems.Phoenix:\n(Well, my head's one problem you won't be tackling today...) Well, we're here to solve your problem first. We can deal with mine later. For now, do you think you can fill me in on a few things?Byrde:\nOf course! I'd be honored to! Ah, well, I guess we'll start with my name and then I can tell you about me!Phoenix:\nNo, no, that's ok. Really. I think I know you and your name pretty well by now. I was wondering if you could help me figure out a few things about myself. So, my name is \"Phoenix Wright\"? What a weird name.Byrde:\nHmmmm... This is serious. You really don't remember. I'll tell you what, sir. You can have this back, and maybe it'll help!Phoenix:\n...? This is... a business card?Byrde:\nI got this from you. It's my most prized possession! You can borrow it for now, but please give it back, OK!?Phoenix:\nOK. (There are some numbers written on the back...)Byrde:\nOh, that's your cell phone number!Phoenix's Business Card added to the Court Record.Phoenix:\nI guess for now, we should stop talking about me, and start talking about this case.Byrde:\nThis case...?Phoenix:\nYup. Can you think of anything that would be helpful for me to know?Byrde:\nUm, what can I tell you...? Ah, um... Hmm... I can't think of anything other than the incident with that cell phone, but...Phoenix:\n...Cell phone?Byrde:\nYeah! Your eyes lit up when we talked about it at the Detention Center, sir!Phoenix:\n...!Phoenix:\nHurry up then and tell me! This might be very important!Byrde:\nOK! Roger! It was on the day of the crime, just before 6 PM... I picked up a lost cell phone while on a walk with Dustin.Phone:\n...............Byrde:\nAll of a sudden, the phone began to ring...Phone:\n...*beep*...Byrde:\n\"Um, hello?\"???:\n\"Oh, thank you! I've been searching for my phone.\"Byrde:\n\"Is this yours? Oh, I'm glad you called! We can meet up and I can give this back!\"???:\n\"I'll be right there, um... I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name...\"Byrde:\n\"You can call me Maggey!\"Byrde:\nWe agreed to meet up at 6 PM. Dustin and I waited for the person to show up... but they never did.Phoenix:\nHmmmm... So where is the phone you found now?Byrde:\nI gave it to you yesterday!Phoenix:\nHuh? To me? (Is it that phone in my pocket...?) Y-You mean this?Byrde:\nDo you think it has anything to do with the murder?Phoenix:\nI... don't really know... But if my eyes \"lit up\"...???:\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!! YOU WERE HERE ALL ALONG!! You're so mean!! I called you a million times but you wouldn't pick up! And when I went to check in the courtroom, everyone had already left...Phoenix:\n(Ack! Now who in the heck is this? Let me guess. I'm supposed to know this girl too...)???:\nHey, good morning, Maggey!Byrde:\nAnd a good morning to you, too, Maya!Maya:\nSo!? So!? How's it going!?Byrde:\nIs there a word for \"worse than abysmal\"...?Maya:\nOh? And what if I said that everything will be fine? That's right! It's Maya to the rescue with the ultra-decisive super-important evidence! Here you are, Nick! The thing you wanted me to bring!Phoenix:\nHuh? Oh, ah, thanks... (What the heck is this? A list? It has about 20 people's names and phone numbers written on it.)Maya:\nIt was kind of tough, but I managed to dig up some dirt! (Changed from [It was kind of tough, but I managed to find out some dirt!] in the original release) It looks like these guys are up to no good.Phoenix:\n\"No good\"? As in?Maya:\nThere's a group of con artists the police are currently investigating. I think these guys are members of that group.Names List added to the Court Record.Phoenix:\nWhy would a group of con artists pop up in a case like this?Maya:\nDon't look at me!Phoenix:\nHmm... And where did you get this list from in the first place?Maya:\nWhaaaaat!? Don't you remember, Nick!? (Changed from [Whaaaaat!? Why are you asking that!?] in the original release) You're the one who asked me to look this up yesterday!Phoenix:\nOh... is that right?Maya:\nThese numbers were in the memory of that phone Maggey found.Phoenix:\nHmm, so that's where they're from.Maya:\nYou're awfully forgetful these days, Nick. I hope I never get to be a forgetful old prune like you!Byrde:\nUm, Maya... Actually, Mr. Wright is...Bailiff:\nMr. Wright! Recess is now over. Please bring the defendant and return to the courtroom immediately!Maya:\nOh, oops! Guess you have to get going! We can talk about you being old later, Nick!Byrde:\nW-Wish us luck!Phoenix:\n(I guess I have all the pieces now... More or less. All that's left is to put it all together. I'm not going to lose this. I can't!)Maya:\nCome on, Nick. Better get a move on!Phoenix:\nY-Yeah.September 8, 11:54 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nThe court will now reconvene. Please call your next witness to the stand, Mr. Payne.Payne:\nYes, Your Honor. But before I do, if I may say a few words...Judge:\nWhat is it, Mr. Payne?Payne:\nIt's about the next witness. He has a tendency to say things that rub people the wrong way, you see, so I ask that the court might be a little lenient on...Judge:\nThere is no need to give a preface. Just hurry up and call your witness, please.Payne:\nY-Yes, Your Honor. ...The prosecution calls its next witness: a drifter who was taking a walk in the park on the day of the murder!Payne:\nPlease state your name for the court, witness.???:\nBefore I do, I'd like to clarify a little something.Payne:\nHuh? Oh, alright, go ahead.???:\nJust now, you introduced my wonderful self to the court, correct? Perhaps as a \"drifter who was taking a walk\"?Payne:\nD-Did I????:\nBut I will not stand for that! Now you've tinted the court's eyes and colored me wrongly. Sure, I suppose calling me a university student would not be the absolute truth, but to give in and just settle would be as evil as death and I can't have that! Everything in my life is to be of the utmost, highest, top grade quality, you understand. I am merely looking for that perfect, top notch, unbeatable university, don't you see...? I have a rigorous selection process and I was in serious thought during my \"walk\" as...Payne:\nYes, yes, I understand. I'm very sorry. I will be more careful from now on.Maya:\nWh-What is he? A human chatterbox?Phoenix:\nUgh... I have to question HIM????:\nFashion! Cars! Women! Glasses! And of course, University! First-rates only need apply!Phoenix:\n(Glasses...? But you aren't wearing glasses...)Judge:\nThat's enough! Your name, witness.???:\nOh? Is that how you want to play this? Using your power and influence to keep the young people down. I see how you work now. You old people and your dirty tricks. You thought you had me, but you thought wrong.Judge:\nI-I'm sorry. It won't happen again.Phoenix:\n(Oh man...)Wellington:\nI forgive you. Alright, I suppose I can tell you my name. I am Richard Wellington, the \"Drifting Virtuoso\" with a Ph.D. in Drifting, as it were. If you wanted to, you could call me a \"University Student in Transit\".Payne:\nAhem, Mr. Wellington. On the day of the murder, you were taking a... er, strolling through the park, correct?Wellington:\nIt would appear that you are attached to that word. If you must, then by all means. But I remind you that I am in no way a prepubescent boy, \"out on a walk\" with mommy. If you must know, I am--Payne:\nAnyway! Please testify to this court what you saw during your walk through the park!Wellington:\nSee, you said it again! \"Taking a walk\"... You know, you--Judge:\nWhat you witnessed will do, Mr. Wellington!Witness Testimony-- What I Saw That Day --Wellington:\nI was at the park all afternoon, deep in thought about my life situation.\nI don't remember the time all that well, but I do believe it was past 6 PM.\nAll of a sudden, a police officer falls from above, right in front of my eyes.\nWithout a thought, I looked up, and there I met the eyes of a charming, young lady.\nOf course I remember her sweet face. It was that of the pretty defendant there.\nThe only other thing I saw was the banana that fell with the police officer.Judge:\nHmm, that was certainly a decisive testimony.Maya:\nDecisive!? Nick, did you hear what he just said!?Phoenix:\nYeah.Maya:\nThat's all you have to say? How can you be so calm!?Phoenix:\n(It's strange... My mind is very calm and clear.) Maybe it's because I... believe in my client.Maya:\nYou mean Maggey?Phoenix:\nYes. And if she really is innocent, then that can only mean one thing: That guy is lying!Judge:\nYou may now question the witness, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\n(I'll find out the truth, no matter how well you craft your lies!)Cross Examination-- What I Saw That Day --Wellington:\nI was at the park all afternoon, deep in thought about my life situation.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you were at the park all afternoon? You seem to have a lot of free time. \nWellington:\nHmph. That was very rude of you. But then again, what can I expect? That's what you get from a man who graduated from a no-name, trashy university. \nPhoenix:\nN-No name? Trashy...? \nWellington:\nNow, this might be hard for a mush-headed, feeble-minded baboon like you, but I have to think very carefully about the future of our great country. \nPhoenix:\nBut I thought you said you were thinking about which college to go to just now... \nWellington:\nOh, puh-leaze. Which university I go to will directly affect the very future of this country! \nPhoenix:\n(That arrogant little snot...)Wellington:\nI don't remember the time all that well, but I do believe it was past 6 PM.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow did you know what time it was? I see you're not wearing a watch, so... \nWellington:\nIs that the best you can do? Do you think you can discredit me like that? You're just a third-rate, biased fool. I guess I can't expect real smarts from you. \nPhoenix:\n(Grr... His arrogance is really intolerable... So, what should I do now...?)\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAnswer the question! How did you know what time it was!?\nWellington:\nTsk, tsk. I can't believe I have to deal with a worm like you. You're just a shallow man who can only slam on desks and point at people for fun. Hmph, I guess I don't have a choice. I'll try to explain it so that even a third-rate simpleton like you can understand. There was this little thing they call a \"clock\" at the park. Did you get that? Do you know what a clock is? It's a thing that tells you the time.\nPayne:\nAs you can see, Mr. Wright, it's even in this picture of the crime scene.\nPhoenix:\n(Oh... So it is... Urk.)\nWellington:\nI looked at that clock, and that's how I knew the time. But if you ask me, this whole concept of breaking time apart into fragments... It's total and utter nonsense that no man should follow. A real first-class person doesn't live by, nor is he chained by, time. And to wear a watch? Hah! What a ridiculous notion! People should live freely without constraints. That's how life should be!\nPhoenix:\n(And yet again, another flood of meaningless words... Talk about a first-class waste of time...)\nWellington:\nIn any case...\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nLeave him be\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I guess there's no point in pressing him further. After all, there was a clock right there at the crime scene...)\nLeads back to cross-examinationWellington:\nAll of a sudden, a police officer falls from above, right in front of my eyes.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd how did you know he was a police officer?\nWellington:\nYou obviously have no idea how powerful my deductive reasoning skills are. With one glance, I could tell just what kind of occupation he held. That shoddy, do-it-yourself hairstyle practically screamed \"I'm a police officer\". It was also the way he tied his tie and those cheap, low-quality shoes. Ugh. Oh, and I suppose it was also because he was wearing an officer's uniform.\nPhoenix:\n(Shouldn't that statement have come first!?)\nMaya:\nWow, that's pretty impressive. Hey, Nick! Do you think he's figured out what I do?\nPhoenix:\n(Even I haven't figured that out yet...)Wellington:\nWithout a thought, I looked up, and there I met the eyes of a charming, young lady.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure you got a good look at her face?\nWellington:\nAnimals have this thing called an \"eye\", Mr. Wright. They use this \"eye\" to see things. In the case of humans, we have two of them. Yes, even you!\nPhoenix:\nI don't care if I have them or not! Did you or did you not get a clear look at her face!?\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nThat's what the witness was just about to get to. I would like to request that Mr. Wright not use such a loud voice during questioning.\nJudge:\nSustained. Mr. Wright, please refrain from raising your voice in this court.\nPhoenix:\n(Then please don't make me have to raise my voice.)\nWellington:\nAre you finished? I'd like to continue, if that's alright with you.Wellington:\nOf course I remember her sweet face. It was that of the pretty defendant there.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you're SURE you are not mistaken?\nWellington:\nPlease. Don't confuse your pitiful, train-wreck of a life with mine. I'm what you call a famous brand-name product, while you are only a cheap imitation. There is no way someone as magnificent as myself could have made a mistake.\nPayne:\nOf course, of course.\nPhoenix:\n(Oh ho ho ho. Of course.)\nJudge:\nDid you notice anything else of interest, witness?Wellington:\nThe only other thing I saw was the banana that fell with the police officer.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe banana...?\nWellington:\nWell, it was actually more than just one. More like a bunch of bananas.\nPhoenix:\nNow what would a bunch of bananas be doing there...?\nWellington:\nAnd why would I know such a thing? I'm only telling you what I saw.\nMaya:\nThat's really strange. Maggey never mentioned anything about a bunch of bananas. That's it, Nick! He's gotta be lying about the bananas!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... He could be, but... there's no reason for him to lie about there being bananas at the crime scene.) And what if it's not a lie?\nMaya:\nWell, maybe he thought he was seeing one thing, and it was something else...?\nPhoenix:\n(If he mistook something else for a bunch of bananas, then that would be an inaccuracy. Think Phoenix, think!)Present Baseball Glove\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Wellington.\"Phoenix:\n(If my client is innocent, there is no way he could've seen what he says he did.)Maya:\nWhich means if we can somehow show he's lying...Phoenix:\nYeah, that's exactly what we need do. (She's right. She's got a sharp mind, but I just wish I could remember who she is...)Maya:\nIs everything OK, Nick...?Phoenix:\nMr. Wellington. I believe I have the bananas you saw... right here!Wellington:\nAh, so you knew about the bananas, too. Why didn't you say so earlier? But don't think you can use this as a way to pull more information out of me.Phoenix:\n(And that's where you'd be wrong.)Judge:\nM-Mr. Wright. What is the meaning of this?Payne:\nIsn't that the baseball glove?Wellington:\nHuh!? Wh-Wh-What!? A baseball glove??Phoenix:\nDoesn't it look delicious? Care for a bite?Wellington:\nTh-That's... That's not... It's a... Noooooooo!Phoenix:\nYour Honor! I think this proves one very important fact! This witness...loves bananas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. Wellington loves large bananas!\nJudge:\n...\nPayne:\n...\nWellington:\n... \n............\nMaya:\nUh, Nick... I hope you've noticed the icy glares we're getting from everyone in here!\nJudge:\nWh-What in the world do you mean?\nWellington:\nI'll have you know I like strawberries much better than bananas.\nPhoenix:\nWhoops...\nJudge:\nThink it over one more time and try again, Mr. Wright. \nLeads back to:\n\"This witness...\"had bad eyesight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"By the way, just how bad are your eyes?\"knows nothing about baseball\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. Wellington has never played baseball! That would explain why he didn't even know what a glove is!\nJudge:\n...\nPayne:\n...\nWellington:\n...\n............\nMaya:\nUh, Nick... I hope you've noticed the icy glares we're getting from everyone in here!\nJudge:\nWh-What in the world do you mean?\nWellington:\nWhen I was in junior high, I was a star pitcher... Well, 4th in line, actually, but...\nPhoenix:\nWhoops...\nJudge:\nThink it over one more time and try again, Mr. Wright. \nLeads back to:\n\"This witness...\"Phoenix:\nBy the way, just how bad are your eyes?Wellington:\nHuh? How... What... You... Why are you asking me about this all of a sudden!?Payne:Payne:\nYour Honor, it is very simple to mistake a glove for a bunch of bananas...Judge:\nNo, I don't think so. Objection overruled.Wellington:\nY-Y-You... You're one of those people. Yes, you know what I mean. You're like those people who refused to accept Galileo for his Copernican Theory! You're too used to your world view to realize that there are other, new possibilities! Sure, in the end, we find out that it is in fact, a glove, not bananas. However... when viewed from afar, I do think there is room enough for doubt, don't you...?Phoenix:\nAnd that is why I asked you how bad your eyesight is!Wellington:\nThey're both 20/200. I suppose you're going to tell me that's terrible, right!?Judge:\nWhy are you not wearing your glasses today then?Wellington:\n... Ummm... That's because I lost them recently, you see... Of course, I was planning on getting a new pair made right away! But you know, my glasses are no ordinary glasses, so to replace them--Phoenix:\nHow about when you witnessed the crime? Were you wearing your glasses then?Wellington:\n...!Phoenix:\nHow about it, witness!?Wellington:\nY-You are an unrelenting, evil man. You're like those people who rejected Joan of Arc and put her to death! She was brave and courageous, only to be caught by horrible, unrighteous people. And while she didn't do anything wrong, she was still gruesomely burned at the--Phoenix:\nWhich boils down to you were not wearing your glasses at that time! Therefore!

It was very possible for him to see the face of the culprit standing on the upper path!Judge:\nHmm... Witness. Please be more accurate in your testimony. Remember, a person's life is at stake.Wellington:\nY-Yes, Your Honor!Judge:\nNow then, please continue with your testimony.Payne:\nPlease tell the court what happened next, in the moments after you witnessed the crime.Witness Testimony-- What Happened Next --Wellington:\nThe girl on the upper path ran away as soon as she realized I was there.\nAfter that, I immediately called the police station to report the crime.\nIt must've been 6:45 PM when I made the call.\nThey must have a lot of free time on their hands since they showed up within 10 minutes.Judge:\nHmm... So the person who was on the upper path saw you and then ran away.Wellington:\nYes, that is correct. Which is why, even someone without a superior brain like mine can understand that... that girl is the murderer!Judge:\nYou may question the witness now, Mr. Wright.Cross Examination",
    "newContext": "-- What I Saw That Day --Wellington:\nI was at the park all afternoon, deep in thought about my life situation.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you were at the park all afternoon? You seem to have a lot of free time. \nWellington:\nHmph. That was very rude of you. But then again, what can I expect? That's what you get from a man who graduated from a no-name, trashy university. \nPhoenix:\nN-No name? Trashy...? \nWellington:\nNow, this might be hard for a mush-headed, feeble-minded baboon like you, but I have to think very carefully about the future of our great country. \nPhoenix:\nBut I thought you said you were thinking about which college to go to just now... \nWellington:\nOh, puh-leaze. Which university I go to will directly affect the very future of this country! \nPhoenix:\n(That arrogant little snot...)Wellington:\nI don't remember the time all that well, but I do believe it was past 6 PM.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow did you know what time it was? I see you're not wearing a watch, so... \nWellington:\nIs that the best you can do? Do you think you can discredit me like that? You're just a third-rate, biased fool. I guess I can't expect real smarts from you. \nPhoenix:\n(Grr... His arrogance is really intolerable... So, what should I do now...?)\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAnswer the question! How did you know what time it was!?\nWellington:\nTsk, tsk. I can't believe I have to deal with a worm like you. You're just a shallow man who can only slam on desks and point at people for fun. Hmph, I guess I don't have a choice. I'll try to explain it so that even a third-rate simpleton like you can understand. There was this little thing they call a \"clock\" at the park. Did you get that? Do you know what a clock is? It's a thing that tells you the time.\nPayne:\nAs you can see, Mr. Wright, it's even in this picture of the crime scene.\nPhoenix:\n(Oh... So it is... Urk.)\nWellington:\nI looked at that clock, and that's how I knew the time. But if you ask me, this whole concept of breaking time apart into fragments... It's total and utter nonsense that no man should follow. A real first-class person doesn't live by, nor is he chained by, time. And to wear a watch? Hah! What a ridiculous notion! People should live freely without constraints. That's how life should be!\nPhoenix:\n(And yet again, another flood of meaningless words... Talk about a first-class waste of time...)\nWellington:\nIn any case...\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nLeave him be\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I guess there's no point in pressing him further. After all, there was a clock right there at the crime scene...)\nLeads back to cross-examinationWellington:\nAll of a sudden, a police officer falls from above, right in front of my eyes.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd how did you know he was a police officer?\nWellington:\nYou obviously have no idea how powerful my deductive reasoning skills are. With one glance, I could tell just what kind of occupation he held. That shoddy, do-it-yourself hairstyle practically screamed \"I'm a police officer\". It was also the way he tied his tie and those cheap, low-quality shoes. Ugh. Oh, and I suppose it was also because he was wearing an officer's uniform.\nPhoenix:\n(Shouldn't that statement have come first!?)\nMaya:\nWow, that's pretty impressive. Hey, Nick! Do you think he's figured out what I do?\nPhoenix:\n(Even I haven't figured that out yet...)Wellington:\nWithout a thought, I looked up, and there I met the eyes of a charming, young lady.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure you got a good look at her face?\nWellington:\nAnimals have this thing called an \"eye\", Mr. Wright. They use this \"eye\" to see things. In the case of humans, we have two of them. Yes, even you!\nPhoenix:\nI don't care if I have them or not! Did you or did you not get a clear look at her face!?\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nThat's what the witness was just about to get to. I would like to request that Mr. Wright not use such a loud voice during questioning.\nJudge:\nSustained. Mr. Wright, please refrain from raising your voice in this court.\nPhoenix:\n(Then please don't make me have to raise my voice.)\nWellington:\nAre you finished? I'd like to continue, if that's alright with you.Wellington:\nOf course I remember her sweet face. It was that of the pretty defendant there.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you're SURE you are not mistaken?\nWellington:\nPlease. Don't confuse your pitiful, train-wreck of a life with mine. I'm what you call a famous brand-name product, while you are only a cheap imitation. There is no way someone as magnificent as myself could have made a mistake.\nPayne:\nOf course, of course.\nPhoenix:\n(Oh ho ho ho. Of course.)\nJudge:\nDid you notice anything else of interest, witness?Wellington:\nThe only other thing I saw was the banana that fell with the police officer.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe banana...?\nWellington:\nWell, it was actually more than just one. More like a bunch of bananas.\nPhoenix:\nNow what would a bunch of bananas be doing there...?\nWellington:\nAnd why would I know such a thing? I'm only telling you what I saw.\nMaya:\nThat's really strange. Maggey never mentioned anything about a bunch of bananas. That's it, Nick! He's gotta be lying about the bananas!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... He could be, but... there's no reason for him to lie about there being bananas at the crime scene.) And what if it's not a lie?\nMaya:\nWell, maybe he thought he was seeing one thing, and it was something else...?\nPhoenix:\n(If he mistook something else for a bunch of bananas, then that would be an inaccuracy. Think Phoenix, think!)Present Baseball Glove\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Wellington.\"Phoenix:\n(If my client is innocent, there is no way he could've seen what he says he did.)Maya:\nWhich means if we can somehow show he's lying...Phoenix:\nYeah, that's exactly what we need do. (She's right. She's got a sharp mind, but I just wish I could remember who she is...)Maya:\nIs everything OK, Nick...?Phoenix:\nMr. Wellington. I believe I have the bananas you saw... right here!Wellington:\nAh, so you knew about the bananas, too. Why didn't you say so earlier? But don't think you can use this as a way to pull more information out of me.Phoenix:\n(And that's where you'd be wrong.)Judge:\nM-Mr. Wright. What is the meaning of this?Payne:\nIsn't that the baseball glove?Wellington:\nHuh!? Wh-Wh-What!? A baseball glove??Phoenix:\nDoesn't it look delicious? Care for a bite?Wellington:\nTh-That's... That's not... It's a... Noooooooo!Phoenix:\nYour Honor! I think this proves one very important fact! This witness...loves bananas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. Wellington loves large bananas!\nJudge:\n...\nPayne:\n...\nWellington:\n... \n............\nMaya:\nUh, Nick... I hope you've noticed the icy glares we're getting from everyone in here!\nJudge:\nWh-What in the world do you mean?\nWellington:\nI'll have you know I like strawberries much better than bananas.\nPhoenix:\nWhoops...\nJudge:\nThink it over one more time and try again, Mr. Wright. \nLeads back to:\n\"This witness...\"had bad eyesight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"By the way, just how bad are your eyes?\"knows nothing about baseball\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. Wellington has never played baseball! That would explain why he didn't even know what a glove is!\nJudge:\n...\nPayne:\n...\nWellington:\n...\n............\nMaya:\nUh, Nick... I hope you've noticed the icy glares we're getting from everyone in here!\nJudge:\nWh-What in the world do you mean?\nWellington:\nWhen I was in junior high, I was a star pitcher... Well, 4th in line, actually, but...\nPhoenix:\nWhoops...\nJudge:\nThink it over one more time and try again, Mr. Wright. \nLeads back to:\n\"This witness...\"Phoenix:\nBy the way, just how bad are your eyes?Wellington:\nHuh? How... What... You... Why are you asking me about this all of a sudden!?Payne:Payne:\nYour Honor, it is very simple to mistake a glove for a bunch of bananas...Judge:\nNo, I don't think so. Objection overruled.Wellington:\nY-Y-You... You're one of those people. Yes, you know what I mean. You're like those people who refused to accept Galileo for his Copernican Theory! You're too used to your world view to realize that there are other, new possibilities! Sure, in the end, we find out that it is in fact, a glove, not bananas. However... when viewed from afar, I do think there is room enough for doubt, don't you...?Phoenix:\nAnd that is why I asked you how bad your eyesight is!Wellington:\nThey're both 20/200. I suppose you're going to tell me that's terrible, right!?Judge:\nWhy are you not wearing your glasses today then?Wellington:\n... Ummm... That's because I lost them recently, you see... Of course, I was planning on getting a new pair made right away! But you know, my glasses are no ordinary glasses, so to replace them--Phoenix:\nHow about when you witnessed the crime? Were you wearing your glasses then?Wellington:\n...!Phoenix:\nHow about it, witness!?Wellington:\nY-You are an unrelenting, evil man. You're like those people who rejected Joan of Arc and put her to death! She was brave and courageous, only to be caught by horrible, unrighteous people. And while she didn't do anything wrong, she was still gruesomely burned at the--Phoenix:\nWhich boils down to you were not wearing your glasses at that time! Therefore!

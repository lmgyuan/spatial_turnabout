What is it, Pearls?\nPearl:\nDoes magic have anything to do with channeling spirits?\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think it has anything to do with channeling...) You don't know about magic, do you Pearls?\nPearl:\nI'm sorry...\nPhoenix:\n(I braved the winter cold and took Pearls to see the circus. It's been six months since the incident in Kurain Village... and it was during that trying time that I met Pearls... (Changed from [It was during that terrible time that I met Pearls...] in the original release) Thankfully, she seems to be recovering from it, and is returning to her normal self. (Changed from [It seems like she is starting to get back to normal...] in the original release))\nMaya:\nAhh... It's time to go.\nPearl:\nYou're right. We can't miss the last train.\nPhoenix:\nPearls! You remembered the train!\nPearl:\nOf course I did! But I don't really understand what everyone means by \"express train\".\nMaya:\nWell, Nick...

You have to turn on the TV!\nPhoenix:\n(The TV?)\nTV:\n...Now let's check in at the scene!\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? What happened...?)\nTV:\n...Thank you. We're here at the Berry Big Circus.

They arrested him too!\nPhoenix:\nA-Arrested who?\nMaya:\nMax! They arrested Max Galactica!!\nPhoenix:\n(Maximillion Galactica. Fans call him Max. A popular magician who can fly through the sky at will... Maya said she was a huge fan of Max...)\nMaya:\nAlright Nick! I'll see you in two hours at the Detention Center.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?

You've still got plenty of time to clean up your office later!\nPhoenix:\nW-WWWHHHAATTT!?\nPhone:\n...*beep*...\nDecember 28, 11:19 AMDetention CenterVisitor's Room\nMaya:\nWhat are they talking about? Why did they arrest Max?\nPhoenix:\nYou're asking the wrong man on that one, Maya. Maybe he used his magical skills to deal death with a slight [sic] of hand...\nMaya:\nMaximillion Galactica would never do such a thing!!\n???:\nFABULOUS!! What the young lady just said was absolutely fabulous! What a clever girl! Such a fabulous understanding of events!\nPhoenix:\n(...What's with all this fabulous talk...)\nMax:\nWelcome to the Visitor's Room!\nMaya:\nIt's MAX!! Nick!! Look!

I want this one.\nMax:\nSo sweetie, let's be honest here... You came to this visitor's room to visit me, didn't you?\nMaya:\nY-Yes! I'm your biggest fan!!\nMax:\nFabulous! Absolutely fabulous! Thank you so much!!\nPhoenix:\nHey... Umm... What about my card?\nMax:\nThink of it as a souvenir.\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nWell Nick... I think it's time to get to work.\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nWhat's the matter, Nick? Why are you looking at the ceiling?\nPhoenix:\nI was just thinking about what I should have for lunch.\nMax:\nSweetie... Drop porcupine head over there. Shower me with your attention. OK?\nMaya:\nO-O-O-Oh, yes...! (Changed from [Y-Y-Y-Yes...] in the original release)\nMax:\nAb-so-lute-ly... FABULOUS!!\nPhoenix:\n(Absolutely cringe inducing.)\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Attorney's Badge:\nMax:\n... Anyways... I've been curious about something for a while now.\nMaya:\nWhat's that?\nMax:\nWhy do you keep looking at me with such a sad look on your face, sweetie?\nMaya:\nBe-Because! You've been arrested! For murder!\nMax:\nOh, don't be ignorant. They wouldn't arrest someone like me!!\nPhoenix:\nWhy is that?\nMax:\nObviously because I'm the fabulous Maximillion Galactica!\nPhoenix:\nSo?\nMax:\nI'm the very big star of the Berry Big Circus.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that means?\nMax:\nI'm rich. I'm paid fabulous sums!\nPhoenix:\nWhich means what?\nMax:\n...\nMaya:\nMax...\nMax:\nQuit joking around! You've got to be pulling my magic wand! The police aren't really serious about all this, are they?\nPhoenix:\nThey don't arrest people as a joke.\nMax:\n...!!\nMaya:\nLook at Max... He's crushed...\nPhoenix:\nWell he needed to wake up and smell the coffee. (This is serious business.)\nMax:\nUmm... Umm...\nPhoenix:\nYes?\nMax:\nPorcu... I mean, Sir. You're a lawyer, right?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Oh, yeah. I'm an attorney.\nMax:\nPlease! Help me! I didn't kill nobody!\nMaya:\n\"Didn't kill nobody!?\"\nMax:\nI may be more spoiled than a hog in a hamburger mud pit... But a killer!? That's insane... I... I... I could never...\nMaya:\nM-Max?\nMax:\nI swear!! I just wanted to pay off my daddy's debt... He's back on the farm...\nPhoenix:\nOK... OK... I'll take your case.\nMax:\nR-Really?\nPhoenix:\nReally.\nMax:\nUh... Thank ya much. Ya'll sure are nice folks.\nMaya:\nUmm... Max.\nMax:\nYes?\nMaya:\nWhat's your real name?\nMax:\nIt's Billy Bob Johns...\nMaya:\n............ (Changed from [... Ugh...] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nWhat's the matter, Maya?\nMaya:\nHe's really just a country bumpkin!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMax:\n...Ahem. I must apologize for not being my absolutely fabulous self just now, sweetie.\nMaya:\nH-Huh?\nMax:\nMr. Attorney.\nPhoenix:\nYes?\nMax:\nA few minutes ago, you took one of my cards, didn't you?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Now that he mentions it... I did take a card.)\nMax:\nIt was the 10 of Hearts. Right?\nPhoenix:\n(Wha... How'd he... He got it right, again!)\nMax:\nWhat can I say? You, too... You've stolen some of my most valued possessions. Ten of Maximillion Galactica's hearts...\nPhoenix:\n(You sure do have a lot of hearts, don't you?)\nMax:\nAh ha ha ha... I'm putting my faith in you sweetie.\nPhoenix:\n(He didn't just call me sweetie, did he?)\nMaya:\nAlright! Let's make this an absolutely fabulous case! C'mon, Nick!\nDecember 28Wright & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nAlright... We've got lots of things we have to look into. No time for slacking. Let's get going.\nMaya:\nOK.\nPhoenix:\n? What's the matter? You seem down.\nMaya:\nMaximilion Galactica... Who would have guessed he was country bumpkin?\nDecember 28Berry Big CircusCircus Entrance\nMaya:\nWe're here again...\nPhoenix:\nYep. But this time we are here for work. (It hasn't been that long since the crime, so the police are still on the scene.)\nMaya:\nLet's find someone who might know something about what happened.\nPhoenix:\nSounds like a plan.\nDecember 28Lodging HousePlaza\nPhoenix:\nThis seems to be a dorm where all the performers in the circus stay...\nMaya:\nReally!? So we might run into that stoogey clown here, right? He's so kooky! (Changed from [Really!? So that stoogey clown should be here, huh? He's so kooky!] in the original release)\n???:\nAhhh! It's you two!\nMaya:\nOh... Detective Gumshoe!\nGumshoe:\nHow is it you guys always seem to know when I'm working a crime scene, pal? (Changed from [I always see you hanging around when I'm working a crime scene, pal.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nBecause you're always working, Detective. (Changed from [You always seem to be working so hard, Detective.] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nWell, I'd rather not be always working, but with crime, you don't make your own hours. (Changed from [I'd rather not be working hard, but with crime you don't make your own hours.] in the original release) If I have to be at the circus anyway, I want to see the lion tamer and the tightrope. However, no matter where I go, the show is always the same... Dead body. Stage left.\nMaya:\nNick! Nick! He complained!!\nPhoenix:\nHeh heh... That's a rarity. Let's get back to business now, OK?\nAfter clearing \"The eyewitness\" Talk option in Lodging House - Plaza:\nDecember 28Lodging Hall 1st FloorMoe's Room\nPhoenix:\nI wonder whose room this is. (Changed from [This is it?] in the original release)\nMaya:\nThe nametag on the door says \"Moe\" on it.\nPhoenix:\nI guess he's not here...\nMaya:\nWow... It's a real mess in here!\nPhoenix:\n(My room's probably worse though...)\nMaya:\nOh well... I give up. We'll have to come back later.\nDecember 28Berry Big CircusBig Top\nPhoenix:\nThe circus stage sure doesn't look this small from out in the audience...\nMaya:\nWow... This is where they all perform, isn't it? Nick! Do some somersaults!\nPhoenix:\nI'm not doing any somersaults.\nMaya:\nWhy not!? You look like you'd be great at it!\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I look like I'd be great at somersaults!?)\n???:\nGrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...\nMaya:\nHuh? Nick?\nPhoenix:\nIt wasn't me.\n???:\nGrrrrrrrrrrr... Grawwwwwww!!\nMaya:\nT-T-T-T-T-T-T... TIGER!!\nPhoenix:\nH-H-H-He's c-c-coming this way!!\n???:\nGrrrrrrrrr... Grawwwwwww!!\nPhoenix:\nAHHHHHHHHHHH!!\nMaya:\nNick! You're too young to die! NICK!!\n???:\nSTAY! STAY! HEEL!\n???:\nGrrrrrrrrr...\nPhoenix:\n(I'm still here... I'm not dead, yet!!)\nMaya:\nN-Nick! Nick! Are you OK?\n???:\nAhahaha! Scared ya didn't I? Regent is such a cute tiger! Isn't he!?\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\n...\n???:\nWhat's the matter? You two sure are quiet.\nMaya:\nDon't \"What's the matter?\" me! N-Nick... He almost died there!!\n???:\nHah! He wasn't anywhere close to getting hurt, let alone dying! This little tiger hardly ever bites people. And besides, people normally never get to play with a wild tiger, right? So if you think about it, you're actually really lucky!\nPhoenix:\nHuh!?\n???:\nYou agree, don't you?\nPhoenix:\n... I guess...\nMaya:\nW-W-W-What do you mean you guess!? Why are you agreeing with her?\n???:\nWoohoo!! Your costume...\nMaya:\nEh?\n???:\nIt's cute. I wanna try it on!!\nMaya:\nC-Costume? You mean my clothes...?\n???:\nYou don't mind letting me try it on, right?\nMaya:\nUhh... I guess not...\n???:\nREALLY!? Hehehehehe!! You're the best!\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... The tables turned quickly on that one. So much for the tiger thing...)\n???:\nOh! I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Regina Berry... The renowned animal tamer of the Berry Big Circus!\nMaya:\nMy name's Maya Fey. I'm a spirit medium.\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix Wright. Attorney at law. (When you put us up next to an animal tamer, I bet we really look odd!)\nRegina:\nNice to meet ya!\nPhoenix:\nUhh... Likewise...\nDetention Center\nAfter clearing \"Something unusual\" and \"The eyewitness\" Talk options in Lodging House - Plaza, and visiting Big Top:\nDecember 28Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nMaya:\n... Max isn't here.\nPhoenix:\nHe must be in questioning.\nMaya:\nAww... I wanted to see a magic trick.\nPhoenix:\nHe should be back in a little bit.\nMaya:\nI guess so.\nLodging House - Plaza\nWright & Co. Law Offices\nAfter presenting Russell Berry profile in Berry Big Circus - Big Top:\nDecember 28Big TopRingmaster's Room\nMaya:\nThis was the Ringmaster's room?\nPhoenix:\nYes. This room belonged to the victim. Which means this must be where Max met the Ringmaster last night.\nMaya:\nNow that you mention it, that is what he said.\nPhoenix:\nI wonder what... Hmm... That's an interesting poster. (Changed from [I wonder what... Hmm... That's an intresting [sic] poster.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nAh! It's a poster of Max! I want it! I want it! Nick!

Ha... Huh? M-Me?\nPhoenix:\nYes. You work at the circus don't you?\n???:\nN-No. I'm just your everyday average Joe.\nMaya:\nAn average Joe who just happens to hang out at the circus? I don't think so.\n???:\nY-Yes I am. I've got nothing to do with what's going on here.\nPhoenix:\n(He's lying. Like any regular person would hang around the circus... Dressed like that!) I'm an attorney. My name is Phoenix Wright.\nMaya:\nI'm a spirit medium. My name is Maya.\n???:\nWell... I... Um... Just happened to be... Umm... Passing by...\nPhoenix:\nI don't suppose you happen to be some kind of carny?\n???:\nNot a c-c-carny... I-I'm a p-performer. Actually, I'm a v-v-v-ventriloquist.\nMaya:\nVentriloquist?\n???:\nHe-he-he-he-he-he-he... I-I-I'm Benjamin Wo-Wo-Wo-Woodman...\nMaya:\nYour last name is Woodman? *snicker* (Changed from [You're [sic] last name is Woodman? *snicker*] in the original release)\n???:\nY-Yes... T-T-That's right... But e-everyone c-c-calls me B-B-B-B-B-Ben.\nMaya:\nAh... Yes yes yes... That's your alias, right?\nPhoenix:\nI believe they call it a stage name.\nBig Top\nWright & Co.

Aha!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMoe:\nI welched on giving you more than one!!\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nMoe:\nNo no no! If it was funny, it is your duty as a human being to laugh!! People who don't laugh are usually last-seen in Lan-sing. Catch my drift? Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Maya?\nMaya:\nAha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nPhoenix:\n(This is like some Faustian nightmare...)\nMaya:\nC'mon! It was funny! Clowns are always funny in my book!\nPhoenix:\nIn my book, they're just funny lookin'.\nMoe:\nYou sure do have a great taste in clothes girlie! Look at that garb! You look just like Gretta Garb... OH! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nPhoenix:\n*sigh* I'm goin' home...\nMaya:\nNo! Nick! You can't!!\nPhoenix:\nYou know, I can excuse a bad joke or two... But this stooge keeps laughing at his own jokes! That's what I object to!\nMaya:\nOK OK... I get it. But you have to admit he is kinda funny...\nPhoenix:\n(Argghhh... No, I do not have to admit that, because he isn't!)\nMoe:\nAha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nWright & Co. Law Offices\nBig Top\nAfter presenting Max profile in Lodging Hall 1st Floor - Moe's Room:\nDecember 28Big TopCafeteria\nMaya:\nEww... This place is gross.\nPhoenix:\nThis must be because of last night. They didn't have time to clean up after dinner because of the murder.\nMaya:\nThat reminds me... What was it that Moe said?\nPhoenix:\nHe said that yesterday morning Max \"clonked\" Ben over the head here.\nMaya:\nHe also said that, \"There's Gotti be something interesting there.\" Nick? What's \"Gotti be interesting?\"\nPhoenix:\nDon't ask...\nMaya:\nHmph!\nAfter examining posters and table in Big Top - Ringmaster's Room and clearing all Talk options in Lodging Hall 1st Floor - Moe's Room:\nDecember 28Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nMax:\nOh!

Ben's not here anymore!\nPhoenix:\nYeah... I wanted to ask him something.\nMaya:\nIt's cold out... He's probably in the tent.\nDecember 28Berry Big CircusBig Top\nMaya:\nWhat do you think, Nick? I wonder if we've been making any progress...\nPhoenix:\nDon't be so negative... Of course we are making progress.\nMaya:\nBut... Everyone loved the Ringmaster... And there's no sign of footprints on the scene... There's still a lot of mysteries left to be solved.\nPhoenix:\nOf course.\nMaya:\nAnd now Regina isn't here!\nPhoenix:\nI'm not seeing how that's related...\nDecember 28Big TopRingmaster's Room\nMaya:\nIt looks the same as always... A great big mess. Considering how messy it is, I bet they wouldn't notice if another poster went missing.\nPhoenix:\nWill you just stop it, you poster pilferer!\nMaya:\nI'm just kidding! You know I already got one of these posters!!\nPhoenix:\nYou mean \"stole\" one of those posters!\nMaya:\nYeah... Uh... Let's focus on what Max told us.

Now try speaking to me again, but this time with some proper respect!\nPhoenix:\n(Not again... *sigh*) Mr. Quist... Is that better?\nTrilo:\nNo! Look at me when I am talking to you, you 8-bit excuse for an attorney!\nBen:\nTrilo! We talked about insulting people! You promised!!\nTrilo:\nBut he was mocking me!

Being mean to bullies was not included in the deal!] in the original release)\nBen:\nI'm sorry, Trilo...\nMaya:\nNick! What just happened? Trilo is still a puppet right? A ventriloquist's puppet!\nTrilo:\nHey! Who do you think you are, calling me a puppet!?\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nBen:\nUmm... Uhh... Thanks...

Money?\nAfter presenting Trilo Quist, then clearing all Talk options in Big Top - Cafeteria:\nDecember 28Lodging HousePlaza\nMaya:\nHuh? Detective Gumshoe took off already.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... Probably because we ditched him earlier. (Changed from [Yep. Just leave him alone for a while, OK Maya?] in the original release) I bet he and the other cops got lonely and headed back to the precinct. (Changed from [I'm sure he just got lonely and headed back to the precinct.] in the original release)\nDecember 28Lodging Hall 1st FloorMoe's Room\nMoe:\nOh my! If it isn't \"Mr. Wright All The Time\"!!\nPhoenix:\n*ugh*\nMoe:\nIt's all Wright to be wrong every now and again, Wright?\nMaya:\nSee Nick! It just took awhile for the joke to find its audience!\nPhoenix:\n... *sigh*\nMoe:\nSo what can I do for you? Did you remember a good joke you wanted to tell me? Pull up a chair, or maybe just pull my finger, and let me have it.\nMaya:\nWe're going to get the same sound effect either way, aren't we?\nMoe:\nHow'd you know I put a whopee [sic] cushion on the chair!? You really know what it takes to be a clown, don't you? Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!

It seems like he's not around today...\nMaya:\nEh... That's a big pile of junk over in the corner...\nMoe:\nI don't think it'd be wrong to assume that Phoenix's stuff is over there too... Just be careful to make sure you've got the Wright stuff.\nMaya:\nThanks Moe! See you later!\nMoney has been added to the Court Record.\nAcro's Room\nMaya:\nHoly cow! There's a fork...

Check this out.\nMaya:\nIt's a ring...\nPhoenix:\nThere's something engraved on it... \"From T to R\"...\nRing put in pocket.\nPhoenix:\nWell... I think it's about time we wrap up our investigation...\nMaya:\nDo you think we'll win in court tomorrow?\nPhoenix:\nWho knows... Even I can't imagine what kind of testimony will come out tomorrow. (I'm guessing Moe will be a witness in court tomorrow... Moe and maybe the puppet.)\nMaya:\nDon't worry Nick. No matter what, we've still got a magician on our side!!\nPhoenix:\nThat's good, because we might need some magic tomorrow...\nTo be continued.\nMoe's Room (before examining junk pile in Lodging Hall 3rd Floor - Acro's Room)\nMaya:\nHuh? Moe must have gone off somewhere...\nPhoenix:\nJust as long as he isn't off writing new jokes...\nMaya:\nOh, that reminds me Nick... You have to get your Attorney's Badge back by tomorrow, or we're in trouble.\nPhoenix:\nI know. I know. (I'm gonna have to try and find out where that monkey hid it...)\n\nDecember 29, 9:43 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 5\nMax:\n...\nPhoenix:\nGood morning Max.\nMax:\n...\nMaya:\nMax?\nMax:\nMil... Milk...\nMaya:\nWhat?\nMax:\nIf I don't have a glass of milk before I go on stage... I just can't function sweetie.\nMaya:\nSt-Stage? Don't worry... There won't be a stage. All you have to do is sit down.\nMax:\nI guess...\nMaya:\nNick. Max is really nervous.\nPhoenix:\nThat's understandable.\nMax:\nHey! My sweeties!!\nPhoenix:\nW-What!?\nMax:\nYou don't think I should fly, do you?\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMax:\nYou know... You've got to make a good first impression! When I enter the room, maybe I should fly in and warm up the crowd a little...\nPhoenix:\nNo no no no no... We can't be having you flying around the courtroom... It just wouldn't be right. Imagine if you hit someone!\nMaya:\nDon't worry Max... Just do what Nick says and everything will be OK.\nMax:\nOh sweetie!!\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it this time, Max?\nMax:\nWhy don't you try flying into the courtroom?\nPhoenix:\n...\nMax:\nI can see it now... The dashing young lawyer flying fabulously in from above! One glimpse of that, and everyone in the room will be on your side!\nMaya:\nMax... Really... No one needs to fly today. ... Nick? What's with that look in your eyes?\nPhoenix:\n(I like the sound of that... \"Dashing young lawyer flying fabulously...\")\nDecember 29, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2\nJudge:\nAnd now the case of one... ............\nPhoenix:\n............\nvon Karma:\n............\nJudge:\n............ What!?\nvon Karma:\nYour Honor! Get on with it!\nJudge:\nOh... Sorry... I just realized that the defendant's name is Billy Bob Johns.\nPhoenix:\nSo...\nJudge:\nWell, isn't the defendant also known as Maximillion Galactica?\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor, he does often go by that name.\nJudge:\nYou know, my grandchild is a huge fan of his. I think everyone here wouldn't mind if we call the defendant Maximillion Galactica... It sounds more... Friendly.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I wonder if that is to our advantage?)\nJudge:\nMs. von Karma. Your opening statement if you please.\nvon Karma:\n...I hope you didn't bother thinking you'd win this one Mr. Phoenix Wright.\nPhoenix:\nEh?\nvon Karma:\nThat spirit channeling trial was a sham! I refuse to acknowledge its legitimacy! It did not count! Do you hear me!?\nPhoenix:\n(She must still be upset about what happened last time...)\nvon Karma:\nYou have no chance. Zero. Zilch. Nada. I'm not losing this case! Why, you ask? Because it is not in the nature of a Von Karma to lose at anything!!\nMaya:\nI guess being born with the name Von Karma is a free pass to be arrogant and annoying.\nvon Karma:\nWatch and learn, Mr. Phoenix Wright! I'll show you the textbook procedure for proving how absolutely guilty you are!!\nPhoenix:\nM-M-M-Me!? ... Guilty!? What are you talking about!?\nvon Karma:\n...It will be my ultimate revenge...\nMaya:\nBut it's not like it'll bring her dad back... (Changed from [Her dad is gone you know...] in the original release)\nvon Karma:\nThere. Opening statement complete. Now, let's hurry and wrap up this waste of time. (Chagned from [The prosecution is finished. Let's hurry and wrap up this waste of time.] in the original release)\nJudge:\nVery well. You may call your first witness Ms. von Karma. (Changed from [You may call your first witness Ms. von Karma.] in the original release)\nvon Karma:\nDetective Dick Gumshoe! Get up there! NOW!!\nvon Karma:\nSorry to keep you from work, as I'm sure you need every penny you can earn, Detective.\nGumshoe:\nDon't mention it! It's no trouble at all! I've been looking forward to this.\nvon Karma:\nVery well. I would like you to begin by shedding light on the events in question.\nGumshoe:\nAt your service, sir.\nJudge:\nAlright, Detective. You may proceed with your testimony.\nWitness Testimony\n-- Details of the Events --\nGumshoe:\nThe night of the crime, snow was falling until 9:40 PM, making it extremely cold out.\nAll of the circus performers gathered in the Big Top to practice their routines.\nThe practice session broke up around 10 PM.\nThe murder itself took place in the plaza in front of the lodging house at 10:15 PM.\nThe victim was found bent over a wooden box dead as a doornail.\nThe cause of death was blunt force trauma that snapped a vertebrae in his neck.\nJudge:\nI see... He was beaten to death.\nGumshoe:\nHere is the autopsy report for the victim.\nJudge:\nThe court accept [sic] this into evidence.\nAutopsy Report added to the Court Record.\nJudge:\nA blunt object... Hmm... Very well... Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.\nCross Examination\n-- Details of the Events --\nGumshoe:\nThe night of the crime, snow was falling until 9:40 PM, making it extremely cold out.\nGumshoe:\nAll of the circus performers gathered in the Big Top to practice their routines.\nGumshoe:\nThe practice session broke up around 10 PM.\nGumshoe:\nThe murder itself took place in the plaza in front of the lodging house at 10:15 PM.\nGumshoe:\nThe victim was found bent over a wooden box dead as a doornail.\nGumshoe:\nThe cause of death was blunt force trauma that snapped a vertebrae in his neck.\nMaya:\nThere wasn't much that we could go after Gumshoe with this time...\nPhoenix:\nHe gave us the facts, as he saw them. But there's gotta be more to this.\nMaya:\nI didn't see anything... But that's why you're the lawyer and I'm the medium.\nAfter pressing first and sixth statements and selecting \"About the contents\" upon pressing fifth statement:\nJudge:\nWell, I think we have a good feel for the details of the event now.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess that's all we're gonna get out of Gumshoe in this case...)\nMaya:\nYou mean all we're gonna get out of him is that little bottle of pepper?\nvon Karma:\nNow that we have wrapped up with the Detective, I'd like to call my next witness.\nGumshoe:\nEh? I'm not even off the stand yet!\nvon Karma:\nObviously... But that's due to you being slow and unable to take a hint!\nGumshoe:\nI dunno, but \"wrapped up\" has such a mean sound to it... I'm a sensitive guy...\nJudge:\nThank you very much, Detective Gumshoe. You may step down. Ms. von Karma. Call your next witness.\nvon Karma:\nI would like to call Mr. Benjamin Woodman to the stand.\nPhoenix:\n(She must be talking about Ben the ventriloquist...)\nMaya:\nI wonder if Trilo will show up on the stand as well...?\nvon Karma:\nPlease state your name and occupation for the record.\nTrilo:\nMy full name is Trilo Quist. I am employed as an opera tenor.\nJudge:\nEx-Excuse me! The witness called to the stand was one Mr. Benjamin Woodman, Ventriloquist.\nTrilo:\nThat robe must be cutting off your circulation. I said that I was a singer!! Maybe you don't believe me. Fine. I'll grace you with a song. *Ahem*... Mi mi mi mi mi! The world of the law... Exciting and daring... Guilt or innocence... Decided by a judge dressed up like a woman!! ...Well, what do you think?\nvon Karma:\n...\nJudge:\n...\nMaya:\nIt had a good rhythm...\nPhoenix:\nIt's just the lyrics... They leave something to be desired, so to speak.\nBen:\nT-Trilo! You know better than to insult a judge!!\nTrilo:\nShuddup! Just look at your nose. You would think you'd have the sense to fix it!! It's so ugly I want to punch you in the face on the off change swelling would help. You know that your nose is the reason you'll never be an A-List star.\nMaya:\nCelebrities must really enjoy saying everything that flashes into their minds.\nJudge:\nWhat's going on here!? Order! Order! I demand to know who the witness is!!\nBen:\nDon't... Don't worry about me, sir. I'll let Trilo handle this.\nJudge:\nI'm not worried about you one bit... I'm worried about getting testimony in my court! OUCH!!\nvon Karma:\nYou won't get anywhere trying to figure out this witness! Now let's proceed!\nWitness Testimony\n-- What You Witnessed --\nTrilo:\nOnce practice was over, I left the tent with the stooge... I mean clown.\nOnce we got to the lodging house, I ditched him and went back to the plaza's entrance. (Changed from [Once we got to the lodging house, I ditched him and went over to the plaza.] in the original release)\nThat's when I saw Max, heading towards the scene of the crime.\nHe was the only one heading that way... How could that punk not be the killer!?\nThen the police showed up, and took magic boy away.\nvon Karma:\nYou saw Maximillion Galactica heading towards the scene? You're sure of that?\nTrilo:\nWithout a doubt. He had on his silk hat, cloak, and the dumb white roses on his chest. How can you mistake someone with that crazy get-up and his nose stuck up so high...\nJudge:\nTh-That's enough... I think we all get the picture. Just one thing... You said you \"ditched\" the clown.\nTrilo:\nThat's right, dress-boy.\nJudge:\nWell, since you weren't with him, couldn't that mean the clown committed the crime?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... He's got a point.)\nvon Karma:\nWhat a shame... It was a nice theory, but the clown can't be the criminal.\nJudge:\nWhy's that?\nvon Karma:\nHere's absolute proof.\nJudge:\nA... silk hat?\nvon Karma:\nThis was found at the scene of the crime. It belongs to the defendant.\nPhoenix:\nAh...\nvon Karma:\nWithout question, he was wearing his signature hat during practice. If the clown was the murderer, there would be no reason for this hat to be at the scene.\nJudge:\nHmm... Well done, Ms. von Karma. Your prosecutorial skills are unrivaled. Well done.\nvon Karma:\nThank you for stating the obvious... Mr. Phoenix Wright, what do you have to say?\nPhoenix:\nO-OK... (I guess she's the boss again today...)\nCross Examination\n-- What You Witnessed --\nTrilo:\nOnce practice was over, I left the tent with the stooge... I mean clown.\nTrilo:\nOnce we got to the lodging house, I ditched him and went back to the plaza's entrance. (Changed from [Once we got to the lodging house, I ditched him and went over to the plaza.] in the original release)\nTrilo:\nThat's when I saw Max, heading towards the scene of the crime.\nTrilo:\nHe was the only one heading that way... How could that punk not be the killer!?\nTrilo:\nThen the police showed up, and took magic boy away.\nMaya:\nHmm... Trilo wouldn't happen to have an ulterior motive for incriminating Max, would he?\nPhoenix:\nWell, Max is part of that bitter love triangle with Regina. Which is probably why Max conked him over the head.\nMaya:\nUmm Nick... Wasn't Ben the one who got knocked over the head?\nPhoenix:\nUh... Yeah... I think so... I dunno anymore!\nPhoenix:\nAlright! There is obviously a reason why this witness was there that night! He spent all that time waiting for Regina to arrive! Moreover... Even if someone else would've walked right in front of him, I doubt he would have paid them a second thought!\nTrilo:\nAHHHH!!\nJudge:\nThat makes perfect sense.\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nWhat did you just say!? The witness saw the defendant at the scene of the crime!!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHowever, he did not see the victim on the way to his eventual demise! If you accept that, then you must accept that there is a high likelihood that... He could have missed someone else other than Max heading to the scene! OWWW!!\nvon Karma:\nThere is absolutely no proof that the witness was waiting for the animal tamer!\nTrilo:\nUmm... Umm... I guess you got me... Alright! Alright! I'll spill the beans for real this time! It's true. I was waiting for Regina.\nBen:\nPAIN!!\nvon Karma:\nDon't volunteer things!!\nJudge:\nMr. Quist, tell us the truth this time... And I mean the whole truth! Were you or were you not waiting for Regina at the entrance to the lodging house?\nTrilo:\nI was! I was waiting to propose to her!!\nJudge:\nYou were what!? Waiting to... propose!?\nTrilo:\nWhat's the matter!? You think that humans have a monopoly on marriage!?\nJudge:\nThat... The matter of puppet marriage is not under review in this case!\nTrilo:\nYou're the judge! I mean, look at your horrible outfit!!\nBen:\nMORE PAIN!!\nvon Karma:\nHmph. Thanks to your bumbling, my perfect plan is not so perfect anymore! Now we have to waste time getting to the bottom of some silly proposal by a puppet!!\nWitness Testimony\n-- About the Proposal --\nTrilo:\nDon't be so surprised that I was going to propose to Regina!\nI even had something to give to her...\nI kept it in my pocket, waiting for the chance to propose and give it to her.\nOf course, I also had it in my pocket that night. It was a present for her.\nIn the end, I wasn't able to give it to her, so I've still got it in my pocket!\nJudge:\nYou were going to propose... You... A puppet...\nTrilo:\nDon't be so obtuse! Just because I'm a puppet doesn't mean I can't love!\nJudge:\nI guess you're right... Just because I'm old doesn't mean I couldn't propose to her too!\nTrilo:\nExactly!\nPhoenix:\n(His Honor is looking a little less than honorable right now...)\nJudge:\nOK, Mr. Wright... Please continue with your examination... *sigh*\nMaya:\nWhat was with that sigh at the end... (Changed from [Aww... Did you hear that? His sigh seemed a little wistful.] in the original release)\nCross Examination\n-- About the Proposal --\nTrilo:\nDon't be so surprised that I was going to propose to Regina!\nTrilo:\nI even had something to give to her...\nTrilo:\nI planned on giving an engagement ring to Regina...\nTrilo:\nI kept it in my pocket, waiting for the chance to propose and give it to her.\nTrilo:\nOf course, I also had it in my pocket that night. It was a present for her.\nTrilo:\nIn the end, I wasn't able to give it to her, so I've still got it in my pocket!\nMaya:\nHow about it Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI think it's time to unwrap this toy's testimony.\nMaya:\nThat's the spirit Nick! Give him heck!\nPhoenix:\n(The judge has that dazed and confused look again. Maybe he should get out more.) (Changed from [Uh oh, the judge has that dazed look again. Maybe he should get out more.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nTrilo, do you mind if I show you something?\nBen:\nWhat is it?\nTrilo:\nWhat are you talking about!?\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh... Looks like they're going to double team me now...) Do you recognize this ring?\nTrilo:\nAh! That's... That's... That's mine!! Give it back! Thief! Thief!\nPhoenix:\nDidn't you just testify about this very object? I believe you said... \"In the end, I wasn't able to give it to her, so I've still got it in my pocket!\" Why then, do I have it right here...?\nTrilo:\nAAAAAAAAAARRRRRGHHHHH!!\nJudge:\nWhat is going on here!?\nTrilo:\nThat's... That's... Ben! Say something!!\nBen:\nEh? Don't put me on the spot like that Trilo!!\nPhoenix:\nI found this in Money's room...\nJudge:\nM-M-Money's room? You mean a room they put money, like a bank vault?\nTrilo:\nHah! That filthy monkey is gonna get what's coming to him!!\nJudge:\nMr. Quist, I would prefer if you avoided slandering innocent fiats in my court.\nPhoenix:\nWell, Your Honor... Money really is a monkey... In every sense of the word.\nJudge:\nAh. I see... Well then...\nPhoenix:\nMoney likes to go after the shiniest things that he can find and gather them up.\nJudge:\nShiny... Things?\nPhoenix:\nTrilo! When was this ring stolen from you?\nBen:\nWell... I suppose it was... That time... You know... That night... The night of the crime...\nvon Karma:\nWhat did you just say!?\nPhoenix:\nDetails... I need more details...\nBen:\nWell... It was stolen right after Max showed up in the plaza...\nPhoenix:\nRight about when you saw the defendant walk past, correct?\nBen:\nWell... Umm... I guess you... Might... Umm... Be able to say that... The ring might have... Well... It could have been... Taken around that time...\n???:\nOooo-Ooooh!\nBen:\nAhhhhh... Yeowwwwwwwww... Ohhhhhhhhhh...\nTrilo:\nBen! What's with you!? ... Oh, whatever... It has nothing to do with anything! Especially not who committed the murder!!\nPhoenix:\nIt's not for you to decide what has to do with what! Now, Trilo! Back to the topic at hand!\nTrilo:\nI haven't admitted a thing! Not I... Mr. Trilo Quist!\nPhoenix:\nWhat did you do when the ring was taken, Trilo?\nTrilo:\nYou know exactly what I did! I chased after that ring snatching monkey Money!!\nPhoenix:\nBut you weren't able to catch up with him, were you?\nTrilo:\nIt's all this slow loafy fool called Ben's fault! While he was fumbling his way through the snow, that dumb monkey was able to get away!\nJudge:\nThat is indeed an incredible shame.\nPhoenix:\nWell... This does indeed prove one very important point.\nvon Karma:\nProve an important point!? What point could that possibly be?\nPhoenix:\nThere is a huge contradiction in this witness's testimony!\nvon Karma:\nCo-Contradiction!?\nPhoenix:\nThe witness just testified to the following effect -- Up until the police arrived, he didn't move from the entrance to the plaza. HOWEVER! The witness just stated that he chased after Money the monkey. When the witness was off chasing Money, there was no one watching the plaza!\nvon Karma:\nWhat is the meaning of all this, Mr. Phoenix Wright!? Where are you going with this little theory of yours?\nPhoenix:\nI'm saying that there is no possible way that this witness saw the plaza the entire time! That's where I'm going with this little theory! Which leads me to my next point. It is entirely possible that someone other than the defendant was at the scene!\nJudge:\nInteresting, Mr. Wright.\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nWell then tell me this, Mr. Phoenix Wright!! Do you have any proof that something slipped past this vigilant ventriloquist?\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWell, he obviously didn't see the victim, the Ringmaster, arrive on the scene!\nvon Karma:\nHowever, that doesn't change the fact that he saw the defendant arrive!\nPhoenix:\nThe witness is lying! He is blinded by his rivalry with Max!\nJudge:\nWell... The defense's argument does hold water. This witness does have a history of animosity towards the defendant.\nTrilo:\nWhat!? How dare you!? I wouldn't lie just to get that dorkface in trouble! He's not even worth it!! I saw him! No doubt about it! I saw that worthless liar!\nJudge:\nWell... Just for clarity's sake, let's flesh out exactly who you saw on that night.\nTrilo:\nHah! I've told you so many times, you'd think you'd know my story's not changing!\nPhoenix:\n(You've already changed your story, stick boy! And I'm sure it will change some more.)\nMaya:\nWhere there is one lie, there are usually many more behind it.\nPhoenix:\nExactly, Maya. That's why we have to keep after him!\nMaya:\nYeah!\nWitness Testimony\n-- Witnessing Max --\nTrilo:\nI'll give you that I was waiting that night for Regina.\nBut that doesn't change the fact that I saw Max in the plaza that night!\nHe showed up after I had been waiting there for about five minutes.\nI said \"good evening\" to him, but he didn't even acknowledge my presence!\nI'm absolutely sure it was him! I saw Maximillion Galactica at the scene!!\nThere's no way I could mistake someone wearing those three ridiculous symbols!\nJudge:\nHmm...\nvon Karma:\nSo that means that Money didn't show up until after you saw Max?\nTrilo:\nThat's right. Money ran up less than a minute after I saw Max.\nPhoenix:\nThen Money snatched the ring, and you went chasing after him?\nJudge:\nHow long was it until you came back to where you were waiting?\nTrilo:\nWell. Let's see... I'd say about...\nBen:\nI suppose five minutes. I think...\nvon Karma:\nSo the victim could have arrived on the scene in that five minute stretch.\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, please proceed with your cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- Witnessing Max --\nTrilo:\nI'll give you that I was waiting that night for Regina.\nTrilo:\nBut that doesn't change the fact that I saw Max in the plaza that night!\nTrilo:\nHe showed up after I had been waiting there for about five minutes.\nTrilo:\nI said \"good evening\" to him, but he didn't even acknowledge my presence!\nTrilo:\nI'm absolutely sure it was him! I saw Maximillion Galactica at the scene!!\nTrilo:\nThere's no way I could mistake someone wearing those three ridiculous symbols!\nMaya:\nThere has to be a hole in his testimony somewhere.\nPhoenix:\nI agree. But do we have the proof to make something stick?\nMaya:\nAll we can do is try, right Nick!? We've gotta have something that will prove useful.\nPhoenix:\nAll right, time to go to work.\nPhoenix:\nTrilo, is it not true that you had a fight with Max on the day of the murder?\nvon Karma:\nA fight?\nPhoenix:\nA fight over Regina to be exact.\nTrilo:\nIt wasn't that big of a deal! It was just an argument... A disagreement at most!\nPhoenix:\nA disagreement usually doesn't end with someone getting clonked over the head...\nTrilo:\nAHHHH!!\nPhoenix:\nThat morning, Ben got clobbered over the head by Max, didn't he?\nJudge:\nWh-What? Is that an admission of assault and battery? OUCH!!\nvon Karma:\nBefore we handle that, we should wrap up the defendant's murder charge first!\nPhoenix:\nThe truth is that on the day of the crime, the defendant and witness had a huge fight! There is absolutely no way they would have suddenly become cordial that evening! Moreover, just consider the personality of the witness on stand! There is no way a puppet this lewd would just up and say \"good evening\" to his rival!\nTrilo:\nGWWAAAAHHHH!!\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nAre you saying this witness is lying!? That he is trying to frame the defendant by claiming to have seen him at the crime scene!?\nTrilo:\nI-I-I... I didn't tell a single lie! Honestly! I just...\nJudge:\nThat's enough from you Mr. Quist! Mr. Wright...\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nLet's clarify this testimony for the court... Could you explain your theory about who the witness actually saw that night?\nPhoenix:\nIt is my belief that the witness did indeed see someone that night... It was just someone else! That's who he said \"good evening\" to.\nvon Karma:\nWhat kind of theory is that!?\nPhoenix:\nThe correct one. Furthermore, I don't believe the person the witness saw was Max at all.\nvon Karma:\nWh-What!?\nPhoenix:\nIf he had truly met Max that night, there would have been no greeting at all. Which means there is only one proper answer. The person the witness saw that night was not Maximillion Galactica. That is why Trilo made the effort to greet whoever it was that he saw that evening. Or \"good evening\" as he put it.\nTrilo:\nUhh...\nvon Karma:\nWhat in the world... You...\nJudge:\nWould the defense kindly explain who it was Trilo saw that evening then?\nPhoenix:\nConsidering the ill temper of this witness, there is only one person he would greet!\nJudge:\nIt must be Regina! It's Regina right!? She's so cute!!\nPhoenix:\nNo, Your Honor, it is not Regina. If it was Regina, Trilo would have given her the engagement ring as a present.\nJudge:\nOh... Yeah... I suppose you've got a point there.\nvon Karma:\nIt was Russell Berry. The victim himself, was it not?\nPhoenix:\nYou are correct. It was indeed Russell Berry.\nTrilo:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nThe person you saw that evening was the victim, the Ringmaster, Russell Berry. That's why you greeted him Trilo. Isn't that correct?\nTrilo:\n... *gulp*\nPhoenix:\nAnswer the question, Mr. Quist!\nTrilo:\nWAAAAHHHH!! AH!\nJudge:\nORDER! ORDER! How do you respond to this!?\nTrilo:\nWa-Wait a second!! Well, at first I thought it was the old man! But! But! Once I got a better look at him, it was obviously Maximillion Galactica!\nJudge:\nI think it is high time that we clear the air about this question! Mr. Quist obviously witnessed a single person in the area of the plaza that evening. The problem is identifying exactly who that person was... Was it Maximillion Galactica? Or was it the Ringmaster, one Mr. Russell Berry?\nvon Karma:\nThe prosecution argues that it was the defendant that the witness saw that night! The witness has clearly stated that he saw the defendant's three symbols!\nPhoenix:\nThree symbols?\nTrilo:\nAlright... This is getting old. C'mon man! You've gotta remember them by now!! Here we go again! Everyone... All together now!! OWWWWW!!\nvon Karma:\nYes, yes... We know... The silk hat, cloak, and white roses...\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nA silk hat and a cloak! Anyone could wear them! They'd even look good on me!\nvon Karma:\nWhat was that!?\nPhoenix:\nWell, the witness has endlessly repeated that he saw Max's three symbols... However, how do we really know it was Maximillion Galactica? It could have been someone else, dressed up as him. Possibly even Russell Berry!\nvon Karma:\nWHAT!?\nJudge:\nMs. von Karma.\nvon Karma:\n...\nJudge:\nDo you have clear evidence that the person the witness saw was the defendant?\nvon Karma:\nWell... I...\nJudge:\nIf that's the case, then it is impossible for me to make a judgment at this point.\nPhoenix:\n(Yes! I think we've finally won a point in this one!!)\nvon Karma:\n... That is very... Unfortunate.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nvon Karma:\nYou're just a little too excited for your own good, Mr. Phoenix Wright.\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean by that?\nvon Karma:\nYou merely established one thing from this witness. You established that this witness saw one person in the plaza that night. I applaud you on your effort, but...\nJudge:\nBut...?\nvon Karma:\nWho that person was can only be answered by the next witness!\nPhoenix:\nHUH!?\nvon Karma:\nYour Honor, the prosecution will provide, beyond a shadow of a doubt, an answer to that question, and evidence that clearly establishes one thing. That there is no one other than Maximillion Galactica responsible for this crime!\nJudge:\nVery well. The court will take a 10 minute recess. During that time, I request the prosecution prepare their next witness. Court is now in recess!\nTo be continued.\nDecember 29, 11:54 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 5\nMax:\nSw-Sweetie! You have to believe me! I didn't go anywhere near that crime scene!\nMaya:\nSo then, where were you when the murder took place?\nMax:\nWe talked about it yesterday, remember? I was in the Ringmaster's room!\nPhoenix:\nAnd while you were there, it was the Ringmaster who left the room, right?\nMax:\nExactly. He told me to wait in the room because he would \"be right back\".\nMaya:\nThat's when the Ringmaster headed to the scene of the crime... Right?\nPhoenix:\nThat's what it seems like.\nMaya:\nBut... The Ringmaster must've been wearing Max's costume. Right?\nMax:\nOh! Sweetie! I just remembered! I went straight to the Ringmaster's room still dressed in my stage clothes. But when I got there, I went ahead and took the costume off.\nMaya:\nWhich means?\nPhoenix:\nIt means that the Ringmaster could have taken his costume, and went out looking like Max!\nMax:\nFABULOUS! That's a fabulously possible possibility!\nMaya:\nHeh Heh... Well done, Nick.\nMax:\nHowever, sweetie... Why would the Ringmaster want to dress up like me? Isn't that a bit strange?\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\nMax:\nIf you think about it, all they found at the crime scene was my silk hat. What about my cloak? Where did that go?\nPhoenix:\nDouble hmm...\nMaya:\nWow Max. I never thought of that. You should be a detective or something!\nMax:\nWell, I was never quite sure what to be when I grew up... Magician or President? You have no idea how hard it was to make a decision!\nMaya:\nThat's really cool...\nPhoenix:\n(Fabulous... This mystery just keeps getting deeper...)\nDecember 29, 12:06 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2\nJudge:\nNow that everyone is back, let's get started. The court is now back in session.

Name and occupation.\nJudge:\nWill the witness please inform the court why he is speaking autobiographical gibberish?\nMoe:\nO-Oh... I-I'm sorry... I'm just not used to being in court. I've never been in a courtroom in my life. I wasn't quite sure what joke is best suited to this sort of occasion.\nJudge:\nWhat in the world are you talking about!? You're in a grand hall of justice, not some comedy club! Since it's easy to see your occupation, please state your name for the court.\nMoe:\n... Oh... Yeah... Maybe this joke is OK... \"Mom, do I have to wear pants?\" \"The sign only says no shirt, no shoes, no service.\" Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\n.....................\nMoe:\nOK! OK! How about this? \"Have you met my proctologist? Dr. Seymour Butts!!\" How was that one!? Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! ...But a couple of clowns who were up to no good... Started makin' trouble in... (Changed from [...But a couple of clowns, they were up to no good... Started makin' trouble in...] in the original release)\nvon Karma:\nYour name...\nMoe:\nLawrence Curls. Professional funnyman, also known as Moe the clown.\nvon Karma:\nYou witnessed the scene at around 10:15 PM the day of the murder. Correct?\nMoe:\nYes... Yes it is.\nJudge:\nVery well, Mr. Curls. Will you please testify to what you saw that evening?\nMoe:\nA rabbi, a priest, and a Rastafarian walked into this plaza...\nJudge:\nWithout the humor please.\nMoe:\nOK...\nMaya:\nAww... Poor Moe can't be his normal stoogey self in court.\nWitness Testimony\n-- What You Witnessed --\nMoe:\nI know... I know... I'm not the greatest comedian in the world...\nI haven't been able to make people laugh for 10 years!\nNo matter what I say, all I get in return is a vacant stare and polite applause.\nSince no one ever laughs at my jokes, I've taken to laughing at them myself.\nIt's a bad habit, but hey, at least I'm trying!!\nImagine my predicament! I'm a clown who can't make people laugh!! I'm almost useless!\nBut I keep trying... I even tried to come up with jokes just for today!!\nBut this atmosphere is very nerve-racking! I decided to try making everyone laugh!\nSeriously... Everyone... What do you think of me? How am I doing?\nJudge:\n...\nvon Karma:\n...\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Aren't we the ones supposed to be asking the questions here?\nvon Karma:\nWitness...\nMoe:\nHuh?\nvon Karma:\nWe will listen to your call for help after the court proceedings are over. Thus, please stick with the facts of this case.\nMoe:\nReally!? You'll really hear me out!?\nvon Karma:\nWell, I'll make sure that one of my staff will be your straight man later.\nMoe:\nThank you!! Thank you!! I can't wait!!\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Gumshoe...)\nJudge:\nNow that that's settled, shall we begin once again with the testimony!?\nMoe:\nOf course we can! I'll talk for as long as you want!!\nWitness Testimony\n-- What You Witnessed --\nMoe:\nThe night of the murder, after practice was over, I went straight back to my room.\nYou have no idea how tired I was that night. I was pooped.\nI thought I'd go straight to sleep, but before I did, I glanced out the window.\nThat's when I saw two silhouettes! They were a bit far away though!\nIt was the Ringmaster, and he was with Max, who was wearing his cloak!\nI kept watching them, and all of a sudden, Max clonked the Ringmaster over the head!\nJudge:\nThat's very interesting... If this eyewitness account is to be believed, I have enough to pass judgment right now...\nvon Karma:\nOf course you can! There is no way that this account can be criticized.\nJudge:\nHowever... The witness is a bit, how do you say, \"off-kilter\"... Almost like he has some sort of atmosphere of guilt surrounding him.\nMoe:\nAha! Aha! Aha! That must be because of my insincere smile...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, please begin the defense's cross-examination.\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.\nMaya:\nNick! You've gotta find some kind of contradiction in his testimony!\nPhoenix:\nI know that!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor?\nJudge:\nI'm afraid that if you push this witness too far, it would bring disaster upon the court. Thus, I sincerely hope you are not going to engage in pointless saber-rattling.\nPhoenix:\nI understand, Your Honor.\nvon Karma:\nIf you cause this clown to stray from the facts, I'll hold you responsible!\nPhoenix:\n(Why am I responsible!? I'm not the one with the corny jokes.)\nCross Examination\n-- What You Witnessed --\nMoe:\nThe night of the murder, after practice was over, I went straight back to my room.\nMoe:\nYou have no idea how tired I was that night. I was pooped.\nMoe:\nI thought I'd go straight to sleep, but before I did, I glanced out the window.\nMoe:\nI heard a huge noise outside the window, and that's what made me take a look outside...\nMoe:\nThat's when I saw two silhouettes! They were a bit far away though!\nMoe:\nIt was the Ringmaster, and he was with Max, who was wearing his cloak!\nMoe:\nI kept watching them, and all of a sudden, Max clonked the Ringmaster over the head!\nMaya:\nYou know... Moe's testimony and what he told us yesterday are kinda different...\nPhoenix:\nYeah I noticed. We've just got to pinpoint what's changed.\nMaya:\nYou can do it, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nI've got a great reason to make my claim!\nvon Karma:\nAnd I suppose you will be telling us all that \"great\" reason?\nPhoenix:\nOf course I will... The reason is... The witness' very own testimony!\nJudge:\nWhat is the meaning of that Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nMoe said that he heard a sound like a \"thump\" of someone getting hit.\nJudge:\nHmm... He did say that.\nPhoenix:\nHowever, Moe just stated the following under oath.\nMoe:\nI kept watching them, and all of a sudden, Max clonked the Ringmaster over the head!\nPhoenix:\nIf Moe is to be believed when he says he looked out the window upon hearing a sound, there is no way that he could have seen Max \"clonk\" anyone!\nMoe:\nIn 1972, a crack clown unit was sent to prison by a circus court for a crime...\nJudge:\nMr. Curls! How do you respond to Mr. Wright's assessment!!?\nMoe:\n...they didn't commit. These clowns promptly escaped from a maximum security clown car...\nJudge:\nMr. Curls, are you reciting the C-Team theme to anger this court?\nMoe:\nNo no no... I'm just stalling for time while I jog my memory...\nMaya:\nGreat job, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nThese types of witnesses always seem to have a selective memory... You just have to peel back the layers of the clown make-up to find the truth.\nMoe:\nWell... Umm...\nJudge:\nAhh, you're back from your jog?\nMoe:\nWell... It pretty much happened the way I said.\nPhoenix:\n\"Pretty much\"...?\nMoe:\nWhen I looked out my window that night, the Ringmaster was already face down in the snow. The prosecution helped me fill in the gaps of my statement.\nPhoenix:\n(Von... Von Karma!! Tampering with witnesses again!!)\nvon Karma:\n...\nJudge:\nSo now you are saying that you did not see the defendant \"clonk\" the Ringmaster?\nMoe:\nY-Yes... When I looked out my window, the Ringmaster had already checked out.\nJudge:\nChecked out?\nMoe:\nYep. He was on permanent vacation as they say. Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nJudge:\nMr. Curls!!\nMoe:\nYour Honor?\nJudge:\nYou did not witness the actual crime; however, you still say you saw the criminal, correct?\nMoe:\nY-Y-YES!! Exactly! The Ringmaster was slumped over and I saw someone's silhouette next to him.\nJudge:\nVery well. Then please testify to this silhouette you saw... I expect the truth! And if I even catch a hint of a joke from you... I will put you in a holding cell until you learn court etiquette, got it!?\nMoe:\nGot it.\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Silhouette --\nMoe:\nI was a bit far away, but that shadow could only have belonged to Max.\nThere's no doubting it. Especially since I saw his uppity symbols.\nHis silk hat. That black cloak. They were all there!\nHis face was silhouetted, but there was no doubt that it was him.\nHis cloak was fluttering in the wind, so I couldn't really see what he was carrying.\nJudge:\nHmm... It does seem as if the defendant was at the scene of the crime.\nvon Karma:\nIt took the clown long enough to get his facts straight. (Changed from [You took your time realizing that, didn't you!?] in the original release) But whatever. This should finally be good enough, yes? (Changed from [Whatever. That should be enough, right!?] in the original release)\nJudge:\nIt is decisive testimony...\nMaya:\nWas Max really at the crime scene that night...?\nPhoenix:\nHe said he wasn't there. We have to believe in that. (Changed from [He said he wasn't there. We have to keep believing that.] in the original release)\nJudge:\nAlright, Mr. Wright. Commence your cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- The Silhouette --\nMoe:\nI was a bit far away, but that shadow could only have belonged to Max.\nMoe:\nThere's no doubting it. Especially since I saw his uppity symbols.\nMoe:\nHis silk hat. That black cloak. They were all there!\nMoe:\nHis face was silhouetted, but there was no doubt that it was him.\nMoe:\nHis cloak was fluttering in the wind, so I couldn't really see what he was carrying.\nPhoenix:\n(With Trilo's testimony, and now Moe's... It really seems like Max is the killer.)\nMaya:\nN-Nick... You've gotta find a contradiction in this.\nPhoenix:\nThat's not going to be enough...\nMaya:\nWhat?\nPhoenix:\nI have to prove that Moe saw someone other than Max that night! That's the only thing that will help! I've gotta do it!\nPhoenix:\nYou say you saw all of Max's \"uppity\" symbols?\nMoe:\nI suppose so... The silk hat and the cloak, right?\nPhoenix:\nMoe... Everyone knows that Maximillion Galactica has three uppity symbols!\nMoe:\nThree symbols?\nMaya:\nYay! Everyone get ready!! All... Together... Now...\n\"SILK HAT! CLOAK! WHITE ROSES!\"\nMoe:\nWhat the!?\nvon Karma:\nWho cares if he knew that there were three or not! He saw what he saw. And he saw the symbols. He just forgot to mention one.\nMoe:\n...\nvon Karma:\nIsn't that right, Moe?\nMoe:\n... Do you like Pi? I love Pi! 3.141592653589793238462643383279! Tasty!\nvon Karma:\nSilence fool! You are to respond with the whole truth! No fractions!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order!\nPhoenix:\nMoe! You didn't see the roses, did you!?\nMoe:\nTo be honest... There wasn't any roses on the person I saw...\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nThe crime scene was dark! It's obvious it was too dark to see that kind of detail!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nBut the witness said he was able to see the silhouette of the criminal's face. Not to mention that the roses are white! There's no way he could have missed them!\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nThen the roses must have fallen off when the defendant assaulted the victim!\nPhoenix:\nIf that was the case, then the police would have found them near the crime scene!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Are these white roses truly material to the facts of this case?\nvon Karma:\nClearly not! He is just toying with this court!\nPhoenix:\n... (I got her on the ropes now... These seemingly insignificant facts have never failed to lead me to the truth yet! (Changed from [Whenever there's a nugget of truth, it always seems to peek out at me... Then run away.] in the original release)) Someone is toying with the court, but it's not me! Your Honor! Do you recall Trilo's testimony?\nTrilo:\nThere's no way I could mistake someone wearing those three ridiculous symbols!\nTrilo:\nHow can you mistake someone with that crazy get-up and his nose stuck up so high...\nTrilo:\nHow could you mistake someone wearing such a snobby 3 piece get-up!\nPhoenix:\nTrilo saw them all! Trilo saw all three of Max's symbols! However, this witness claims there were no white roses on the person he saw! There is absolutely no doubt that this is a contradiction!\nJudge:\nHmm... Now what am I supposed to think? One is supposed to disregard the pointless, but this...\nvon Karma:\nJudge! Forget the roses! Think about his other testimony! The witness has stated without a doubt that he saw Maximillion Galactica! Nothing else matters! Let's wrap this case up now!\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! It may be trivial, but it does cast doubt on the prosecution's case. (Changed from [Your Honor! It may be trivial, but there should still be doubt lingering in your mind!] in the original release)\nJudge:\n... Frankly, I have my doubts about this witness. It seems that, unlike wine, the witness has not grown more mature with age.\nMoe:\nI'm not... mature...\nJudge:\nI've come to a conclusion... I'm 99% certain that this witness saw the defendant. However! My remaining one percent of doubt is quite reasonable! Which means that for my peace of mind, I'm going to request a bit more testimony.\nvon Karma:\nW-What!?\nJudge:\nIf there are no contradictions in his next statement, I am prepared to issue a ruling.\nPhoenix:\n(A ruling...!!)\nMaya:\nNick! This is your last chance!\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Silhouette, Part 2 --\nMoe:\nThere's no doubt in my mind! There were no white roses that night!\nHowever, all of the other symbols were there... I'm equally sure of that.\nEspecially the silk hat! There is no way I could forget seeing the decorations on it!\nHe was wearing it the entire time that he was on the scene!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright... You've got one last chance at this.\nPhoenix:\nJust one chance?\nJudge:\nI will not allow even the slightest hint of badgering against this witness. If you are going to prove to me there's a contradiction with Mr. Curls' statement, you'd better have at least a shred of evidence to back up your accusations.\nPhoenix:\n(I've only got a single shot as [sic] this... I've got to be careful.) I understand, Your Honor. One chance is all I will need!\nCross Examination\n-- The Silhouette, Part 2 --\nMoe:\nThere's no doubt in my mind! There were no white roses that night!\nMoe:\nHowever, all of the other symbols were there... I'm equally sure of that.\nMoe:\nEspecially the silk hat! There is no way I could forget seeing the decorations on it!\nMoe:\nHe was wearing it the entire time that he was on the scene!\nMaya:\nWhaddya think, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nThere's no way I'm going to lose after coming this far. There's gotta be an answer. And it's probably in the Court Record!\nPhoenix:\nThis wouldn't happen to be the silk hat you saw that night, would it?\nMoe:\nYep! That's it! That's the hat he was wearing that night!\nPhoenix:\nNo question in your mind?\nMoe:\nExactly how would one mistake a thing like that!?\nPhoenix:\nI see...\nJudge:\nIs there some sort of problem, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nMs. von Karma. Where exactly was the silk hat found?\nvon Karma:\nMust you always ask these questions!? It was found at the crime scene!! ... The c-c-crime scene... That means...\nPhoenix:\nThe silk hat fell off at the crime scene! However the witness clearly testified to the contrary!! The witness stated that \"he was wearing it the entire time that he was on the scene!\"\nMoe:\nNoooooOOOOOooooo!! That's not trrrrrruuuuueeee!!\nJudge:\nORDER! ORDER!! OOORRRDER!! MR. CURLS!!\nMoe:\nY-Yes, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nWHAT IS THE MEANING OF ALL OF THIS!? You are old enough to know better than to behave like this in court!\nMoe:\nHey! That's just not right!! That's so harsh!\nJudge:\nWhat's not right here is your eyesight and your memory, amongst other things!!\nMoe:\n............... Wh... Why are you being so mean to me!! What did I do!? Lemme guess... You just didn't like my jokes or something, right? You didn't have to go and insult my eyesight or my memory!? They're both great! Seriously!! Why!? Just because you are sitting above me doesn't mean you belong there! And no matter how old I get, I'll always be younger than you!! WAAAAAHHHHHHHH!! *sob* (Changed from [And no matter how old I get, I'll always be younger you!! [sic] WAAAAAHHHHHHHH!! *sobs*] in the original release)\n...\nJudge:\n... Enough of these childish outbursts, Mr. Curls! Who do you think you are?\nMoe:\nI saw him! I swear I saw him!! It was Max!! Even if he didn't have his roses, he was still wearing his dumb silk hat!! I'm telling the truth!!\nMaya:\nHe's turned into a bratty little kid.\nPhoenix:\nIt's pitiful, isn't it?\nMoe:\nHe left the scene wearing that dumb silk hat! He was there!!\nPhoenix:\n(He... left the scene?)\nMaya:\nWhat's the matter, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nThere's something I've been mulling over for a while now. Moe?\nMoe:\nWhaddya want!?\nPhoenix:\nYou just said that he left the scene... Exactly how did the murderer leave the scene of the crime?\nMoe:\nWHAT!? He... Umm... He... Went... Whaddya mean \"how did he leave the scene\"? You can't ask me that!!\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nMr. Phoenix Wright is badgering the witness, Your Honor!!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThis witness's testimony is so full of holes, Ms. von Karma's protest is useless!\nvon Karma:\nGrrrr...\nJudge:\nYou've got a point. Let's hear what the witness has to say on this matter. Is that alright with you, little guy?\nMoe:\nDon't talk to me like I'm a little baby!! Besides, what kind of stupid question is \"how did he leave the crime scene!?\" The answer's obvious! He just turned around and walked away!!\nPhoenix:\nThat's what I expected you'd say... You sure that's how it happened?\nMoe:\nSay what!? (Changed from [Hmph!!] in the original release)\nJudge:\nHuh? I'm not sure I know exactly where you're going with this... Lawyers nowadays sure do love to harp on the smallest things. Do you have any proof to counter his story as to how the criminal left the scene?\nPhoenix:\nLook at this picture. The problem is the footprints in the snow...\nJudge:\nFootprints?\nPhoenix:\nIn this photo, we can clearly see the footprints of the victim! However, where are the criminal's footprints? They aren't there!!\nMoe:\nAi-yai-yai-yai-yai!!\nPhoenix:\nSo Moe, exactly how did the criminal escape the scene?\nMoe:\nUmm... He... Uh...\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! This witness has already proven that his testimony is completely unreliable! I move to strike all of this witness's testimony from the court record!\nJudge:\nI agree... This clown's testimony is as rickety as the clown car he came to court in.\nMoe:\nWAIT JUST A SECOND!! You guys can't just ignore everything I've said!! Fine fine! I'll tell you the truth this time...\nvon Karma:\nYOU WAIT A SECOND! I think you've said more than enough for today!!\nMoe:\nThat didn't hurt!! I'm sick and tired of listening to you anyways!! I'll give you the real deal this time... I swear!!\nMaya:\nI dunno why, but I get the feeling things are gonna get worse before they get better.\nJudge:\nMr. Lawrence Curls.\nMoe:\nYes!?\nJudge:\nThe testimony you've provided up until now has been false?\nMoe:\nIt hasn't been false! I haven't lied! It's just...\nJudge:\nIt's just what?\nMoe:\nIt's just I was a bit confused on the bit about the criminal leaving the scene. Especially since Von Karma and her whip told me not to talk about what I really saw!\nJudge:\nORDER!! ORDER!! I WILL HAVE ORDER!! Franziska von Karma!! How could you!!\nvon Karma:\nYour Honor... If you had heard the truth from this witness... You would have exactly the same opinion as I have.\nJudge:\nWhat opinion is that?\nvon Karma:\nIt's not funny!\nJudge:\nThat's enough out of you! I'm going to listen to what he has to say. Now then, let's hear the truth about what you say you saw, Mr. Curls! (Changed from [Now then, let's hear the truth about what you say you saw!] in the original release)\nMoe:\nHah!

He...\nThis is the truth now, get ready for it!\nHe flew! He jumped up and flew through the air!!\nHe flew right off and disappeared into the darkness!\nThat's why there were no footprints! Flying people don't leave footprints!\nvon Karma:\nI told you it wasn't funny. Do you believe me now?\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\n...\n.....................\nJudge:\nWell... That was... Umm... How do you put this into words...\nvon Karma:\nMaximillion Galactica is a world-class magician. But to leave the scene of a crime by flying -- there's no way that actually happened. (Changed from [But to leave the scene of a crime by flying. There's no way that actually happened.] in the original release)\nJudge:\nYou... You're right.\nMoe:\nWhy is she right!? You believed the other witnesses! Why won't you believe me!? Especially since it's the best part of the story!!\nJudge:\nHmm... To be honest, this is the first time I've heard of a flying criminal. What do you think about this witness' testimony, Mr. Wright?\nJudge:\nI suppose I will let you all in on my thinking regarding this matter... \"The criminal disappeared into the sky.\" I'd love to believe that... But I just can't wrap my head around how that could actually happen.\nvon Karma:\nYou imbecile!\nJudge:\nIf you disregard a need for proof, Ms. von Karma's case is sound. However... I've got the feeling that this case is in dire need of more investigation.\nvon Karma:\n...!\nJudge:\nThus I will conclude today's proceedings at this point! It's an undisputed fact that the criminal left no footprints at the scene. Tomorrow, I want us to find out the reason behind this mystery of mysteries.\nPhoenix:\nUmm, uhh...\nvon Karma:\nGrrr...\nJudge:\nI believe that's enough for today. Court is adjourned!

I can't fly whenever I please. It's not that easy!!\nMaya:\nBut it looks so effortless for you on stage...\nMax:\nIt's not that simple!! I'm not actually flying on stage!

(Changed from [But I can never figure out the tricks when I see them. I'm just not good at it...] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nThat's because the tricks are performed by pros. They do it so you can't guess the trick.\nMaya:\nBut but... The trick Pearly showed me was incredible!\nPhoenix:\nPearls did a magic trick? Hmm... What kind of trick was it?\nMaya:\nLet's see. It looked like she pulled the end of her own thumb off!\nPhoenix:\nHeh...\nMaya:\nFirst she put her right thumb next to her left hand, and then it just separated! She could move it up and down and everything! It was incredible!\nPhoenix:\nReally? Was it kinda like this...?\nMaya:\nWHAT!? WOW! HOW'D YOU DO THAT!? Nick, you're like a real magician!

I know how you feel.] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nLet me tell you something, pal. Listening to that old clown sucks all your energy. Every time he's done talkin' he looks at you like you should be doing something...\nPhoenix:\nUmm... I think he's waiting for you to laugh at his jokes.\nGumshoe:\nI know that, pal. Do you have any idea how much your face hurts if you fake laughing that much?\nMaya:\nFranziska really set you up bad this time, didn't she? If you ask me, she should be listening to Moe herself...\nGumshoe:\nNo way, pal. You're not gonna get me to backbite a woman with a whip. No way.\nMaya:\nWhy are you defending her?\nGumshoe:\nProsecutor von Karma's always got her eyes on us. And every time you definitely don't want her to show up... *poof* There she is!! Don't show up... Don't show up... Don't show up... Don't show up... Don't show up...\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like she's wound him pretty tight...)\nGumshoe:\nShe's directly above us as we speak.\nMaya:\nHuh? How's that possible?\nGumshoe:\nAccording to the clown, the criminal jumped from here and disappeared into the sky. If that's what happened, it means the killer passed right by this window, pal.\nMaya:\nOh, I see... Who lives in that room behind the window up there?\nGumshoe:\nThe acrobat's got his room up on the third floor, it seems. Pretty soon, Ms. von Karma's gonna start her investigation up there. So don't get any ideas of going up to the acrobat's room, got it pal?\nMaya:\n*shivers* F-Franziska von Karma...

I'm sure you would've heard him laughing away... \"Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\"\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you think he is laughing at when he's all by himself?\nMaya:\nI always thought he was just thinking up new jokes.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm...

It's easy!!\nPhoenix:\n...Because cafeteria Mexican pizza is possibly a weapon of bowel destruction?\nMoe:\n*BUZZ* Wrong! Try again! OK! What do you think, girlie?\nMaya:\nUmm... Ahh! I got it!!\nMoe:\nOK!! What is your answer?\nMaya:\nBecause they are in the Café Teary Eye!\nMoe:\nExactly!! It's an incredibly sad place, that café. Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!

He's used to putting his life on the line. Literally. He's got guts to spare.\nPhoenix:\nIf all I've got to worry about is how thin the tightrope is, I'm used to it already... It just means that I won't be able to press him like I can other witnesses...\nMaya:\nWhat are you going to do then, Nick!?\nPhoenix:\nI guess today we'll just have to do without our psychological warfare. Today we rely on evidence. It's the only way we'll get past Acro and to the truth.\nMaya:\nYou're right... But it's gonna be tough...\nMoe:\nAnyways... I want you to make sure that Regina see it all today. It's important. Then she'll finally have to deal with the reality of what happened to her father.\nMaya:\nYou want us to make sure Regina watches?\nMoe:\nYes. That's why I brought her here to court today.\nMax:\nWhat's that supposed to mean?\nMoe:\nShe need to know that when people die, they don't just become stars.

Ms. von Karma, you may proceed with your case.\nvon Karma:\nThe prosecution would like to revise its previous theory of events. (Changed from [The prosecution would like to revise it's [sic] previous theory of events.] in the original release)\nJudge:\nWhat's the meaning of this?\nvon Karma:\nWe have discovered a new witness. Or shall I say, a new eyewitness. One that saw Maximillion Galactica fly off from the scene of the crime.\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! I had a feeling something like this would come up...\nvon Karma:\nDue to this revision, we are now prepared to explain how the defendant flew that night. An explanation the prosecution will present if the need so [sic] arises... In fact, my detective stayed up all night creating a mockup of the scene, on my orders.\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Gumshoe...)\nJudge:\nVery well... Please call your witness to the stand!\nPhoenix:\n(Time to get to work! Or shall I say, time to walk the courtroom tightrope...)\nvon Karma:\nName and occupation.\nAcro:\nKen Dingling, but everyone calls me Acro. I'm employed as an acrobat at the Berry Big Circus.\nvon Karma:\nWhere were you the night of the crime?\nAcro:\nI was in my room that night.\nvon Karma:\nIf you look at the map, you will see the witness' room is near the crime scene.\nAcro:\nMy room is on the third floor. The crime scene is below my window.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nvon Karma:\nThe night of the crime, the witness saw something quite shocking. Would you tell us what you witnessed?\nAcro:\nOK...\nWitness Testimony\n-- What You Witnessed --\nAcro:\nIt was just after 10:00 PM, and I was resting in my bed.\nAround that time, I heard a large \"THUMP\" noise from outside the window.\nThen a few moments later, I saw someone... flying... Right by my window.\nIt was Max Galactica... I only saw him from behind, but that's who it looked like.\nTo be honest, when I saw that, I thought I was dreaming...\nJudge:\nHmm... This witness's testimony matches up exactly with that of the clown.\nvon Karma:\nIf that's the case, there is very little the prosecution need add... All that's left is to explain how the defendant disappeared into the sky that night.\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nBefore we get that far, I'd like to cross-examine the witness.\nvon Karma:\nA foolish choice by a foolish fool who wishes to feel the foolish sadness of a sad fool. A man must know the proper timing for things, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Just like your old friend, Mr. Miles Edgeworth did.\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. Do you have a problem with the witness' testimony?\nPhoenix:\nIn the words of Ms. von Karma, may I quote yesterday's proceedings... \"There's no way that actually happened!\"\nJudge:\nVery well... You may proceed with your cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- What You Witnessed --\nAcro:\nIt was just after 10:00 PM, and I was resting in my bed.\nAcro:\nAround that time, I heard a large \"THUMP\" noise from outside the window.\nAcro:\nThen a few moments later, I saw someone... Flying... Right by my window.\nAcro:\nIt was Max Galactica... I only saw him from behind, but that's who it looked like.\nAcro:\nTo be honest, when I saw that, I thought I was dreaming...\nMaya:\nAcro must be lying about what he saw, right? (Changed from [Acro must be lying about things, huh?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nOf course he is. Now the challenge will be to expose his lies in court.\nMaya:\nWell, put the pedal to the metal, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nYou claim to have seen the exact same thing Moe saw that night. Do you stand by that?\nAcro:\nWhat do you mean...?\nPhoenix:\nThe silk hat.\nAcro:\nWhat about the silk hat? I saw it on Max's head as he flew by my window.\nPhoenix:\nWell... You should have tried looking down out of your window that night.\nAcro:\nThat would have been quite difficult considering the state that I'm in. Just looking outside of the window was a tough enough challenge for me.\nPhoenix:\nThat's a shame, because you would have noticed the silk hat found on the scene.\nAcro:\nThat... That's the Ringmaster's hat... Right?\nPhoenix:\nAfraid not. No matter how you look at it, this is Max's silk hat.\nJudge:\nWhere are you going with this, Mr. Wright? Are you saying that Max has two silk hats!?\nPhoenix:\nNo. This is a handmade, one-of-a-kind model made only for Maximillion Galactica. Which means, Acro... That you've been fibbing on the stand!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order!\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nAs always, it looks like someone just had to open their mouth before thinking... (Changed from [Like always, someone has to open their mouth before thinking...] in the original release)\nMaya:\nAre you OK, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nWell, I opened my big mouth, and now I have to back it up...\nJudge:\nHow about it, Mr. Wright? What would cause this witness to commit perjury in this court today?\nPhoenix:\n... Your Honor! On this occasion, the defense accuses Acro himself!\nvon Karma:\n\"On this occasion\"...?\nJudge:\n\"A-A-Accuses Acro\"!? What in the world are you accusing him of?\nPhoenix:\nObviously we accuse him of the murder of Mr. Russell Berry!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, are you serious!?\nPhoenix:\nDeadly serious, Your Honor.\nvon Karma:\nHa ha ha... I think your trips to the circus have served you well... You seem to have learned how to try and grab at an audience's hearts and minds. (Changed from [You seem to remember how to try and grab at an audience's hearts and minds.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n...!!\nvon Karma:\nYour Honor. Don't allow yourself to be swayed by theatrics. Trying to wow the crowd with smoke and mirrors is the oldest bluff in the book.\nJudge:\nR-Really...?\nvon Karma:\nIf you don't believe me, just look at the witness. He's calm enough for it to almost be scary...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... He is staying rather calm and collected...)\nJudge:\nMr. Dingling, do you have any response to the defense's accusation?\nAcro:\nI don't really need to say a thing, do I?\nJudge:\nWhat do you mean?\nAcro:\nEveryone, take a good look at me. I can't even stand up by myself, let alone leave the lodging house.\nJudge:\nT-That's true...\nAcro:\nI understand that Mr. Wright is just trying to help his client. But to do this by accusing me of a murder of all things...\nvon Karma:\nSee! Even a sliver of common sense makes it clear the accusation is ludicrous! (Changed from [See! Even a silver [sic] of common sense makes it clear the accusation is ludicrous!] in the original release)\nShe's right! Way to pick on the disabled you heartless, cruel man!Phoenix is a poopyhead!!\nvon Karma:\nSee that, Mr. Phoenix Wright? If you're trying to drum up support from the peanut gallery, that's how you do it.\nPhoenix:\nUhh...\nvon Karma:\nI think that's enough of this little game. I've got a doctor's note to confirm that Acro is unable to stand under his own power. Maybe the defense is planning on making a claim to counter this as well? I can hear the defense now... \"Acro had an accomplice!!\"\nJudge:\nWhat do you say about this, Mr. Wright? Did Acro have an accomplice?\nvon Karma:\nNow then, this must be when we get to hear the name of the mystery accomplice!\nPhoenix:\nNot this time, Von Karma.\nvon Karma:\nWh... WHAT!?\nPhoenix:\nYou're not going to sucker me into this one.\nJudge:\nWhat are you blabbering about, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nThere was no accomplice! Acro planned and committed this murder all by himself!\nJudge:\nO-Order! Order! What the... What are you getting at!?\nMaya:\nWay to keep them on their toes, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nNow I'm going to have to prove how it all fits together... I have to show how Acro murdered Russell Berry.\nMaya:\nCan you do it Nick? Can you really do that!?\nPhoenix:\nI know what I can't do. I can't stop now... If I stop attacking, I'm doomed!\nMaya:\nAlright! Then let's do it!!\nvon Karma:\nMr. Phoenix Wright... If this witness is the killer, then his eyewitness account is all lies, right?\nJudge:\nHmm... Mr. Wright, I'd like you to clear something up for me... When the crime was committed, exactly where was Mr. Dingling?\nPhoenix:\nHe was obviously here the entire time.\nJudge:\nThat's... Acro's room?\nPhoenix:\nPretty simple, eh? Acro wasn't able to leave the lodging house by himself. In that case, there can be only one correct answer! (Changed from [There's only one answer to that...] in the original release) Acro didn't leave his room to kill the Ringmaster!\nvon Karma:\nWhat!? Are you nuts!?\nJudge:\nWhat say you, Mr. Dingling!?\nAcro:\n... It's an interesting theory.\nPhoenix:\n... Umm... That's it?\nAcro:\nConsidering that what you proposed is impossible, yes, that's it.\nJudge:\nHmm... Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nAs the witness has stated... Your assertion is impossible. As he is in a wheelchair, there is no way he could go to the scene or be the killer.\nPhoenix:\nHmm... You've got a point.\nvon Karma:\nIt seems you've forgotten once again, Mr. Phoenix Wright. The defendant was clearly spotted at the scene of the crime.\nMaya:\nThat's true! Moe said that he saw Max, didn't he?\nPhoenix:\nBut Maya, it's still impossible for humans to fly.\nAcro:\nDo you mind if I ask a question, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it?\nAcro:\nI understand some of your logic... However, how do you think that I killed him? If I can't leave my room, I obviously couldn't wear Max's costume...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... How did he do it? That's the next course of this legal buffet...)\nMaya:\nBe careful, Nick. If you mess up here...\nPhoenix:\n(She's right. I can't mess up here. I've gotta give this one some serious thought! I'm sure that Acro killed the Ringmaster... And he did it while he was in his room... No doubt about it! (Changed from [And he killed the Ringmaster while he was in his room... No doubt about it!] in the original release))\nJudge:\nTime to enlighten us as to how Mr. Dingling committed the crime, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nI'm going to present some evidence!\nJudge:\nSo what did Mr. Dingling use to commit the crime of murder against Russell Berry?\nJudge:\nWhat's that? A picture?\nPhoenix:\nIt is indeed. The problem is with the item that's shown in the picture.\nJudge:\nThe bust?\nPhoenix:\nIt's quite a large bust. And because it is life sized, it is also very, very heavy.\nvon Karma:\nHeavy...?\nPhoenix:\nHeavy enough to guarantee a certain death. Especially if it was dropped from a third story window.\nvon Karma:\nAHHH!!\nAcro:\n...\nPhoenix:\nSee! This is how Acro was able to kill the Ringmaster! With the force of gravity and Maximillion Galactica's ample bust!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! So you're saying the bust fell onto the Ringmaster!?\nPhoenix:\nA rather simple crime... Even if you were stuck in a wheelchair, it would be incredibly easy to commit...\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nHow could you possibly wheel a wheelchair with something so heavy!? It's impossible!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWell, Acro is an acrobat! He should have more than enough upper body strength to carry something like the bust!\nJudge:\nMr. Dingling, how do you respond to these charges!?\nAcro:\nWell...\nMaya:\nAcro's at a loss for words!\nPhoenix:\n(He should be... He knows that I'm getting close to the truth!) Well well well, Acro. You can't run away from things this time... OWWW!!\nvon Karma:\nI'd watch what I say, if I were you, Mr. Phoenix Wright.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!?\nvon Karma:\nYour Honor! The physical health of the witness is material to this case! I demand that we get proper testimony from the witness himself!\nJudge:\nHmm... Testimony you say...\nPhoenix:\n(Von Karma... She's just using this \"testimony\" as a rouse [sic] to stall for time!)\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThere is absolutely no need for such testimony!\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nThe defense has its version of the murder. The prosecution has the right to respond!\nJudge:\nThe defense's objection is overruled...\nPhoenix:\n(Why can't he see things my way once in a while!)\nJudge:\nMr. Dingling, I'm sorry, but we need you to testify about your physical condition. If you have any doubts about your ability to testify, we can request expert testimony.\nvon Karma:\nThe witness will have no problems; however, let's all be respectful towards him.\nAcro:\nThank you...\nPhoenix:\n(Argh! That woman will sink to any low to win a case!)\nWitness Testimony\n-- Acro's Physical State --\nAcro:\nI suppose I could have lifted something the size of that bust.\nI have a strong upper body from working as an acrobat, and only my legs were injured.\nHowever, lifting the bust and looking out of the window would've been impossible.\nThere's no way I could have exerted that kind of force on my lower body.\nThat makes it impossible for me to have known the location of the Ringmaster's head.\nThus it would be unrealistic to drop the bust on him. Don't you think?\nJudge:\nHmm... I have no doubts in regards to this witness's testimony.\nvon Karma:\nIt was impossible for him to lift the bust and stick himself out far enough to look. (Changed from [It was impossible for him to lift the bust and carry it over to the window.] in the original release) Not to mention that he could not have known the location of the Ringmaster's head. A single false step would have lead [sic] to even more severe injuries.\nJudge:\nThat's what I was thinking. What is your opinion on the matter, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\n... I'd still like to proceed with my cross-examination.\nvon Karma:\nHe's simply stalling. It's shameful, really.\nPhoenix:\n(Grr... I can't let her get to me... I've got to focus...)\nCross Examination\n-- Acro's Physical State --\nAcro:\nI suppose I could have lifted something the size of that bust.\nAcro:\nI have a strong upper body from working as an acrobat, and only my legs were injured.\nAcro:\nHowever, lifting the bust and looking out of the window would've been impossible.\nAcro:\nThere's no way I could have exerted that kind of force on my lower body.\nAcro:\nThat makes it impossible for me to have known the location of the Ringmaster's head.\nAcro:\nThus it would be unrealistic to drop the bust on him. Don't you think?\nPhoenix:\n(Acro is strong enough to lift up the bust...)\nMaya:\nThe main problem is how he could have aimed for the Ringmaster's head.\nPhoenix:\nHmm... I wonder if he used some kind of tool to aim for the Ringmaster...?\nMaya:\nThat's the ticket, Nick! Show them what you've got!\nPhoenix:\nI have to be careful. I have to find something that fits perfectly with the case.\nMaya:\nHmm... I don't remember us finding any sort of tool... But maybe we overlooked something...\nPhoenix:\nAcro... You didn't really need to lean out of the window, did you?\nAcro:\nWhat are you driving at, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nYou already knew ahead of time where the Ringmaster's head was going to be. Quite precisely, I may add.\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nYour silly hinting at things is pointless! Mr. Phoenix Wright! Enough stalling! How about you show us some evidence!\nPhoenix:\n(But... But I did such a good job hinting...)\nJudge:\nYes, yes, yes! Hurry up and explain things, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nMaybe you should take a look at this... The key point here is the \"wooden box\".\nJudge:\nThe same wooden box that the victim was found hunched over...?\nPhoenix:\nThe same. The question is, who placed the wooden box here?\nvon Karma:\nWho...?\nPhoenix:\nWhen Ben and company saw the Ringmaster, they didn't see him holding the box. Which means... That this wooden box was already placed at the scene of the crime. (Changed from [That this wooden box was already placed at the scene crime. [sic]] in the original release)\nJudge:\nI have to admit that your theory makes a lot of sense...\nPhoenix:\nThe moment that the bust came falling down... Was exactly the same moment that the Ringmaster lifted up this wooden box. Which means that the answer to all these questions is now crystal clear!\nvon Karma:\nYou... You mean!\nJudge:\nIf the bust were to fall upon the point marked out by the wooden box...\nPhoenix:\nThere would be no way that it could miss the head of the victim!\nvon Karma:\nN-No...! (Changed from [R-Really...!?] in the original release)\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order! This is unbelievable!!\nPhoenix:\n(Finally! Some of these loose ends are starting to tie themselves up! Now I just gotta keep going! And there's only one way to go from here... Forward.)\nJudge:\nSo the next question I have is, who placed that wooden box at the scene?\nPhoenix:\nIt was Mr. Dingling, of course. He connected it to a rope, and then all he had to do was lower it down. OWWW!!\nvon Karma:\nAllow me to whip some sense into you! Mr. Phoenix Wright!!\nPhoenix:\nOWWW!! OWWW!! OWWW!!\nvon Karma:\nThe Ringmaster's head could have been anywhere when he lifted the box!\nPhoenix:\nThat's why the box was so specially made!\nvon Karma:\nS-S-Specially made?\nPhoenix:\nIndeed! It had the most peculiar feature...\nJudge:\nThe box also has carrying handles on either side, doesn't it?\nPhoenix:\nThat is correct! To lift up the box, you'd have to squat down! Which means... That no matter who you are, your head would be in approximately the same place!\nvon Karma:\nFool!!\nPhoenix:\n(Does he even bother to listen to me anymore...?) (Changed from [Does she [sic] even bother to listen to me anymore...?] in the original release)\nAcro:\nI've heard what you've had to say...\nPhoenix:\n...!\nAcro:\nI must admit, I'm shocked at your imaginative skills.\nJudge:\nY-You... Did you do it? Did you place this wooden box in the plaza? (Changed from [Y-You... Did you drop it? Did you drop the bust onto the Ringmaster!?] in the original release)\nAcro:\nMr. Wright may have a vivid imagination, but I could never have done what he's proposing. (Changed from [What are you talking about!? Even if I had wanted to do such a thing, I couldn't.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nWhat...!?\nAcro:\nMr. Wright... Do you recall the original location of Max's bust? (Changed from [Mr. Wright... Do you recall the original location of this bust?] in the original release)\nAcro:\nI'd like you to remember one important fact, Mr. Wright... I could not possibly leave the lodging house by myself.\nMaya:\nAh! That means...\nAcro:\nYou understand what I mean, don't you? I may very well have been able to drop the bust from my room. However, how would I have gotten the bust from the cafeteria to my room?\nvon Karma:\nYou see, Mr. Phoenix Wright!! Explain that! Don't forget... You said, \"There was no accomplice!\"\nPhoenix:\nArrrggghhh!\nvon Karma:\nTell us exactly how the witness would have carried the bust from the cafeteria!\nPhoenix:\n(Yep... We definitely have a problem here... But this is no place to get perplexed! I've got to get my wits about me and prove how things happened once and for all!)\nJudge:\nAlright, Mr. Wright. Let's hear your explanation. How did the witness get the bust from the cafeteria back to his room?\nJudge:\nA monkey?\nPhoenix:\nEveryone knows Money... He loves shiny objects of any size.\nJudge:\nOh, like when he stole the ventriloquist's ring... (Changed from [For instance, he stole the ventriloquist's ring...] in the original release)\nvon Karma:\nSo? Are you saying the witness had a monkey steal the bust?\nPhoenix:\nOf course he didn't order the monkey to steal it!! The monkey stole it on his own and then brought it back home.\nAcro:\n...!!\nJudge:\n\"Home\"...?\nPhoenix:\nMoney lives in Acro's room.\nJudge:\nACRO'S ROOM!?\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nBut the bust was bronze, wasn't it? Bronze isn't all that shiny...\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nMaybe you should put the whip down sometimes and read the Court Record!\nJudge:\nMy, those are some very nice cards he's holding.\nPhoenix:\nYes, and they are made of platinum... which is very shiny!\nvon Karma:\nGWWWAAAAHHH!!\nPhoenix:\nAcro!! Money is a strong monkey, right!? It'd be easy for him to bring the bust back to your room!!\nAcro:\n... If he wasn't able to handle that himself, I'd be on the market for a new roommate.\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! I SAID ORDER!! MS. VON KARMA!! Where is the bust in question at this moment!?\nvon Karma:\nUmm... Umm... Umm... I... Umm... I don't know. We're searching for it as we speak...!\nJudge:\nHmm... This is a rather strange turn of events. (Changed from [Hmm... This is a strange turn of events.] in the original release) But let's say that the monkey had not stolen the bust... (Changed from [If that monkey did not steal the bust...] in the original release) What would have happened then? (Changed from [Then what happens to this case?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nWell, in that event... Something else would've been used as the murder weapon. (Changed from [Something else must have been used as the murder weapon.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nHmm... Wait...! (Changed from [Well... Hmm...] in the original release) Then you mean this bust was the murder weapon... purely by accident!? (Changed from [Or maybe this bust was the murder weapon... But it was used by accident.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nIt's possible. (Changed from [That's possible.] in the original release) Maybe Acro saw Money's mountain of stolen goods and thought to use one of them.\nAcro:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAnyways... I think we've more than proven one critical fact. Namely, that it was entirely possible that Acro was the murderer!\nvon Karma:\nMORON!!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright's argument was so circular, I'm still a bit dizzy! However... His argument does hold water... There's no denying that. OWWW!!\nvon Karma:\nDon't seem so flamboozled! Especially by this fraud of an attorney!\nPhoenix:\nFraud...?\nvon Karma:\nYou've forgotten the absolute, most important thing, Mr. Phoenix Wright!!\nPhoenix:\nAnd what is that?\nvon Karma:\nYou should know!! You forgot that your fraud of a magical client was spotted at the scene of the crime!\nPhoenix:\nAHHHHH!!\nvon Karma:\nThere is no reason to doubt the clown's testimony!\nJudge:\nT-That's true! How do you respond to that, Mr. Wright!\nMaya:\nNick! Don't let her beat you now!\nPhoenix:\n(I won't! This is my chance to turn this trial around!)\nvon Karma:\nWhen the murder occurred, there were two people at the scene of the crime! One was the victim, Russell Berry, and the other was the murderer himself! Answer this and only this, Mr. Phoenix Wright! Who was the murderer the clown saw!? (Changed from [The clown saw the murderer! Who was it then!?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nHe saw Max's B-- OWWW!!\nvon Karma:\nI asked who was the other person Moe saw on the scene! That evidence has nothing to do with the question!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAu contraire, mon frére! It does indeed have something to do with the question!\nAcro:\n...\nPhoenix:\nMoe said that he saw Max's silhouette... But he did not actually see the man himself! It wasn't a human being he saw!\nJudge:\nH-H-How is that possible!?\nPhoenix:\nIt's simple, really. What Moe actually saw that night was Max's bust!\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nWhat are you talking about!? Have you tried using your brain at all in this case!? The silhouette he saw was wearing a cloak! (Changed from [The silhouette he saw just happened to be wearing a cloak!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThere's no reason why you couldn't attach a cloak to the bust! It would be easy to hang one off of the cards in the bust's hands! (Changed from [Or a cloak like that could easily get snagged on the bust if they came into contact.] in the original release)\nvon Karma:\nIdiot!! Who in their right mind would put a cloak on a bust!?\nPhoenix:\nIt doesn't matter who put it on the bust!\nJudge:\nJust wait a minute now, Mr. Wright! Who put the cloak on the bust? That question is of the utmost importance to this case, don't you agree!?\nPhoenix:\n(Doh! He caught me...)\nJudge:\nSo let's have it Mr. Wright... Who put the cloak on the bust?\nvon Karma:\nF-F-FOOL!! H-HIM...!?\nJudge:\nYou are saying it was the victim himself!? Russell Berry!?\nPhoenix:\nThat's what I'm saying!\nvon Karma:\nHe... I mean, the victim himself, placed the cloak on the bust!?\nPhoenix:\n\"Placed the cloak\" isn't really the right way of putting it...\nJudge:\nThen what would be the right way of putting it, Mr. Wright?\nvon Karma:\nExplain yourself!\nMaya:\nNick! Do you really have a handle on all of this?\nPhoenix:\nI'm fine, Maya. I'm finally putting all the pieces together... There's really only one picture I can paint, anyways. Alright... So you want to know what really happened that night? Let's step back in time. Acro used a rope to lower the wooden box onto the scene. Then he attached that rope to the bust, and dangled the bust out of his bedroom window, directly above the wooden box. At the same time, the Ringmaster told Max to wait in his room, and went to the scene. Of course, at the time, the Ringmaster was wearing Max's costume. Perhaps he didn't want anyone to recognize him that night. But just as he feared, he was spotted at the entrance of the lodging house. By none other than a ventriloquist and his puppet, Ben and Trilo. When the Ringmaster arrived at the scene, he bent over to lift the wooden box. And that's when Acro took his chance and released the rope! Now this is when the magic happens... At the very instant that the bust hit the victim...\nvon Karma:\nYou just wait a second there, Mr. Phoenix Wright!! As much as you try... As much as you scheme... This just isn't true! It can't be!\nPhoenix:\nIt's still a little early to be getting so upset, Ms. von Karma... This circus isn't over yet.\nvon Karma:\nWhat...? (Changed from [Eh...?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nThe impact of the bust on the victim threw the cloak up, which snagged onto the bust. (Changed from [With the shock of impact, it threw up the cloak and it got snagged onto the bust.] in the original release) That impact also caused the sound a certain witness heard, prompting him to take a look. (Changed from [That's when the sound was heard by a witness and he took a look out of his window.] in the original release) That witness was, of course, Lawrence \"Moe\" Curls, the clown. When Moe looked out his window, the cloak had already snagged onto the bust. Now... Having completed the crime, Acro naturally went about pulling up the murder weapon. Of course, he had no idea that Moe saw the bust being raised with the cloak dangling on it. Primarily because, in his wheelchair, he couldn't see out of his window. So he just kept pulling the bust up. And that is how the \"magical murderer disappearing into the sky\" came to be.\nvon Karma:\n...\nAcro:\n...\nJudge:\n...\n..................\nPhoenix:\nSo you see, the only person who could've pulled this off... (Changed from [Now you know how the murder actually took place...] in the original release) is the one person who was able to drop the murder weapon from above the crime scene! (Changed from [And now you know who was able to drop the murder weapon from above the scene!] in the original release) Acro! It could only have been you!\nAcro:\n...\nMaya:\nAcro's been playing mind games with all of us!\nPhoenix:\n(He sure has... But he has come to the end of his rope now.)\nvon Karma:\nSo...?\nPhoenix:\nWhat now!?\nvon Karma:\nYou've graced us with a rather long-winded tale... But do you have any evidence to prove that your fairy tale is true!?\nJudge:\n... E-Evidence...?\nvon Karma:\nIn this court, only two things matter. The power of evidence, and the power of my whip.\nJudge:\nDon't forget the power of my gavel as well! Mr. Wright, the prosecution brings up a good point. Can we see some evidence?\nMaya:\nNick... They say they want evidence...\nPhoenix:\nI just explained how there can only be one possible murder method. But there is still something unusual about Moe's eyewitness account.\nMaya:\n\"Unusual\"?\nPhoenix:\nA contradiction, actually.\nMaya:\nOK then! Use that and get out of this jam!\nJudge:\nThat's enough talking amongst yourselves. Proceed, Mr. Wright. Present some evidence to the court that backs your claims. I want hard proof that you have unraveled the trick to this magic case...!\nPhoenix:\nThe problem is Max's three symbols... You know... The silk hat, the cloak, and the white roses.\nJudge:\nThose symbols were a problem numerous times during yesterday's proceedings.\nPhoenix:\nYesterday, there were two contradictions in Moe's testimony.\nvon Karma:\nThe silk hat was one. The white roses were the other.\nPhoenix:\nBut the theory I just presented explains all of these contradictions!\nvon Karma:\nYou fool! Do you ever shut up!?\nPhoenix:\nMax's silk hat was found at the scene of the crime. However! Remember what Moe said yesterday. He testified that the criminal he saw fleeing the scene was wearing a silk hat! There's only one explanation for that! The \"silk hat\" that Moe saw was actually the bust's! (Changed from [The 'silk hat' that Moe saw was actually the bust!] in the original release)\nJudge:\nMakes sense... If you look at it that way, then he did see the silk hat, well, sort of.\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nFine, you've got one, but what about the other contradiction!?\nJudge:\nThe other contradiction...?\nvon Karma:\nRemember what that ventriloquist said in court! He said that he witnessed \"white roses\" on \"Max's\" chest that night! But the clown's testimony doesn't match! The clown said that there were no \"white roses\"! I'd like to see you try and explain that one away!!\nMaya:\nCan you do it, Nick!?\nPhoenix:\nOf course! I can explain all of it!\nvon Karma:\nWhat was that...!?\nPhoenix:\nPlease recall the instant when the cloak snagged onto the bust! If the cloak snagged onto the bust, what happened to the white roses? Do you get it yet? If the cloak got snagged onto the front of the bust... It means that the white roses would end up on the back of the bust!\nvon Karma:\nAHHHHH!!\nPhoenix:\nWhich explains why Moe didn't see them! (Changed from [Which explains why Moe didn't see it!] in the original release) The white roses were not visible because they were on the back side of the bust!\nJudge:\nOrder! Orderrrrrrrr!\nJudge:\n... This is quite the shocking state of affairs. Mr. Wright's theory still sounds a bit absurd to me. However... Let's just keep going down this road for a while and see where it leads!\nMaya:\nLet's do this, Nick! Then maybe Von Karma will finally throw in the towel...\nvon Karma:\n...\nAcro:\n...\nMaya:\nWell... So much for that theory.\nAcro:\nMr. Wright... Do you mind?\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it?\nAcro:\nYou took the time to research our circus, didn't you?\nPhoenix:\nWell... Yes, I did... Is there something making you think that I didn't?\nAcro:\nIf you did, then maybe you'll understand why I think you're off track.\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Why is that?\nvon Karma:\nMotive. This witness feels an incredible debt of gratitude towards the Ringmaster. Anyone with any relation to the circus is well aware of this.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nvon Karma:\nThus, there is absolutely no way someone like this would kill the Ringmaster!\nJudge:\nHmm...\nvon Karma:\nYour Honor, I'd like you to hear Acro's story! Learn about his relationship with the Ringmaster, and his life up until now...\nMaya:\nW-What do we do!? There's no doubting that Acro deeply respected the Ringmaster!\nPhoenix:\n(Acro's motive... Hmm...)\nJudge:\nIt seems that this case isn't over yet... Very well. However, I feel this is a good place to take a break. I will listen to the rest of Mr. Dingling's testimony after recess.\nAcro:\n...\nJudge:\nThis court will now take a 10 minute recess.\nTo be continued.\nDecember 30, 2:17 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 5\nMax:\nI can't believe it!! Acro!?\nPhoenix:\nIt's pretty shocking, isn't it?\nMax:\nIt definitely is! And to think he was always the most straight-forward of the group. Geebus... Am I THAT hated!? (Changed from [Geebus... Unbelievable...] in the original release)\n*Ahem!*\nMaya:\nAcro tried to pin the murder on you on purpose...\nMax:\nHe... He did?\n*Psst!* *Psst!* *Cough!*\nMax:\nBut, but...

This guy deserves to be guilty anyways...\nPhoenix:\nNow, now, Detective. I'm sorry. Look, why don't you relax a little. (Changed from [Now, now, Detective. I'm sorry. Now, why don't you relax a little.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nWe've got some really tasty milk!\nMax:\nHow about a card trick, Detective?\nGumshoe:\n... Ho ho ho... Well, if you insist...\nMaya:\nNow about that evidence you mentioned... What is it!?\nGumshoe:\nHere ya go.\nMaya:\nHuh? This was... Yesterday in Acro's room...\nGumshoe:\nYup! And I've included the forensic results... Take a look at it later. (Changed from [The result of our investigation... You can look at it later.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nWon't Ms. von Karma be mad that you're doing this? (Changed from [Won't Von Karma be mad that you're doing this?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\n... That's why this is all a secret.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nLook, details are on a need to know basis. And we're not really allies or anything... But everything that's happened in court up until now has gone according to our plan.\nMaya:\nI don't know... Ms. von Karma didn't seem in control of things in there just now...

Yesterday, our final plans were set into motion. (Changed from [Yesterday, our final plans were put into place.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n\"Final plans\"...?\nGumshoe:\nUh huh. That reminds me... I've got a message from the prosecutor for you. \"Nothing is ever truly decided until the very end.\" (Changed from ['Judgment comes at the very last instant.'] in the original release) That's it.

Everything he said seemed pretty cryptic to me...] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nOh... One more thing.\nMaya:\nAhhh! Don't scare me like that!\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like there's a large care package from the circus for the defendant.\nMax:\nWhat? For me...? (Changed from [Eh? For me...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nIt's milk. The reception area looks like some kind of dairy, so hurry up and drink it all before it spoils.

For me!?\nDecember 30, 2:27 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2\nJudge:\nCourt is now back in session. (Changed from [This court is now in session. Shall we continue our proceedings?] in the original release) Ms. von Karma. Please continue from where you left off.\nvon Karma:\nI'd like to continue with Acro's testimony, starting with his relationship to the victim. I'd also like to get proof from the defense... Proof of what kind of motive Acro would have to commit this crime.\nJudge:\nUnderstood. Now, Mr. Dingling.\nAcro:\nYes, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nPlease proceed with your testimony.\nMaya:\nFinally we get to the motive! Wait... Nick, are you OK?\nPhoenix:\nJust do me a favor and don't ask questions you don't want the answer to...\nMaya:\n... *gulp*\nWitness Testimony\n-- About the Ringmaster --\nAcro:\nWhen we were little, we were abandoned by our parents.\nThat's when the Ringmaster of the Berry Big Circus, Russell Berry, took us in.\nI became an acrobat at around nine years old.\nI wanted to find a way to repay the Ringmaster. That was my sole purpose in life...\nJudge:\nHmm... You're such a thoughtful young man.\nvon Karma:\nAs you heard, the witness deeply respected the victim. I wonder how anyone could think that Acro could kill the man he held in such esteem.\nJudge:\nYou are absolutely right... How could anyone think that, Mr. Wright? Which is why there's no real need for a cross-examination, is there?\nPhoenix:\n(Actually, that's the question I'm trying to answer myself... \"Why would Acro kill the Ringmaster?\"... This might be my last chance to answer that question.)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright... I'd like to ask you a question.\nPhoenix:\nGo ahead, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nI would just like to know: (Changed from [What was Acro's motive for killing the Ringmaster?] in the original release) can you provide an explanation as to why Acro would want the Ringmaster dead? (Changed from [How about it? Can you explain that to me?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nNick...?\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah... I didn't even have to think about it... It was obvious from the start!) Your Honor. The reason that Acro killed the Ringmaster is something that can't be proven.\nJudge:\nW-What!?\nPhoenix:\nThat's because Acro had no reason to kill the Ringmaster at all. OWWW!!\nvon Karma:\nYour foolish attempts to fool us like foolish fools is so fool-heartedly foolish! Did you forget!? You made an accusation against this witness, did you not? I believe it was... \"This is the real killer of Russell Berry, Ringmaster.\"\nPhoenix:\nIf you want to jump to the end of things... Then, yes, that sounds about right.\nJudge:\nThe end of things...?\nPhoenix:\nAcro. You didn't plan to kill the Ringmaster at all, did you? The Ringmaster wasn't your target that night.\nvon Karma:\nWhat did you just say!?\nPhoenix:\nI'm saying that the target of this witness's murderous plot was not the Ringmaster. (Changed from [I'm saying that the target of this witness's murder plot was not the Ringmaster.] in the original release) Because it was never his intention to kill Russell Berry to begin with! (Changed from [He did not plan to kill Russell Berry!] in the original release)\nvon Karma:\nW-WHAAATT?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Bailiff, I don't care who it is, smack anyone who's loud in the face! Twice if you must! Mr. Wright! What in the world are you trying to do to my court!? OWWW!!\nvon Karma:\nMr. Phoenix Wright! What in the world are you trying to do to his court!? Are you attempting to imply that Acro was trying to kill someone else!?\nvon Karma:\nRegina Berry...?\nJudge:\nThis young girl is the Ringmaster's daughter, correct?\nPhoenix:\nAcro. You were really aiming for her that night, weren't you?\nAcro:\n...\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nYou don't need to answer that! It's a mean-spirited leading question!!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHe could easily answer this question! If I'm wrong, all he has to say is, \"You're wrong.\" That's it.\nvon Karma:\nThat's it, huh Mr. Phoenix Wright?\nJudge:\nEnough! Mr. Wright, allow me to-- OWWW!!\nvon Karma:\nThe only thing allowed to interrupt me is death itself!\nJudge:\nHuh!?\nvon Karma:\nAnd that goes for you, too... Mr. Phoenix Wright! Show me evidence! Now! I want to know why Acro would want to kill Regina Berry!\nPhoenix:\n...!!\nJudge:\nY-Y-Yes! Me too! I demand to see some proof! Present evidence that proves Acro was out to kill this young girl!\nPhoenix:\nAcro... You remember this, don't you? (Changed from [Acro... Do you have any recollection of seeing this?] in the original release)\nAcro:\nThat's...\nPhoenix:\nIt's a piece of paper that we found inside the Ringmaster's tailcoat.\nJudge:\nInside the victim's tailcoat?\nPhoenix:\nAcro wrote this note. It's ironically entitled \"To the Murderer!\"... Its purpose was to call someone to the plaza at 10:00 PM. (Changed from [It's [sic] purpose was to call someone to the plaza at 10:00 PM.] in the original release)\nJudge:\nSo you're saying that he called Russell Berry with that note...!?\nPhoenix:\nYes, but there's just one little problem... (Changed from [There's just one little problem...] in the original release)\nJudge:\nProblem?\nPhoenix:\nAcro did indeed place this note into someone's pocket. However, that someone was not the Ringmaster!\nvon Karma:\nYou mean... It wasn't for the...\nPhoenix:\nThat's exactly what I mean. The person this note was intended for was none other than... Regina Berry! (Ellpsis not present in the original release)\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order! M-Mr. Wright! This little theory of yours...\nPhoenix:\nIt's the truth, Your Honor. It isn't a theory. Simply put, Regina didn't think the note was meant for her. Which is why, the morning of the crime, she placed it on the cafeteria bulletin board.\nvon Karma:\nThat's when her father... I mean the Ringmaster... saw the note? (Changed from [That's when her father... I mean the Ringmaster... Read the note?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nThat's correct. The Ringmaster ended up in that plaza instead of Regina! And he was killed because of that mistake... Instead of Regina!!\nJudge:\nThat's... That's... That's incredible!\nPhoenix:\nRemember the testimony that Acro gave us earlier today!\nAcro:\nLifting the bust and looking out of the window would've been impossible. There's no way I could have exerted that kind of force on my lower body. If I were to do that, I'd end up falling out the window myself.\nPhoenix:\nAcro had no idea who it was that arrived in the plaza... Because he couldn't look down out of his window to see who it actually was.\nJudge:\nI've got it! I've got it! Acro thought it was Regina down in the plaza...\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when he let the bust fly.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick... Isn't Regina listening to all of this from the audience?\nPhoenix:\nShe is. Unfortunately, it's only going to get harsher from here.\nMaya:\nI hope Regina can handle it...\nJudge:\nAcro wrote this note to Regina...!\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nFoolishly foolish fool with foolishly foolish fool ideas of foolish tomfoolery... ... You're so foolish, you've even made me sound like a foolhardy fool... Very well, Mr. Phoenix Wright. If you're so sure, then tell us about this line! \"I have conclusive evidence of what took place.\"\nPhoenix:\nYes? What about that line? (Changed from [Uh huh. That's a line in the note alright.] in the original release)\nvon Karma:\nWell, if the note was meant for Regina Berry, it would mean that... (Changed from [Well, then if the note was sent to Regina Berry, it must mean that...] in the original release) this note is declaring that Regina Berry is a murderer!\nPhoenix:\nYou just don't get it, do you?\nvon Karma:\nWhat!? ... What did you just say!?\nPhoenix:\nThe Ringmaster knew what the note meant! Which is why he went to the plaza. ...In place of his lovely daughter!\nJudge:\nH-Hold it right there, Mr. Wright! What is this incident that is alluded to in the note?\nPhoenix:\n(The incident six months ago...)\nPhoenix:\nAn incident occurred six months ago... And now I am more than ready to show this court what happened at that time!\nvon Karma:\n...Moron!\nJudge:\nWait! Are you sure that it relates to the present case!?\nPhoenix:\nIt does indeed, Your Honor! Everything in this case has its start in what happened six months ago!\nMaya:\nReally, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI... Umm... I think so.\nvon Karma:\nWell then, if that's the case, hurry up and tell us about it. What is this \"conclusive evidence\" mentioned in the note? I know I'd certainly like to know what it is!\nPhoenix:\n(If I can't answer that question, the judge is going to think I'm bluffing!) The \"conclusive evidence\" about the incident six months ago is actually...\nJudge:\n... Hmm... ... *Achoo!* *Achoo!* *Achoo!* *Achoo!* *Achoo!* *Achoo!*\nvon Karma:\nWhat kind of spicy joke is this... Mr. Phoenix Wright?\nPhoenix:\nIt isn't a joke at all. It's the decisive evidence you asked for.\nJudge:\nW-W-What do you mean?\nPhoenix:\nRecall that the victim was trying to take the wooden box away with him. (Changed from [The victim would arrive and try to take away the wooden box.] in the original release) He was doing so because this piece of decisive evidence is what was inside! (Changed from [That's when they'd discover the decisive evidence found inside!] in the original release)\nJudge:\nAnother unbelievable conclusion! Very well, Mr. Wright. So what exactly are you saying? Are you claiming Regina Berry killed someone with a small bottle of pepper!?\nPhoenix:\nTaking the note into account, that's the only logical conclusion you can draw...\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\n...Foolish fool who never tires of his own foolish ways... If you're so sure, Mr. Phoenix Wright, then answer this question! Who was Regina Berry's intended victim?\nJudge:\nWho is this...?\nPhoenix:\nThat is Acro's younger brother.\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nWhat does this prove? His younger brother isn't dead!!\nPhoenix:\nTechnically, that's true. However, Bat has been in a coma for six months now... It's not a stretch to see how Acro could feel that his brother is dead!\nJudge:\nRegina... She did that to him...?\nvon Karma:\nDo you spend your entire life dreaming up new ways to be a fool!? Naturally, the prosecution has looked into Acro's brother, Sean Dingling. Six months ago, he was bit by a lion and fell into his current comatose state!\nJudge:\nA l-l-lion!?\nvon Karma:\nRegina... I mean, Ms. Regina Berry is an animal tamer by trade. However, no tamed animal in that position is ever trained to attack another human! They wouldn't understand the command! Moreover, Ms. Regina could never do something like that! It's just not in her.\nJudge:\nHmm... So then what happened to Acro's brother?\nvon Karma:\nHe's not the victim of an attempted murder, he's the victim of an accident.\nJudge:\nI see...\nMaya:\nNow what do we do? No one seems to be going along with your theory. Do you think what happened to Bat was actually an accident!?\nPhoenix:\nThe lion biting Bat was no accident at all!\nJudge:\nW-WHAT!?\nvon Karma:\nYou're such an amateur, Mr. Phoenix Wright! There is no way that Regina would ever incite her lion to attack another human being!\nPhoenix:\nShe may not have incited the lion to attack another human being, but Regina is responsible for making the lion bite Acro's brother, Bat!\nJudge:\nThat's... That's just a scarf.\nPhoenix:\nAcro.\nAcro:\n...\nPhoenix:\nThis scarf is something that Bat used to wear, correct?\nAcro:\nThat's right...\nPhoenix:\nAnd who is the one that gave this scarf to Bat?\nAcro:\nR... Regina... Regina gave it to him...\nJudge:\nRegina...\nPhoenix:\nThere is something more than just blood on this scarf, Your Honor.\nJudge:\n...And what might that be?\nPhoenix:\nPepper.\nJudge:\nPepper?\nPhoenix:\nPepper. Regina gave this scarf to Bat right before the accident! And she covered it with as much pepper as she could!\nvon Karma:\n...\nAcro:\n...\nJudge:\n...\n..................\nPhoenix:\n(Hey... What's with the silent treatment?)\nJudge:\nUmm... Excuse me, Mr. Wright. You've done a good job of fingering a criminal... But out of curiosity... What was her crime?\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nJudge:\nMs. Berry gave a pepper-covered scarf to Bat as a present. (Changed from [Regina gave a pepper covered scarf to Bat as a present.] in the original release) Where's the crime in that?\nPhoenix:\n(It still seems like the judge just doesn't get it...)\nvon Karma:\n... Mr. Phoenix Wright... Wasn't it said that the lion seemed to be smiling?\nAcro:\n!\nJudge:\nSmiling? The lion was smiling?\nvon Karma:\nRight before Bat was bit by the lion. For a moment, the lion's mouth changed and it looked like he was... smiling.\nJudge:\nLions... smile?\nvon Karma:\nI've never heard of them smiling; however...\nPhoenix:\nLions sneeze.\nJudge:\nW-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W...\nPhoenix:\nLéon didn't plan on biting Bat at all. ...In reality, all he actually did was sneeze. He sneezed because of all the pepper on the scarf! (Changed from [He sneezed because of all the pepper spread on the scarf!] in the original release)\nJudge:\nW-W-W-W-WHAT!?!?\nvon Karma:\nYOU FOOOOOOL!!\nJudge:\n.................. You've got to be kidding me!!\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\n..............................\nJudge:\nW-What's the matter, Ms. von Karma?\nvon Karma:\nI... I... I object... For objection's sake... Mr. Phoenix Wright! You... This theory... You believe it? You really intend to say that this joke of an accident actually happened? (Changed from [You really plan to say this joke of an accident actually happened?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nOf course I do! It's the truth. The lion sneezed due to the pepper, and that's when Bat... lost consciousness. Acro nearly lost his brother due to this accident! Or this \"joke\", as you put it. Which is why he tried to get his revenge... against Regina.\nvon Karma:\nYou foolish idiot!\nAcro:\nHa... (Changed from [Hmm...] in the original release) Ha ha ha... It almost does seem like a terrible joke... doesn't it...? (Changed from [So it's a 'joke of an accident' to you huh?] in the original release) ... Once again, I'm impressed by your imagination, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nAcro:\nTo think that there's someone who treats this accident with the respect it deserves...\nPhoenix:\nAre you telling me that what I said was... true?\nAcro:\n...\nMaya:\nA-Acro...\nvon Karma:\n...You don't mean!? You can't mean!? Witness...!?\nJudge:\nA-Are you confirming the defense's claim...!?\nAcro:\n... Mr. Wright. Unfortunately, your imagination is not enough to find me guilty of murder.\nPhoenix:\n... What do you mean by that?\nAcro:\nThe pepper... The scarf... The lion... ...I see where you're going, but it's a bit hard to swallow... Not to mention the fact that there's an even bigger problem with your theory.\nJudge:\nWhat would that problem be?\nAcro:\nThe same problem it's always been... Evidence. If I dropped Max's bust on top of the Ringmaster... Where is the evidence that proves that claim?\nPhoenix:\nUhhh...\nJudge:\nHmm... You mean the \"conclusive evidence\"?\nvon Karma:\nThe biggest problem is the murder weapon, or the lack thereof to be more precise.\nPhoenix:\nThe murder weapon... (Changed from [Murder weapon...] in the original release)\nJudge:\nThe \"bust\" that the defense claims was used... If that were to be found in Acro's room, and if it was covered with the victim's blood, that would be awfully conclusive in my eyes.\nvon Karma:\nYes, it would be...\nPhoenix:\n(The \"bust\"...)\nMaya:\nNick! You've gotta do something...!\nPhoenix:\n(This is the last step... If I get this one right, the case is won!)\nvon Karma:\nA Von Karma never leaves anything to chance! We already searched Acro's room yesterday!\nJudge:\nW-What did you find!?\nvon Karma:\nThere's no reason to even say it. If we found what you think we found in that room, Acro would not be here as a witness. But to put a point on it, Max's bust was not in the room! The murder weapon is still unaccounted for.\nAcro:\nYou see, Mr. Wright. The bust wasn't in my room.\nvon Karma:\nFurthermore, Detective Dick Gumshoe executed the search by complete surprise. And we took Acro directly to the prosecutor's office after that. End of story...\nPhoenix:\n(J-Just wait a second... Something's funny about all this...)\nAcro:\nHa ha ha ha... (Changed from [Heh heh heh heh...] in the original release) It looks like you lack the final nail to put into my coffin. (Changed from [It looks like the coup d'grace in this case was ever so sweet...] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nBut... But... What about the scarf!? What about the note!?\nAcro:\nWhat about them, Mr. Wright? No offense, but the only evidence that is relevant here (Changed from [What about them? Mr. Wright, no offense, but the important evidence here] in the original release) is that which pertains to the death of the Ringmaster. You should know that by now. (Changed from [is about the death of the Ringmaster. I think you should remember that.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nArrggh!\nMaya:\nDo something, Nick! Don't let this case slip away!! The bust... Where is it now?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Where's the bust right now?)\nMaya:\nYou're Phoenix Wright! You know where that bust is! I'm sure you do!\nPhoenix:\n(There's not even a single clue... How am I supposed to know where the bust is!?)\nJudge:\nIt seems this case is coming to a close... (Changed from [It seems as if this case is coming to a close...] in the original release) The defense's counter-arguments look to have fallen short.\nvon Karma:\nThank you for your support...\nPhoenix:\n...Ack!\nAcro:\nI'm terribly sorry, Mr. Wright... (Changed from [Now if you'll please excuse me, Mr. Wright.] in the original release)\nJudge:\nI think that brings to an end the cross-examination of this witness!\n???:\nMaya:\nWhere is Max's bust...? The defense needs time to prepare to present its lace... (Changed from [The defense needs time to prepare to present it's [sic] lace...] in the original release) I mean case. Sorry, I'm a bit nervous and I just bit my tongue.\nJudge:\nHuh?\nvon Karma:\nWhat?\nPhoenix:\nWe need time to do WHAT!?!? OWWW!!\nvon Karma:\nWhy are you the most surprised person here!? She's YOUR aide, isn't she!?\nJudge:\nD-Do you really have a-a case to present, Mr. Wright!?\nPhoenix:\nW-Whaaa--!? Are you asking ME!? (Changed form [W-Whaaa!? Is he talking to me!?] in the original release)\nMaya:\nThe rest is up to you, Nick! Good luck!\nPhoenix:\nH-Hey... Wait... You can't be serious...\nMaya:\nAcrobats always have their lives on the lines, don't they? (Changed from [Acrobat's [sic] always have their lives on the lines, don't they?] in the original release) That's how Acro's lived his life up until now. Now it's time for us to walk across our own tightrope! If we don't, we're certain to lose!\nJudge:\nVery well... The defense may proceed.\nAcro:\nHe doesn't have a clue...  And I don't think he'll be finding one anytime soon.\nPhoenix:\n(...Walking the tightrope of logic... There's no room for a false step! Sink or swim... The only way through is forward!)\nvon Karma:\nThe murder weapon... Where is Max's bust now!?\nPhoenix:\nAcro... I'm sorry to ask this, but do you mind if I take the blanket off your wheelchair?\nAcro:\n... I'm sorry, I didn't quite hear you, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nWell... You are a big guy... And you have a pretty big wheelchair because of it... I just wanted to make sure you weren't hiding anything under that blanket. Because it seems to me that it'd be really easy to say... hide a bust under there...\nAcro:\n...Hah hah hah hah hah... Once again, your penchant for humor hits me where it hurts, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nI think it's pretty amazing that you could laugh in your position... However, your lightheartedness doesn't change the fact that the bust is under there.\nAcro:\n...\nPhoenix:\nWe all know that you couldn't leave the lodging house by yourself in your condition. That proved inconvenient when Ms. von Karma happened to search your room yesterday. If she had found the murder weapon in your room, it would have been all over. Which is why you had to hide it. In the only place that you could hide it... Under your wheelchair.\nAcro:\n...\nPhoenix:\nWhich is why, Acro, I have to ask you again. Would you please remove the blanket from your lap? (Changed from [Could you please remove the blanket from the wheelchair?] in the original release)\nAcro:\n... Well done, Mr. Wright. Masterfully played.\nvon Karma:\n...You!! You fool! How could you...!?\nAcro:\nYou've got me. I've been bagged by a real pro. Actually, two of them...\nPhoenix:\n(Two of them...?)\nAcro:\nMs. Franziska von Karma and Mr. Phoenix Wright.\nvon Karma:\n...What!?\nAcro:\nThere's just one think I'd like to know... How did you know to launch the surprise search on my room last night?\nvon Karma:\n...?\nAcro:\nThere were two decisive pieces of evidence... The cloak and the bust... I burned the cloak in my room and threw the ashes away with the trash. ...Regina always took my trash out every morning, you know. But the bust... Obviously I couldn't throw that away. When you executed your search, all I could do was try and hide the bust. And the only place that I could hide it quickly was under this wheelchair... Ms. von Karma, you had things all figured out, didn't you? I was completely sucked in by your calculated strategy... And now to be caught in the middle of court hiding the murder weapon... ...There's no way I can escape that. So you've got me. Well done, Mr. Wright. Well done, Ms. von Karma.\nJudge:\nHmm... It all makes sense now.\nMaya:\nI can't believe that Von Karma thought that far ahead... It's amazing!\nPhoenix:\nUh huh... You definitely couldn't tell by looking at her. I know I sure couldn't.\nvon Karma:\n...I can't believe it... Me...! Make a mistake! (Changed from [...I can't believe it... I... Failed!] in the original release) Why did I order a surprise search of your room... If only I hadn't done that...\nJudge:\nIt seems we've arrived at the truth. (Changed from [It doesn't matter now though. It seems as if we've arrived at the truth.] in the original release) Acro.\nAcro:\nYes, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nDid you kill the Ringmaster of the Berry Big Circus, Mr. Russell Berry?\nAcro:\nYes, Your Honor. I'm responsible for that crime.\nMaya:\nAcro...\nAcro:\n... All my brother wanted... was for Regina to like him. That's why he'd tease her. (Changed from [All my brother did... was want Regina to like him. That's why he'd tease her.] in the original release) One day, my brother sprinkled some pepper on Regina. She started sneezing so hard... You couldn't help yourself from laughing. That's why Regina thought it'd be funny to get him back in the same way...\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's why she covered the scarf in pepper...\nAcro:\nI know she didn't mean for anything bad to happen... I know this... (Changed from [I know she didn't want anything bad to happen... I know this...] in the original release) She just wanted to make my brother sneeze a few times, too... But... I just couldn't forgive her! No matter what. What am I truly guilty of? ...I'm guilty of never, ever being able to understand her. \"Your brother became a star.\" Regina believed in that so purely... that she would laugh innocently when saying it... Too innocently... I just couldn't stand it... No matter how hard I tried.\nPhoenix:\nThat's when you decided to do something about Regina...\nvon Karma:\nHow... dreadful... (Changed from [What do you mean by that...?] in the original release)\nJudge:\nSo are you saying that you are a victim in all of this as well?\nAcro:\nNo... That's not what I mean. I'm nothing but a murderer. That's who I am... At first, I thought I'd kill myself. Then I pondered giving myself up... But... I couldn't just up and leave... I just couldn't... Not yet... (Changed from [But... I couldn't just up and leave... I just couldn't...] in the original release) That's why... I tried... to pin this... on Max. Max... I'm so sorry...! I just... I just... I just couldn't up and leave yet...\nJudge:\nThis has been such a strange case... It's almost a reflection of the circus itself.\nvon Karma:\nI'm... An... Idiot... I can't believe it... You... Beat me... Again.\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\nI believe this case is now beyond any point of possible discussion. Thus, I'd like to declare my verdict.\nNot Guilty\nJudge:\nThis court is adjourned.\nDecember 30, 4:27 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 5\nMax:\nF-F-F-FABULOUS!! But to be honest, I can't really be too happy about this.\nMaya:\nAcro, the Ringmaster, Regina, and Bat... Not a single one of them was a bad person inside, huh?\nMax:\nThat's a good question. And one I don't know the answer to.\nMoe:\nMany congrats! But only, at max, a million of them! (Changed from [Congratulations! Congratulations Mr. Max!] in the original release)\nMax:\nT-Thank you. ...\nMaya:\n...\nMoe:\nWhat's with the vibe in this room?\nMaya:\nWe're just thinking about Acro...\nMoe:\nNo no no no no! If you worry about people too much, then you'll be like this forever, and never be happy!\nMaya:\nHuh?\nRegina:\nWAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!\nMoe:\n...She's been like this for a while now.\nRegina:\nWAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!! IT'S ALL MY FAULTTTTTT!! WAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!\nMax:\nS-S-Sweetie... Sweetie pie...\nRegina:\nBat and Acro... They're never coming back!! Now... Now everyone's gonna split up!!\nMaya:\nRegina...\nRegina:\nMr. Wright! Tell me something!\nPhoenix:\nW-What do you want to know, Regina?\nRegina:\nAcro said something right at the end...\n...I just couldn't up and leave yet...\nRegina:\n...Does that mean Acro... Is he gonna try and get his revenge on me!?\nMoe:\nHey, Max.\nMax:\nWhat is it, Moe?\nMoe:\nWe really put you through a lot, didn't we buddy? I'm sorry about what happened. So whenever you'd like to leave us, I'll pay your fee and rip up the contract.\nMax:\nI understand! What a fabulous thing to do for me... I might even leave tomorrow. (Changed from [I understand! Such a fabulous thing to do for me... I might even leave tomorrow.] in the original release) ... What's going to happen to the circus now?\nMoe:\nAhh... That's the big question. Our Ringmaster was really an amazing person, wasn't he?\nMax:\n...?\nMoe:\nEven though he's not here anymore, everyone is sticking together. The staff, the performers... No one wants to leave the circus. That's why I've made a decision...\nMax:\nWhat is it?\nMoe:\nI've decided that I will take over as the new Ringmaster. I'll turn this circus into the best circus this world has ever seen!\nMax:\n... The best circus the world has ever seen!?\nMoe:\nD-D-Don't laugh!\nPhoenix:\nThat's quite the goal... (Changed from [Amazing...] in the original release)\nMaya:\nYay! I can't wait!!\nMax:\nThen I guess that changes things...\nMoe:\nHuh?\nMax:\nThere's only one thing the best circus in the world has ever seen needs. The world's best illusions... Which means this circus needs the best magician the world has ever seen!\nMoe:\nMax...\nMax:\nLet's work together and make our circus SUPER FABULOUS! Whaddya say, big guy?\nMoe:\nI don't know what to say... All I can say is thank you.\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Regina, you're gonna help them out too, aren't you?\nRegina:\nUmm... I don't know. Maybe the circus would be better off without me. (Changed from [Umm... I don't know. Maybe the circus would be better of [sic] without me.] in the original release)\nMoe:\nWhat are you talking about, Regina? Why do you think that I brought you to court today?\nRegina:\nUhh...\nMoe:\nWe've got to work together to make the Berry Big Circus bigger than it's ever been!\nRegina:\nM-Moe...\nMax:\nMoe's right, sweetie pie! It can't be the Berry Big Circus without Regina Berry!\nRegina:\nM-Max...\nMaya:\nNick!\nPhoenix:\nIt seems like everything is going to turn out alright here...\nMaya:\nI can't wait to go see the best circus the world has ever seen!\nMax:\nWe'll save you the most fabulous seats!\nMoe:\nIt'll take us a while to get ready, but I'm going to order special whoopee cushion seats!

You had it all figured out, didn't you? (Changed from [Umm... You had it all figured out yesterday, didn't you?] in the original release)\nIt was just a theory...

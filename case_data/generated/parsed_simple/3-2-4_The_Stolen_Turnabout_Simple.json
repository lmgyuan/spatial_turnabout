You can clean the toilet later! This is important!\nPhoenix:\n*sigh* What are you freaking out about now?\nMaya:\nHey hee. Today will be the last time you talk to me that way!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMaya:\nWe're about to hit the big time!\nPhoenix:\n\"Big time\"? And what do you mean by \"we\"? You don't mean you and me are...?\nMaya:\nHa! Don't be silly. I'm talking about me and Pearly, of course!\nPearl:\nHello. It's a pleasure to see you again, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nPearls! You haven't changed a bit! Wait... What are you doing here anyway?\nPearl:\nHee hee. Haven't you heard, Mr. Nick? Here! Take a look at this!\nPhoenix:\n(What's this...? Some kind of poster?) Kurain Village... Isn't that...?\nMaya:\nThat's right. It's our hometown... Pearly and mine, that is.\nPhoenix:\nWhat's this about \"treasures\" from the boonies?\nMaya:\nHa ha ha. Very funny. You can laugh all you want... But you'll be singing another tune tonight!\nPhoenix:\nTonight? What about tonight?\nPearl:\nThe \"Treasures of Kurain\" exhibit doesn't actually start until next week, but... ...the promoter sent us some special VIP entry passes!\nMaya:\nThat's why I dressed up extra special today! What do you think, Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Heh. Same Maya. Different day.) This young lady here is Maya Fey... The younger sister of Mia Fey... ...My friend and mentor. I first met her two years ago... I was working on the case surrounding Mia's death, and ever since then...\nMaya:\nI've been the one who's been keeping this law office afloat from behind the scenes.\nPhoenix:\nActually that's just a cover for her true identity... In reality, she's a spirit medium, and a bit of a shady character.\nMaya:\nHey! Who are you calling \"shady\"!?\nPhoenix:\nAnd this little girl is Pearl Fey, but I usually call her \"Pearls\". She's Maya's cousin and a spirit medium in training herself.\nPearl:\nI know I'm a bit young, but I want to help in any way I can, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nKurain Village is the home of the mysterious Kurain Channelling Technique. And Maya here is the daughter of the Kurain School of Channeling's Master. ...I know it sounds ridiculous, but it's no joke. I've seen her power with my own eyes... It's the real thing alright.\nMaya:\nEarth to Nick! How long are you going to make two gorgeous women like us wait!?\nPearl:\nYes, Mr. Nick! I can't wait any longer! I want to see the exhibit!\nPhoenix:\n(*sigh* Looks like I don't get a choice here.

The city's fanciest and most expensive department store. Treasure Exhibit, huh... I have to admit I'm pretty impressed.)\nMaya: \nWow... This is awesome!\nPhoenix: \nYeah... You can make even the cheapest junk look great... It all depends on how you display it.\nPearl: \nOh! They even have the dusty old hanging scroll that was in the Fey Manor storeroom!\nMaya:  \nOh yeah, I remember scribbling on it when I was a little girl!\nPhoenix:\n(On a family heirloom...!?)\nMaya:  \nSay, Nick... The person in charge of this exhibition is waiting for us in the basement warehouse.\nPhoenix:  \nAlright...

I feel like a monster could jump out at any time...\nMaya:\nDon't be scared, Pearly! I'll protect you!\n???:\n...Oh... ...Mr. Wright.\nMaya:\nEeeeeeeek!! A monster! You were right!\nPhoenix: \n(Huh? A monster...?)\n???: \nGood evening. ...It's good to see you again.\nPhoenix: \nY-You... I know you...\n???: \nHa ha. Nice to see you again too, little miss.\nPearl: \nAh! H-Hello!\nMaya: \nIs she a friend of yours, Nick? ...And how do you know her, Pearly?\nAndrews: \nNice to meet you. I'm Adrian Andrews. I'm in charge of the promotion and planning for this Treasure Exhibit. I'm also responsible for the security arrangements.\nMaya: \nOh, um... N-Nice to meet you.\nPhoenix: \n(Adrian sure has changed since we last met...)\nAndrews: \nSo this is the warehouse.

Have you all eaten yet?\nPhoenix: \nUm, well actually...\nAndrews: \nI've already made a reservation at the restaurant on the 12th floor. Why don't we all dine together?\nMaya: \nOoh! I like the sound of that! \"Dine\"... It sounds so fancy!\nPearl: \nI'll have the \"Kid's Lunch\"!\nMaya: \nHa ha ha. Pearly, it's dinner, not lunch. Why don't you go for it and really eat your fill with a \"Kid's Dinner\"?\nPearl: \nOK! In that case, one \"Kid's Dinner\" for me!\nAndrews: \nHa ha. Shall we head upstairs, then?\nPhoenix: \nAfter that pleasant evening, all that remained was to wait for the exhibition's opening. It was wonderful seeing Ms. Andrews looking so happy. None of us could have imagined... ...that the very next day, something terrible would happen...\nOctober 12, 10:09 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nMaya: \nN-Nick! This is terrible! ...What the--!? You're cleaning the toilet again!? I never knew you were such a toilet freak!\nPhoenix:  \nGimme a break, would you? My brain just hit the snooze button for the fifth time...\nPearl: \nUm... I'm going to turn on the TV!\nAnnouncer:  \n...We've got an update on the recent treasure heist! Based on clues found at the scene of the crime, authorities have announced... that they believe it was the work of the renowned phantom thief, Mask☆DeMasque!\nPhoenix:  \n...M-Masque the Mask...?\nAnnouncer:  \nAccording to a spokesperson, Lordly Tailor received a threat letter some days ago. This is the fifth heist by the phantom thief, who only targets rare treasures.\nPhoenix:  \nL-Lordly Tailor...!?\nMaya:  \nWell, Nick!? What are you going to do!? Don't you dare go back to scrubbing the toilet!\nPhoenix:  \nTreasure...? Lordly Tailor...? You don't think...!?\nMaya:  \nYes! Now, get up, Nick! It was stolen! By Mask☆DeMasque! Our most valuable treasure... The Kurain Sacred Urn was STOLEN!!\nPhoenix:  \nWhaaat!?\nOctober 12Lordly TailorMain Exhibition Hall\nPearl: \nRight! Let's see if we can find some clues that might lead us to the bad guy!\nPhoenix: \n...But it doesn't look like anything has been disturbed.\nMaya: \nYeah, it looks pretty much the same as it did last night.\nPearl: \nHmmm... Bad guy, huh.\n???: \nHey! You can't poke around here, pal!\nPhoenix: \nWait a minute... that voice. Oh no! Not him again!\n???: \nIt's YOU!! And I'm the one who should be saying \"not again\"! Why is it that every time something bad happens, you always show up, pal?\nPhoenix: \nI should be asking you that. Aren't there any other detectives?\n???: \nNo, I should be asking YOU that. What are you doing hanging around here?\nPhoenix: \nHey, I asked you first. Why are you here any--\nMaya: \nAlright, alright, we got it! Why don't you two kiss and make up already?\nPearl: \n...Um, hello. It's been a long time, Mr. Scruffy Detective!\n???: \nOh! It's you, little missy! ...Um, ahh...\nGumshoe:\nActually, my name is Gumshoe. \"Detective Dick Gumshoe\"! Now is a good chance for you to try to remember it right!\nMaya: \nAnd if it's too long for you, you can just call him \"Dick\".\nPearl: \nOkay! It's good to see you again, Mr. Detective Dick!\nGumshoe: \nUm... Yeah...

To protect the art pieces, you know.\n???: \n...Welcome! To my private little \"Banquet of Chaos\".\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? What the heck does THAT mean...?)\n???: \nI'm afraid I have very little to offer, but please... make yourself at home.\nMaya: \nErr, umm... Who are you anyway...?\n???: \nSHHH! SILENCE! ...

A lawyer, and... a spirit medium. Neither very advanced at their trade! ...Am I wrong?\nMaya: \nYikes! Th-That's scary! H-How did you know that!?\n???: \n\"How\" you say? The universal skeptic would say that how is nothing but a question of why. I am traveler of both time and space, and a swimmer of dreams.\nMaya: \nWhat is he talking about? I can't make heads or tails of it...\n???: \nWithout further ado, let me fulfill what should be the first duty of any gentleman...\nAtmey:\n...and introduce myself. The name is Atmey... Luke Atmey! ...Ace Detective.\nPhoenix: \nOh... Umm... Hi.\nMaya: \nDon't let him intimidate you, Nick! Stand up and show him what you're made of!\nPhoenix: \nErr, umm... The name's Wright.

Why does the phrase \"one short of a baker's dozen\" come to mind with this guy?)\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting DeMasque's Calling Card:\nAtmey:\n... ...Well, Sir Lawyer. I've been told that you too are pursuing the mysterious thief.\nPhoenix:\n...Well, I'm not sure would say that exact--\nMaya:\nThat's right! We're going to find the Sacred Urn no matter what we have to do!\nAtmey:\n...Excellent. I will trust you. I permit you to take a look around while I investigate elsewhere.

You captured Mask☆DeMasque!?\nGumshoe:\nBingoooo! Well... Actually, he surrendered... ...But I still got him!\nPhoenix:\n(Mask☆DeMasque surrendered?)\nPearl:\nThat's great! So when can we come and pick up the Sacred Urn?\nGumshoe:\nUm, ahh, well ya see... I was gonna tell you...\nPhoenix:\nWhat...? Something wrong?\nGumshoe:\nDo you think you can swing by the detention center sometime?\nPhoenix:\nThe detention center...? (Changed from [Detention center...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nHe wants to talk to you... Mask☆DeMasque, that is.\nMaya:\nWhaaaat!? He wants to talk to Nick?\nGumshoe:\nI'll be waiting for you, pal. So get over here soon.\nPhone:\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\n(The detention center, huh?)\nOctober 12Atmey Detective Agency\nPhoenix:\nThis is a detective agency? Looks like more like the set of some B-grade horror movie.\nMaya:\nH-Hello? Is anyone here...?\n...\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like nobody's home.\nMaya:\nHmph. What a waste of time. Hey! I know! Let's take that framed picture back with us as a memento!\nPhoenix:\nDon't you dare, Maya! (Guess we'll have to try back later...)\nOctober 12\nDetention CenterVisitor's Room\nGumshoe:\nHey, pal!

So where's the Sacred Urn?\nGumshoe:\nOh, Sorry about that, pal... I guess I didn't really think about it before... But you're the \"victim\" in this case.\nMaya:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nWell, I guess I should let you guys hear the story straight from the horse's mouth.\nMaya:\nYou know, he's right, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nHe is?\nMaya:\nIf you think about it reeeeal hard, we are the victims!\nPhoenix:\nWell... I guess so... In a way...\n???:\nUmm...\nMaya:\nI'm so used to thinking of the victim as a dead person 'cause we're always on murder cases.\n???:\nEx-Excuse me...\nMaya:\nBut anyway! I have to get the Sacred Urn back!\n???:\nPleeeeease! Don't just ignore meeeeee! ...Err.\nMaya:\n...Um, who are you?\n???:\n...I, err, umm. I-I-I... I-I'm Ma-Ma-Ma...

Your husband told us that you wanted us to stop by.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nI'm Maya Fey, and this is Phoenix Wright, attorney at law.\nDesirée:\n\"Nicky boy\" and Maya, huh? I can't tell you how grateful I am that you decided to help my Ronnie.\nMaya:\nWell, um... Aha ha... You're welcome.\nPhoenix:\n(Did she really call me \"Nicky boy\"?)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nDesirée:\nSay... Can I ask you something, Nicky boy?\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it?\nDesirée:\nI know I may seem like a \"bad girl\" on the outside... But the one thing I won't stand for is illegal activity.\nMaya:\nI had the feeling you wouldn't! You're tough... But I can tell you've got a good heart. (Changed from [I had the feeling you didn't! You're tough... But I can tell you've got a good heart.] in the original release)\nDesirée:\nSomebody framed my poor Ronnie, I just know it. Umm... Could you give this to Ronnie for me?\nMaya:\nA letter?\nDesirée:\nYes, for Ronnie. I want him to fight back.\nMaya:\nMs. DeLite... OK, you've got it!

Mr. Lawyer?\nPhoenix:\nYes?\nRon:\nIn the letter that Dessie wrote, she said... \"Ask this guy to be your lawyer!\"\nMaya:\nHuh...?\nRon:\nErr, umm... I know this would be asking a lot, but... Could you please take my case? My trial starts tomorrow...\nMaya:\nHey, hang on a second! He can't be your lawyer!\nPhoenix:\nWhy not?\nMaya:\nWhat do you mean, \"why not\"!? We're the victims in this case, right!? Victims of this DeMasque guy!\nPhoenix:\nWell, yeah... But according to Desirée, he didn't do it...\nPearl:\nShe said, \"Poor man, he's deluded himself into thinking he did it.\" Right, Mr. Nick?\nMaya:\nCome on! She could be lying to protect her husband!\nPhoenix:\nW-Well, that's true. ...Err, no actually not. Actually it's hard to say (...Oh no, it's spreading!)\nRon:\nOh, please! I'll give you the treasure of your choice in return...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... What should I do?)\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick...! I-I was wrong about you...

Where's Pearls?\nMaya:\nShe said she's going back to the office. Go check in on her later, would you?\nPhoenix:\nAnd what about you...? Are you OK with me taking Mr. DeLite's case...?\nMaya:\nY-Yeah... I'm fine, Nick. I believe in you.\nPhoenix:\n... *sniffle* (I think I'm going to cry.)\nRon:\nUmm... I, err...

From the bottom of my heart, I apologize for what I said!\nPhoenix:\nAww, it's OK! I'm the one that should be apologizing!\nPearl:\nWell, I'm going out now for a little bit.\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? Wh-Where are you going...?\nPearl:\nI may be small, but I still have a lot of spirit channeling power! So I'm going to show you I can be useful too... By finding some evidence!\nPhoenix:\nHey!

A lawyer, and... a spirit medium. ...Am I correct?\nMaya:\n...Umm. I think we've already been through this.\nAtmey:\nHa! So my estimation was correct! Zvarri! ...How truly elegant. Now then, what can I do for you?\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\nWell it looks like we got one thing cleared up anyway.\nMaya:\nHuh? What? That Atmey is the greatest Ace Detective in the world?\nPhoenix:\nNo, that he never actually saw the thief.\nMaya:\nOh... that's right! So the thief may not even be Mask☆DeMasque...\nAtmey:\nJust one moment, Sir Lawyer! The thief was unquestionably Mask☆DeMasque!\nMaya:\nBut you never actually saw him!\nAtmey:\nPerhaps so, but I installed a security camera for just such a contingency.\nMaya:\nOh...\nAtmey:\nLast night, the camera went off exactly once. Behold! This is a photo of the dastardly thief, taken by the security camera!\nPhoenix:\n...Th-That's him!\nMaya:\nM-Mask☆DeMasque...!\nSecurity Camera Photo added to the Court Record.\nAtmey:\nThe thief can be none other than the arch-criminal, Mask☆DeMasque.

Nick! Remember what Detective Atmey said!?\nAtmey:\nExactly that. Mr. DeLite had a very good reason to dress up and commit those crimes.

Ever since grade school, he's been... Not exactly a close friend, but yeah, we know each other.\nButz:\nHey, man, that wasn't nice! I was your very first client!\nPhoenix:\nWe've got quite the... storied history, he and I.

Doesn't look like something's changed since we were here last?\nPhoenix:\n(Now that you mention it...)\nMaya:\nThis bag... I'm sure it wasn't here before.\nPearl:\nIt looks quite full... I wonder what could be in here?\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Come on! Open it up!\nPhoenix:\nHey! Wait a minute! We can't just open his private property!\nMaya:\nDon't be such a fuddy-duddy! This is an important investigation!\nPhoenix:\n(That's true... And truth be told, I have to admit I am kind of curious...)\nMaya:\nWell? What's in there?\nPhoenix:\nH-Hang on a sec. I'm taking it out now... (Whatever it is, it feels... kinda hard... and smooth...)\nAtmey:\n...Well, hello there!!\nMaya:\nEEEEEEK! H-He's here!\nAtmey:\n...What are you doing, Sir Lawyer? I'm shocked to see a servant of the court ignoring the law so flagrantly!\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm really sorry! M-Maya made me do it!\nMaya:\nNick! I can't believe you!\nAtmey:\nA gentlemen never uses a lady as an excuse for his own poor behavior... The real question is... Can you afford to waste time lollygagging about here?\nPhoenix:\nWh-What do you mean by that?\nAtmey:\nPerhaps I should make myself more clear? Tomorrow's trial... Zvarri! Shall we say the figurative Sir William will be dropping his panties before lunchtime?\nMaya:\nWow, Nick! Sounds like it's gonna be really exciting.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\n(It looks like we're done investigating for the day.)\nAtmey:\nHee hee hee hee hee... Sir Lawyer... The stage has been set and all the pieces are finally in place. All that remains now... is for the dance to begin!\nPhoenix:\n(A new prosecutor, an Ace Detective and a thief... This will be one tough trial.)\nTo be continued.\n\nOctober 13, 9:36 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 4\nMaya:\nHey, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it? Is something wrong...?\nMaya:\nNah. But did you see all the people here? It's crazy! Oh! So, check out the Mask☆DeMasque glossy I bought! (Changed from [Oh! Look at this! I bought this Mask☆DeMasque publicity photo!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nYou bought this... where? (Changed from [You bought that...? Where!?] in the original release)\nPearl:\nFrom the little tents in front of the courthouse. They have all sorts of things for sale!\nMaya:\nYou know I'm sucker for this kind of stuff!\nMask☆DeMasque Publicity Photo stuck into the Court Record.\nCome on! I'm guilty! Throw the book at meeee!\nPearl:\n...Who's screaming like that?\nRon:\n...Oh! Mr. Wright! You made it!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I did. But it doesn't look like things are going to get any less ugly for you...\nRon:\nBecause I did it!! I'm the criminal! Me! Me! Meeeeeee!\nMaya:\nUngh... He's at it again.\nRon:\nI sent the calling card to Lordly Tailor! I admit iiiit!!\nPhoenix:\nBut... You don't have the Sacred Urn, right?\nRon:\nWell, that's true, but... That doesn't mean that I didn't commit the crime.\nPhoenix:\n(Normally, when I say \"Of course you didn't\" I'm being sarcastic, but you... Yikes!)\nRon:\nAnyway, I admit that I'm guilty... So make sure they give me a guilty verdict! Pleeeeease!?\nDesirée:\nOh, there you are Ronnie! Bonjour, sweetie!\nRon:\nOh! D-Dessie honey! B-Bonjour! ...Well, actually... I don't really know why I should be speaking French to you at a time like this\nDesirée:\nLeave it all to me, Ronnie! I swear I'll protect you!\nRon:\nUmmm, errr... Aaah... Well, ahh... You see... Actually the thief is err, me\nDesirée:\nCan I tell you something, Nicky boy? I can guarantee that my Ronnie is innocent! If he's declared guilty, I'll be ever so cross with you!\nPhoenix:\n(So why are you smiling when you say it?)\nDesirée:\nWell, if you'll excuse me! I've got some errands I need to take care of! I'm counting on you, Nicky boy! Good luck!\nPhoenix:\n(To be honest, I really don't know whether Ron is Mask☆DeMasque or not. But there's only one thing I AM sure of. He doesn't have the Sacred Urn right now...)\nBailiff:\nMr. DeLite! It's time for you to enter the courtroom!\nPhoenix:\n(For the time being, I guess I'll have to trust Desirée...)\nOctober 13, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 6\nJudge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Ron DeLite.\nPhoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your honor.\n???:\n...\nJudge:\nWhat about the prosecution? Are you prepared to...\n???:\n...What a stupid question!\nJudge:\nWh-What did you say!\n???:\nFine. Let me ask you then, Your Honor. Are YOU ready? Are you ready to pass judgement?\nJudge:\nWh...! N-No, I... I'm not! I will pass judgement after I hear arguments from both sides.\n???:\nWell, if you're not ready yourself, you shouldn't expect others to be. That's a rule to live by.\nJudge:\n...Um, wh-who are you?\nGodot:\nI am Godot. Legendary prosecutor. I've never lost a case.\nMaya:\nAh! He's the one that Detective Atmey was talking about...\nJudge:\nYes, your reputation precedes you. What kind of cases have you dealt with so far?\nGodot:\nHa...! None.\nJudge:\nWhat did you say...?\nGodot:\nI've never prosecuted a case before.\nJudge:\nN-Never? But you said you've never lost before.\nGodot:\n...Exactly. I've never lost. I've never won before either.\nJudge:\nQuite arrogant for a beginner, aren't you?\nGodot:\nEven the mightiest of redwoods begin their lives as mere saplings.\nJudge:\nYes, but... A mask? In a court of law?\nGodot:\nHa...! Don't you know anything? No matter the man, we all wear masks... Either on our faces or ever our hearts.\nJudge:\n...!\nMaya:\nThis guy is the real deal alright, Nick...\nPhoenix:\n(Why does it seem like all prosecutors are the \"real deal\"...?)\nGodot:\nSo we finally meet... Mr. Phoenix Trite!\nPhoenix:\n...?\nMaya:\nN-Nick! Is he a friend of yours?\nPhoenix:\nNo. I don't have any friends that call me \"Trite\". (Just who is this masked man...?)\nGodot:\nI've returned from the depths of Hell... To do battle with you.\nJudge:\nWell then, err, Prosecutor Gobo.\nGodot:\nIt's not \"Gobo\". It's Godot... Your Honor.\nJudge:\nIn any case, please give your opening statement.\nGodot:\nOpening statement? Those things are not fit for even dogs to consume. I have only one thing to say before we start. To you... Mr. Trite.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What is it?\nGodot:\nAre you familiar with the saying, \"A chain is only as strong as its weakest link\"? I wonder... how much you can withstand before you and your case break in two...?\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\nHmm... Well then, let's hear from the first witness!\nGumshoe:\nUm, my name is...\nGodot:\nNo one asked for your name, witness.\nGumshoe:\n...Urk.\nGodot:\nThe important thing is what you know... That's all. Start talking. ...We're listening.\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir.\nJudge:\nAlright, witness. First, let's hear about... What you know about the thief that stole the urn.\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir!\nWitness Testimony\n-- Mask☆DeMasque's Crimes --\nGumshoe:\nMask☆DeMasque is a master thief that first started his crime spree 6 months ago.\nHe's so confident that he sends his calling card before he even commits the crime!\nThis was his fifth heist, and as usual, he sent a card on to Lordly Tailor.\nHis pattern is to always go after only the most precious art pieces.\nThat's why we're sure it was Mask☆DeMasque, sir. It fits his M. O. to a T!\nJudge:\nHmm... So then the actual identity of this Mask☆DeMasque is... M-Mr. Godot! W-What are you--!? (Changed from [M-Mr. Godot! Y-You!] in the original release) W-We're in the middle of a trial here, Mr. Godot!\nGodot:\nBlacker than a moonless night, hotter and more bitter than Hell itself... That is coffee. I'm sure you can grant me at least this much... Your Honor. Oh, please. Proceed.\nJudge:\n... Very well. It's only coffee, after all.\nPhoenix:\n(What!? You can't be letting him slide this early in the trial!)\nJudge:\nProceed with your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.\nMaya:\nWell, Nick? What are you going to do?\nPhoenix:\nAs long as they haven't brought up Mr. DeLite's identity... ...all we can do is show that it wasn't Mask☆DeMasque who stole the urn.\nCross Examination\n-- Mask☆DeMasque's Crimes --\nGumshoe:\nMask☆DeMasque is a master thief that first started his crime spree 6 months ago.\nGumshoe:\nHe's so confident that he sends his calling card before he even commits the crime!\nGumshoe:\nThis was his fifth heist, and as usual, he sent a card on to Lordly Tailor.\nGumshoe:\nHis pattern is to always go after only the most precious art pieces.\nGumshoe:\nThat's why we're sure it was Mask☆DeMasque, sir. It fits his M. O. to a T!\nMaya:\nNick! It definitely looks like it was Mask☆DeMasque who stole the urn!\nPhoenix:\nBut there's no real evidence either way as to whether Ron DeLite is Mask☆DeMasque.\nMaya:\nBut... But...\nPhoenix:\nAlso, the urn hasn't turned up yet, let alone in connection to Mr. DeLite himself.\nMaya:\nSo even though we know it was Mask☆DeMasque that did it...\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe for the time being, I should try to show it wasn't Mask☆DeMasque that did it!)\nPhoenix:\n...Can I ask you a little something, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\n...Just hearing the \"little\" in that question is making me nervous.\nPhoenix:\nYou said that he always \"goes after the most precious art pieces\", right?\nGumshoe:\nThat's right, pal.\nPhoenix:\nBut there's one problem... That's not what he did in this case. The supposedly \"priceless\" urn doesn't exactly rise to the level of \"precious art\"!\nGumshoe:\nWh-What do you mean!?\nMaya:\nN-Nick! How can you say such a terrible thing!?\nPhoenix:\nNo! I meant from a financial point of view! I mean, it wouldn't fetch a good price.\nJudge:\nWell, Prosecutor Godot? What is the value of that urn?\nGodot:\nThe appraisers I spoke to said they couldn't attach a price to it. And I mean that in the worst sense.\nPhoenix:\nSo in other words... It was not the kind of item that Mask☆DeMasque would normally go after!\nGumshoe:\nUrk!\nJudge:\nHmm... If I understand you correctly, Mr. Wright... ...you're saying that the theft of the Sacred Urn was not the work of Mask☆DeMasque...!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes... That's what I'm saying. (Actually all I did was point out the contradiction. The argument made itself, but...)\nJudge:\nWell... First of all, we need to get this issue cleared up. Was this last robbery the work of Mask☆DeMasque or not? What do you have to say about this, Mr. Godot?\nGodot:\nThis coffee here... It's my own special blend. I call it Godot #107. I'm trying to decide whether to cut down on the acidity or the bitterness... That's the only thing I've got on my mind right now... ...Mr. Trite!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!?\nGodot:\nIf you're really a man, you should clean up your own mess.\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Sorry, but I didn't get what you mean.\nGodot:\nIf you're saying it wasn't Mask☆DeMasque that stole the urn... ...then it must be someone imitating Mask☆DeMasque's methods... A fake.\nJudge:\nA-A Fake☆DeMasque?\nMaya:\nFake☆DeMasque? That sounds so ridiculous. ...But I like it.\nGodot:\nNow, before I decide on my coffee, I believe some proof is in order, Mr. Trite. Proof that the person who appeared at Lordly Tailor that night was actually a fake.\nJudge:\nHmm... Though I don't approve of Mr. Godot's behavior, his point is valid. Mr. Wright. ...We're waiting.\nPhoenix:\n(It looks like I'm going to have to prove it... I need proof that the person at Lordly Tailor that night was in fact, Fake☆DeMasque!)\nPhoenix:\nThe proof is right here.\nJudge:\nThis looks like... a photo taken by a security camera.\nPhoenix:\nBut if you look closely... you'll notice something peculiar about it.\nGodot:\nHa...! Well then, why don't you go ahead and show us what it is. Go on. Use this pointer and show us just what about this picture is so \"peculiar\".\nPhoenix:\nIt's right here, of course!\nJudge:\nYou mean... Mask☆DeMasque?\nPhoenix:\nI have here a piece of reference I would like the court to take a look at.\nMaya:\nIsn't that the publicity photo I bought this morning...?\nPhoenix:\nThe problem I have with the security camera photo is the broach on DeMasque's chest.\nJudge:\nA Breach? Here!? Bailiff! Get my steed! We need to retreat at once!\nPhoenix:\n...A broach, Your Honor. It's a sort of clasp for holding one's cape on.\nJudge:\nA clasp, eh... Ah! I see now!\nGumshoe:\nBut the Mask☆DeMasque in the security camera photo... Ahh!! He has no broach!!\nPhoenix:\nThat broach is the same as the emblem on DeMasque's calling card and serves as his symbol. But the thief that broke into Lordly Tailor wasn't wearing a broach... In other words, this \"Mask☆DeMasque\" is a fake!\nGumshoe:\n...! I-I've been fooled agaaaaaain!\nJudge:\nO-Order! It's true... Undeniably true... Detective Gumshoe! How... How could you have overlooked this!?\nGumshoe:\nI-I'm sorry, sir! I don't know how I...\nGodot:\nHey now... ...If you're gonna have a pity party, invite me, too!\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Godot! You deserve some blame in this, too! How could you have overlooked such a large broach...?\nGodot:\nHa...! The broach you're talking about... Do you mean this?\nGumshoe:\nAh...!\nPhoenix:\nTh-That's...! Mask☆DeMasque's broach!\nJudge:\nWh-Where did you find it!?\nGodot:\nWell I've always had a good nose for evidence... I got it at the crime scene. It was hidden in the shadow of a big female Buddha statue.\nPhoenix:\n(\"Buddha statue\"...? He must mean the Ami Fey statue.)\nGumshoe:\nWh-Why didn't you tell me about that, sir!?\nGodot:\n...I always put evidence away in my pocket. ...After all, it's the safest place for crucial evidence.\nMaya:\nGrrr... This guy is one cool customer.\nGodot:\nIt's a little early to be shaken up, isn't it, little lady? ...That friend of yours left pretty little hickeys on there, too.\nJudge:\nH-Hickeys?\nGodot:\nFiguratively speaking, of course... I'm referring to Ron DeLite's fingerprints.\nGumshoe:\nWhaaa...?\nJudge:\nWhat!? The defendant's fingerprints are on the broach!? Order! Order in the court! Mr. Godot! Let's see that broach!\nGodot:\nI've grown attached to my metallic girlfriend here. ...Take good care of her.\nJudge:\nHmm... She-- I mean, it appears to have been torn off some clothing. There's a little bit of cloth left on the back.\nGodot:\nObviously there must have been a big struggle that night at the crime scene.\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh... Phoenix, we have a problem...)\nDeMasque's Broach added to the Court Record.\nGodot:\nHa...! You mess with Godot... ...and you get burned.\nPhoenix:\n(Grr... He's been playing me like a violin...)\nGodot:\nWell Judge, I'm about ready to call my next witness.\nGumshoe:\nHuh? You're done with me? But I haven't proved anything yet.\nGodot:\nYou've proven your own incompetence. That's good enough.\nGumshoe:\n...That doesn't sound good at all.\nJudge:\nBailiff! Bring the next witness into the courtroom!\nPhoenix:\n(Finally time for the Ace Detective to make his appearance, huh...?)\nGodot:\nOne second is one drip of the coffee pot. Let's hurry it up.\nAtmey:\nSHHH! SILENCE!... Hee hee hee hee hee... Now I see. It's all becoming clear.\nJudge:\nWh-What's clear?\nAtmey:\n...Zvarri! The truth has once again been elegantly revealed to me! What we have here is... A judge and a prosecutor. ...A coffee maniac, at that! ...Am I correct?\nJudge:\nW-Well, yes. That's right.\nGodot:\nHa...! Not bad. Not bad at all. You're the first person that's ever been able to penetrate my secret veil.\nAtmey:\nWell, Sir Prosecutor. Let me introduce myself. My name is Luke Atmey, Ace Detective and rising star illuminating the heavens.\nMaya:\nBoy, these two make a perfect pair...\nPhoenix:\nThey'd either be best friends or they'd tear each other's heads off.\nJudge:\nI've heard that on the night of the crime, you were all alone on security detail.\nAtmey:\n...You have heard correctly. My specially-made monocle is worth more than a hundred Detective Gumshoes. ...If Detective Gumshoe was worth anything, that is.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\n(Why was this guy all by himself anyway...? There must be some reason. I'm sure of it!)\nJudge:\nWell then, tell us what this special monocle of yours witnessed!\nWitness Testimony\n-- What I Witnessed --\nAtmey:\nIt was approximately 1 o'clock in the morning... just after the date changed.\nThat's when my nemesis, the infamous Mask☆DeMasque, dancingly descended upon me!\nJust as I began to turn, the coward struck a fierce blow upon my noble head!\nDarkness swallowed me before I could land a single strike. When I awoke, he was gone.\nThirty minutes later, I used an emergency phone to notify the police!\nJudge:\nSo you didn't get a clear look at the criminal?\nAtmey:\nMy specially-made monocle never misses a thing. However! That is limited to things that fall within my own visual range! But of course, that's only natural.\nJudge:\n...I fall to see why the witness seems so proud of his performance that evening.\nAtmey:\nWell, Sir Old-Timer, let me explain. We are not speaking of any ordinary thief... ...but of the kings of thieves! The great Mask☆DeMasque, my arch-enemy! That is what my instincts and my years of experience tell me!\nJudge:\nHmm... Very well. Proceed with the cross-examination, Mr. Wright.\nCross Examination\n-- What I Witnessed --\nAtmey:\nIt was approximately 1 o'clock in the morning... just after the date changed.\nAtmey:\nThat's when my nemesis, the infamous Mask☆DeMasque, dancingly descended upon me!\nAtmey:\nJust as I began to turn, the coward struck a fierce blow upon my noble head!\nAtmey:\nDarkness swallowed me before I could land a single strike. When I awoke, he was gone.\nAtmey:\nThirty minutes later, I used an emergency phone to notify the police!\nMaya:\nThere's something suspicious about Detective Atmey... How could he not have noticed when the thief came in?\nPhoenix:\nAlso, he says he was knocked unconscious before he could fight back... But that can't be right. It contradicts the evidence.\nMaya:\nHuh? Which piece...?\nPhoenix:\n(The real question is... Why would he tell such an obvious lie?)\nPhoenix:\n...Mr. Atmey. Could you take a look at this with that special monocle of yours?\nAtmey:\nAha! This belongs to the criminal mastermind, my arch-nemesis, Mask☆DeMasque! It is, in point of fact, Mask☆DeMasque's broach!\nPhoenix:\nIt was found on the floor of the basement warehouse. I wonder how that happened?\nAtmey:\nHa... Elementary, my dear lawyer. Obviously it wasn't glued on well enough.\nPhoenix:\nNot quite. It clearly shows signs of having been ripped off a piece of clothing.\nJudge:\nRipped off...? Aha!\nPhoenix:\n...We can only deduce that the thief struggled with someone that night! That's the only thing I can think of. And there's only one person that was in a position to have a struggle with the thief. The only person that was on security duty that night...You, Detective Atmey!\nAtmey:\n...Urk!\nPhoenix:\nDetective Atmey! You must have fought with the thief that night! (Changed from [Detective Atmey! You must have fought with the thief last night!] in the original release) So, why did you lie in your testimony to the court?\nJudge:\nWitness! Giving false testimony is a serious crime!\nAtmey:\nErr, I... N-No! W-Wait just a moment, Sir Old-Timer!\nJudge:\nDon't talk to me like I'm living in a nursing home!\nAtmey:\nHee hee hee he he he... I just remembered, Your Honor. I was just confused because I've been dealing with so many cases lately.\nGodot:\nThe true measure of a man is in the amount of work he does. That's what I always say.\nMaya:\nNick, you can only handle one case at a time... Isn't that right?\nPhoenix:\nYou talk too much.\nJudge:\nWitness! So are you now saying that you and the thief fought?\nGodot:\nHold on. That's quite enough... Your Honor.\nJudge:\nE-Excuse me...?\nGodot:\nSave the big questions for the testimony. That's one of my rules.\nAtmey:\nIndeed! I understand! I, Luke Atmey, agree completely!\nWitness Testimony\n-- Fight With The Thief --\nAtmey:\nIndeed, it's true that I looked away from the door for a brief moment.\nHowever... Luke Atmey cannot be so easily discombobulated!\nUnfortunately, the thief grabbed a weapon from the side and... rendered me senseless.\nA true gentleman fights only with his own fists... But they were not enough.\nHis first blow struck true! Bam! ...And that's all she wrote.\nJudge:\nSo in the end, you did catch a glimpse of Mask☆DeMasque?\nAtmey:\nCorrect. It was during his third crime that he struck me from behind. It seems that my memory has become a tad jumbled, so to speak.\nJudge:\nHmmm... Well, that's certainly understandable. I, myself, always get confused about which testimony goes with which case.\nPhoenix:\n(Th-That can't be good...)\nCross Examination\n-- Fight With The Thief --\nAtmey:\nIndeed, it's true that I looked away from the door for a brief moment.\nAtmey:\nHowever... Luke Atmey cannot be so easily discombobulated!\nAtmey:\nUnfortunately, the thief grabbed a weapon from the side and... rendered me senseless.\nAtmey:\nA true gentleman fights only with his own fists... But they were not enough.\nAtmey:\nHis first blow struck true! Bam! ...And that's all she wrote.\nAtmey:\nI put my back to the wall to fight, but the thief's blow landed upon my third eye.\nMaya:\nWell what do you think, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nWell, there's one thing that I'm absolutely sure of now.\nMaya:\nYeah? What is it!?\nPhoenix:\nThe Luke Atmey guy... He's definitely hiding something!\nMaya:\nB-But why?\nPhoenix:\nI think I'm starting to figure out what really happened that night. (...And about the true nature of this \"detective\".)\nPhoenix:\nDetective Atmey! Your testimony is crumbling like a house of cards.\nAtmey:\nWhat fun this is, Sir Lawyer! It is truly a pleasure to cross swords with you! And now, once again, you have thrown down the gauntlet at my armored feet...\nPhoenix:\nI believe this is what you said yesterday.\nAtmey:\nNo, the coward must have wormed his way in through somewhere besides the door... Then my arch-nemesis struck me on the head from behind with this gruesome item here!\nJudge:\nFrom behind, huh?\nPhoenix:\nBut just now you testified that he struck you on the forehead... I hardly think you could forget where you were hit on the head!\nAtmey:\n...Urk! It seems... I-I've made another mistake.\nPhoenix:\n...Detective Atmey. That's not the only strange part of your testimony.\nJudge:\nWh-What do you mean by that?\nPhoenix:\nFor example... The very fact that you hid the calling card from the police itself is strange! It's almost as if... You were afraid they were going to help with security!\nAtmey:\nU-Urk...! Geniuses such as myself have always been misunderstood! How sad...\nPhoenix:\nThat's wrong!\nGodot:\nGodot:\n...To err is human, to forgive divine. Humans aren't machines... They have souls, feelings. They live, they die, they love, they hate... And yes, they even make mistakes...\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHey, hold on! It-It's not as pretty as that!\nGodot:\nReally? What is it like then!?\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nAlways chase a riddle down to the end. That's one of my rules.\nPhoenix:\n(This is it... This might just be my chance to turn things around!)\nJudge:\n...Mr. Wright. What exactly is it that you're asserting?\nPhoenix:\nVery well, Your Honor. The defense asserts that...\nPhoenix:\nThe answer is simple! It's all clear to me now! Detective Luke Atmey's true identity is actually... Mask☆DeMasque!\nAtmey:\nYeeeeaaargggh!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Mr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!?\nPhoenix:\nThere are too many unnatural parts to Mr. Atmey's story. He says he was \"hiding\" at the crime scenes, which is why no one ever saw him there. And then, in his last case, he manages to outperform Detective Gumshoe and... ...the entire police force to \"miraculously\" retrieve the stolen treasure.\nAtmey:\nTh-That's because... I analyzed the crime scene data and made an exquisitely elegant deduction. I picked up clues that the police overlooked in order to arrive at a...\nPhoenix:\nOh, please! The explanation is far simpler than that, \"Detective Atmey\"! The truth is that you are, in fact, Mask☆DeMasque.\nAtmey:\nGurk...!\nJudge:\nB-But Mr. Wright! Th-This photo! It clearly shows Mask☆DeMasque! This security camera belongs to Lordly Tailor Department Store! He shouldn't have been able to manipulate it...\nPhoenix:\nHe didn't need to manipulate it! He gained access to the warehouse under the pretense of providing \"security\"... Then he simply dressed as the \"thief\" and stole the urn.\nJudge:\nSo... the Ace Detective is actually an Ace Thief! Is this true, witness!?\nAtmey:\n... Aha... Hee hee hee ha ha ha Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ho ho ho hee hee hee! DeMasque's M. O. is pure genius! And so am I, Luke Atmey, Ace Detective!! You're very clever to have come to such a conclusion! I am impressed, Sir Lawyer!\nJudge:\nWh-Whaaaaat!? Witness! You... You're admitting it!?\nMaya:\nN-Nick! Now's your chance!\nPhoenix:\nYes! Time to put the last nail in this guy's coffin! Detective Atmey! When you assumed the thief's identity--\nGodot:\nGodot:\nGodot Blend #102... ...My personal favorite.\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Godot!\nGodot:\n\"The Ace Detective is actually an Ace Thief!\" I smell a best-selling novel! There's only one problem... It simply isn't true.\nJudge:\nB-But Mr. Godot! Mr. Wright has made some very strong points and I...\nGodot:\nI will admit my opponent has woven a compelling narrative out of whole cloth. But it is, in fact, nothing more than a patchwork quilt. Mr. Trite... If this detective really is the thief, then show us the proof of your claim. But it had better be as hot... and as perfect as the coffee dripping down your face!\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Wright!? Don't just stand there! This court would like to see this decisive proof you have! Quickly!\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? Oh! Y-Yes, of course! (Wh-What's the big rush...?)\nMaya:\nAre you alright, Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Atmey looks pretty rattled right now... I'd like to finish this right now if I can. But can I really do it?) The decisive evidence that proves Mr. Luke Atmey is in fact Mask☆DeMasque...\nPhoenix:\nProof? Of course I... I... ...I've got nothing.\nGodot:\nHa...! Just what I thought. A man has to told his head up high no matter how bad things get, after all.\nPhoenix:\nUuugh...\nJudge:\nI see... I thought perhaps you had some evidence to back up your assertion...\nPhoenix:\n(This is no good! I've got to stay on the attack! I'll never get another chance to prove that this guy is the thief!)\nMaya:\nDon't give up, Nick! Think harder and try again!\nPhoenix:\nIt's no good... I'm just not ready yet...\nMaya:\nB-But... Are you going to just give up and let us lose this?\nAtmey:\nSo, you've come to your senses, have you, Sir Lawyer?\nPhoenix:\nI... Unnngh... (Argh! I can't think of a counter-attack at all...)\nJudge:\nIt seems the cloud of suspicion surrounding this witness has lifted. Mr. Godot. If you have anything further to add, then--\n???:\nJudge:\nWh... Wh-Who... ...Who are you?\nDesirée:\nThat doesn't really matter right now, does it?\nPhoenix:\nMs. DeLite! What are you doing here?\nDesirée:\nNicky boy! The thing you've been looking for... I think I found it!\nJudge:\nYou mean... that bag!?\nDesirée:\nNo, not the bag! What's in the bag! ...Well?\nJudge:\nTh-That's...\nMaya:\nThe Sacred Urn!! Nick! It's the urn!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order! ...You! Madame...! That urn... Where did you find it!?\nDesirée:\nYou'll never believe it... It was in the office of Mr. Fancy Pants Ace Detective! ...Luke Atmey!\nRon:\nOh, Dessie! You're the best!\nSacred Urn updated in the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nWell? How do you explain that one, Mr. Atmey!?\nAtmey:\n...\nPhoenix:\nEven you are going to have a hard time weaseling out of this one!\nGodot:\nGodot:\nHa...! Pathetic...\nJudge:\nMr. Godot...? Do you have something you wish to say?\nGodot:\nYes, Your Honor... It simply amazes me how quickly times change... In the old days, a man was to be taken at his word. It's truly sad...\nJudge:\nYou're still denying that Mr. Atmey was involved!?\nGodot:\nBefore casting aspersions at Detective Atmey, consider the young lady here. Your name is Desirée... Desirée DeLite. Is that correct?\nDesirée:\nY-Yes! What about it?\nGodot:\nHa...! How charming... The lengths that a woman is willing to go to save her husband is truly inspiring.\nDesirée:\nWh-What are you insinuating!?\nGodot:\nAs the wife of the criminal, you could have \"discovered\" that stolen urn anywhere. Including the office of the good detective here. So you found the urn. What does that prove? It certainly doesn't prove where the urn was before you \"found\" it.\nDesirée:\nWhat...? I just brought it here from the detective's office!\nGodot:\nPlease Madame... This town is already filled to the brim with lies. Any more could only compound the tragedy we have been witness to.\nDesirée:\nYou're wrong! I would never...! I would never do such a thing!\nPhoenix:\nMs. DeLite...\nDesirée:\nPlease, Nicky boy! You've got to help me talk some sense into these people!\nPhoenix:\n(There must be some way! I've got to prove that urn was actually in the Atmey Detective Agency...)\nAtmey:\nSo what is all this fuss about fingerprints anyway...?\nPhoenix:\nMr. Atmey... Do you recall the events of yesterday?\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Come on! Open it up!\nPhoenix:\nHey! Wait a minute! We can't just open his private property!\nMaya:\nDon't be such a fuddy-duddy! This is an important investigation! Well? What's in there?\nPhoenix:\nH-Hang on a sec. I'm taking it out now... (Whatever it is, it feels... kinda hard... and smooth...)\nAtmey:\n...Well, hello there!!\nPhoenix:\nIt's true that I didn't get a chance to look in the bag at that time. But! I did touch what was inside.\nAtmey:\nWh-What!? Y-You touched it...?\nPhoenix:\nAnd I remember it very well. It was \"smooth and hard\".\nAtmey:\nW-Well, err... Th-That was just...\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! I'd like the court to examine the fingerprints on that urn. If my fingerprints are on there... Then it proves that the urn was in Detective Atmey's office!\nGodot:\nGodot:\nWell, even if your fingerprints are on the urn... ...it still doesn't prove when they were put there, does it?\nPhoenix:\nOf course it does.\nGodot:\nWh-What did you just say!?\nPhoenix:\nIt's not what I say, it's what Adrian Andrews, the person in charge of the exhibition said. (Changed from [Not what I said, it's what Adrian Andrews, the person in charge of the exhibition said.] in the original release)\nAndrews:\nI polished it until it was just about glowing... I thought maybe I could make it looks more valuable!\nPhoenix:\nIf she polished it that much, she must have removed any and all fingerprints on it. And the only chance I had to get my fingerprints on it after that was... Yesterday! At the Atmey Detective Agency!\nGodot:\nHa...! This blend... Godot Blend #107... I've decided... It's a little too bitter after all!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order! I accept the defense's request! Bailiff! Take this urn and...\nAtmey:\nWait! Wait a moment, Your Honor! ...There's no need for that.\nJudge:\nN-No need you say...?\nAtmey:\nPrecisely... I already know Mr. Wright's fingerprints are on the urn...\nJudge:\nWh-What are you saying!\nPhoenix:\n(Yes! I've finally broken him down!)\nAtmey:\nHee hee hee ha ha ha Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ho ho ho hee hee! Take a good look, everyone! Unable to find a rival worthy of my genius, I was forced to create one by myself! Here I am! The tragic clown...\nMaya:\nThis guy is nuttier than a fruitcake...\nAtmey:\nYou see! It was me all along! I am the one and only Mask☆DeMasque! Ha ha! I hope you all enjoyed my little performance! Hee hee hee ha ha ha Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ho ho ho hee hee hee!\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Godot... What's Mr. Atmey's condition?\nGodot:\nHe's still in the lobby, laughing insanely, Your Honor. I wish I could enjoy the joke as much as he seems to be.\nJudge:\nWell, it looks like the matter has been settled. I came perilously close to besmirching the record of an innocent young man. Besmirching him with the title of \"thief\"!\nMaya:\nNick, you were right after all!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah! I guess Mr. DeLite really wasn't the thief!)\nJudge:\nThe court finds the defendant, Mr. Ron DeLite...\n???:\nRon:\nYou're wrong! Wrong I tell you! Err, umm, I mean... Not exactly wrong so much, but actually not right is what I really trying to say\nPhoenix:\n(Oh no... He's not... This can't be happening...)\nRon:\nThe thief... The sneaky, odious thief who's been stealing all the treasures... It's me! I'm him! I'm the one you want! I'm the thief I tell you! So do it...! Pronounce me guilty! Pleeeease!!\nPhoenix:\n...\nGodot:\n...\n............\nJudge:\nI don't know what kind of a kangaroo court you all think this is, but...\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThe true identity of the thief has already been proven! Please hurry and pass judg--\nRon:\nWhat are you talking about!? I already confessed! I'm the thief I tell you!\nJudge:\n...Mr. Godot! Don't just stand there drinking coffee!\nGodot:\nHa...! Hey there, Mr. Thief...\nRon:\nY-Yes! Yes, sir!?\nGodot:\nIf you're really a man, then clean up your own mess.\nRon:\nI-I'm sorry... I'm afraid I just don't have any idea what do you mean.\nGodot:\nIf you are Mask☆DeMasque... then prove it. That's what it means.\nRon:\nY-Yes, sir! I'll be happy to!\nMaya:\nHe says he'll be happy to, Nick...\nPhoenix:\nIt's kinda cute... He's 100% committed to his fantasy.\nGodot:\nGood boy! Just remember one thing. A boy only gets one chance in his life to become a man!\nRon:\nI-I know that! I-I won't fail! I swear!\nGodot:\nOK, then... Talk! ...We're all listening.\nJudge:\nOh well... Let's all have a listen to this \"confession\"...\nWitness Testimony\n-- Mask☆DeMasque's Identity --\nRon:\nThe truth is, I've been Mask☆DeMasque all along!\nI mean, you can't prove that I'm not actually Mask☆DeMasque, can you?\nI don't have an alibi for the night the urn was stolen, after all!\nI donned my costume that night and dancingly descended upon the scene of the crime!\nLook! You can see right there in the photo! That's me!\nAs for my broach, I snagged it on the door handle and it got torn off, that's all!\nJudge:\nHmm... I don't like the direction this trial has taken...\nPhoenix:\n(But this is how every trial goes... At least with me, anyway...)\nGodot:\nHa...! You're doing great!\nRon:\nHee hee hee... Stop it, Mr. Godot... You're embarrassing me.\nGodot:\nLike I said, you're only going to get one chance to testify, alright? But if you make it through this with flying colors, I'll keep my promise, too. I'll make sure you stay locked up in prison as the one and only true Mask☆DeMasque!\nRon:\nThanks so much, Mr. Godot! I... I'll do my best!\nJudge:\nAlright, Mr. Wright. I'm afraid it's time for the cross-examination.\nPhoenix:\n*sigh*\nCross Examination\n-- Mask☆DeMasque's Identity --\nRon:\nThe truth is, I've been Mask☆DeMasque all along!\nRon:\nI mean, you can't prove that I'm not actually Mask☆DeMasque, can you?\nRon:\nI don't have an alibi for the night the urn was stolen, after all!\nRon:\nI donned my costume that night and dancingly descended upon the scene of the crime!\nRon:\nLook! You can see right there in the photo! That's me!\nRon:\nAs for my broach, I snagged it on the door handle and it got torn off, that's all!\nMaya:\nWhy does Mr. DeLite want to be Mask☆DeMasque so badly anyway? It's kinda disturbing. He doesn't seem like your typical attention whore to me. Unlike, say... you, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nI am nothing of the sort, thank you very much. (But I gotta admit it is kinda scary the way Ron acts...)\nMaya:\nAnyway... Time to poke some holes in that testimony of his!\nPhoenix:\nMr. DeLite. This wallet belongs to you, correct?\nRon:\nAh! Y-Yes. It-It does. I-I had lost it somewhere!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! When you find a wallet, you should report it to the police right away!\nPhoenix:\nAh! No! You don't understand. This is an important piece of evidence.\nJudge:\n\"Evidence\"...?\nPhoenix:\nMr. DeLite... When did you first notice that you'd lost your wallet?\nRon:\nErr, let's see... I think it was on the night of the crime... But I know I still had it when Dessie and I went out for dinner.\nPhoenix:\nThis wallet was found at approximately 1:00 AM at KB Security headquarters.\nJudge:\nWhat...!? Surely you're not serious!?\nPhoenix:\nYes... I am serious. This proves that Mr. DeLite was, in fact, at KB Security that night!\nRon:\nNoooooo!\nPhoenix:\nSo if the defendant was at KB Security at 1 o'clock in the morning... ...then that proves that he has a watertight alibi!\nRon:\nNoooooo!\nPhoenix:\nFurthermore, considering the distance between Lordly Tailor and KB Security... ...it would have taken 30 minutes to get there by car! (According to Larry anyway...)\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Godot!? Do you have anything to say? And stop drinking that coffee!\nGodot:\n...Come on, Mr. Thief. Don't let this guy beat you! Tell him why he's wrong!\nRon:\nYou're the only one who calls me \"thief\", Mr. Godot... ...Alright, I'll try! I-I'll do it! I will!\nMaya:\n...He's really got Mr. DeLite all worked up...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, he's like a kid at his first day of school...\nRon:\nLook, it's just ridiculous! Why would I have dropped my wallet at KB Security!? Someone must have planted it there to make it LOOK like I was there and not at the heist.\nMaya:\n\"Planted it there\"? He's really reaching now...\nPhoenix:\nMr. DeLite. You probably dropped your wallet when you took it out to use this, didn't you? The key card to KB Security's CEO's office.\nRon:\nNoooo!\nGodot:\nHa...! That was a pretty good try, Mr. Trite... Unfortunately, you've overlooked one small thing.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What...?\nGodot:\n\"Motive\" of course! Why would this thief go to KB Security in the middle of the night anyway!?\nJudge:\nHmm... Well, Mr. Wright? It looks like you need some more evidence after all.\nPhoenix:\n(Grrr! This stupid kid...!)\nJudge:\nNow then. Let's see your evidence. The evidence that shows why Mr. DeLite went to KB Security at 1 AM that night!\nPhoenix:\nMr. DeLite... I believe you've seen this before, correct?\nRon:\nAh...! Th-That's...!\nJudge:\nWhat is it?\nPhoenix:\nA blackmail letter. That's what it looks like from the contents.\nGodot:\nB-Blackmail...?\nPhoenix:\nYes, basically it says, \"bring $50,000 dollars\". [sic]\nJudge:\nHmm... That certainly sounds like blackmail alright...\nPhoenix:\nAt the time of the theft, Mr. DeLite was dealing with the blackmailer himself... ...in KB Security's CEO office, a full half an hour away from the scene of the crime!\nGodot:\n...Ungh... Urk... No No No No No NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! OOOOORDER!! So when the theft of the urn occurred, the defendant was at KB Security... It looks like a perfect case for the defense!\nGodot:\nGodot:\n...You may see it as a perfect case, Judge, but to me... Well, let's just say that my Godot Blend #107 impresses me a lot more.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What are you trying to say?\nGodot:\nYou say the thief was being blackmailed by the CEO of a security company... But... Did you actually investigate this CEO at all?\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? Well, umm... No... I guess not.\nGodot:\nAccusing a man of blackmail with no proof? I'm not sure what I think of that...\nPhoenix:\n(\"Not sure what I think of that\"...? At least I know what I think of you...)\nJudge:\nHmm... Good point. I'm not sure what I think of it myself... You claim that the defendant entered the CEO's office... ...but you will need at least one witness to corroborate your claim, Mr. Wright.\nMaya:\nNick! I think we're going to have to track down the CEO guy...\nPhoenix:\nNo, we don't have to track down the CEO at all.\nGodot:\nWhat do you mean by that, Mr. Trite?\nPhoenix:\nThere is someone else who can testify. This is the person who can testify that the key card was used at 1 AM that night!\nJudge:\nWh-Who is this useless-looking young man?\nPhoenix:\nYou don't remember him, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nHmmmm... Not exactly... But just looking at his picture makes the bile start to rise in my throat.\nMaya:\nIt looks like he doesn't remember the case from 2 years ago...\nPhoenix:\nHe probably blocked out that memory on purpose. Anyway, this man was working as a guard at KB Security that night.\nGodot:\nOh...?\nPhoenix:\nThe question at hand is this key card.\nButz:\nYup. That's the key card they use at the building I work in. According to the serial number, this one is for the CEO's office. You need it to get into that room, and every time you use that card, it leaves a record.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\nAs you can see, there's no need to investigate the CEO of KB Security! We should be able to discover the truth simply by analyzing this key card's data!\nGodot:\nBwaaaah...!\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Godot?\nGodot:\nThe name of the CEO of KB Security is Kane Bullard. I was unable to contact him directly, but... I got the key card data. ...Here.\nJudge:\nS-So what does it show!?\nGodot:\nEach key card has its own serial number and they leave detailed records of their use. According to this data... this card was used at 1 AM on the morning of the crime.\nKey Card updated in the Court Record.\nJudge:\nBut that means... it can't be Mr. DeLite dressed as Mask☆DeMasque in this photo!\nGodot:\nHa...! It looks like you're right. Two minutes isn't even enough time to brew a good cup o' Joe...\nPhoenix:\nSo... So then...!\nGodot:\nRon DeLite was clearly in the office of KB Security's CEO at the time of the crime. ...The prosecutor's office is ready to admit that fact. Therefore, it's impossible for the defendant to be Mask☆DeMasque.\nMaya:\nGood job! You did it, Nick!\nJudge:\n...That's enough! I came perilously close to besmirching the record of an innocent young man. Besmirching him with the title of \"thief\"! ...\nPhoenix:\nWh-What's wrong, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nI'm ready to pass judgement... But before I do that, do you have any further objections?\nPhoenix:\nNo, Your Honor!\nGodot:\nHrpmh...!\nRon:\nUnnnggh...\nJudge:\n...Very well. The court finds the defendant, Mr. Ron DeLite...\nNot Guilty\nJudge:\nCourt is now adjourned!

She's nobody... She's just ahh...\nPearl:\nYou're blushing! How dare you do this in front of Mystic Maya! You should be ashamed of yourself!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeowch! She slapped me...)\nMaya:\nUmm, Pearly... This woman is Ms. Desirée DeLite. She's our client's wife.\nPearl:\n*gasp!* Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes!?\nPearl:\nYou're even worse than I thought! Going behind the back of your own client...!\nPhoenix:\nN-N-No! You've got it all wrong!\nPearl:\nI'll never forgive you!\nPhoenix:\n(Owww... A double slap...)\nMaya:\nWell, anyway, All's well that ends well, right? We got the Sacred Urn back and the thief has been caught!\nDesirée:\nYou're so right! And it's all thanks to Nicky boy here!\nMaya:\nBut actually it was you, Ms. DeLite, that brought us our urn back! Thank you from the bottom of my heart!\nDesirée:\nOh, please... You're embarrassing me!\nPhoenix:\n(If we won the case... ...then why does this guy still look so glum...?)\nRon:\nUgggh... But I am the thief... Actually, what's the point now\nDesirée:\n...What is it, honey? I did my best for you, Ronnie!\nRon:\nI-I know that and I appreciate it, Dessie... But the thing is...\nGodot:\nCome on... Give the kid some time. He's just got a little touch of the blues. You know about feeling blue, right, amigo?\nPhoenix:\nM-Mr. Godot! What are you doing here!?\nGodot:\nOh come on! I just came here to say thanks to my newest buddy... ...You, Mr. Trite.\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe you should learn my name before you call me \"buddy\"...)\nGodot:\nWell, playtime is over.\nPhoenix:\nHuh...?\nGodot:\nEarly this morning... the body of Kane Bullard was discovered.\nMaya:\nKane Bullard...? Where have I heard that name before?\nDesirée:\nIsn't that... the name of the CEO of KB Security?\nMaya:\nWait. B-Body...!? (Changed from [B-Body...?] in the original release)\nGodot:\nThe estimated time of death was 1 AM on October 12th.\nPhoenix:\n1 AM on October 12th...? Y-You don't mean!?\nGodot:\n...That's right, amigo. At the same time that a cheap little urn was being stolen... ...the CEO of KB Security was being murdered.\nPhoenix:\nS-So then... What are you doing here?\nGodot:\nOh come on. You've figured it out already, haven't you amigo? Or... Have you already forgotten about that piece of info I helped you out with today?\nPhoenix:\n(\"Helped me out\"? What!?)\nGodot:\nOn October 12th, at 1 o'clock in the morning... Ron DeLite was in the CEO's office... ...The scene of the murder. After getting that blackmail letter, he must have been imbrued with utter rage.\nMaya:\nWh-What are you saying!? Imbrued with rage...?\nGodot:\nCome on! Don't tell me you didn't know! (Changed from [Come on! Don't tell me you didn't know it!] in the original release) Ron DeLite was once an employee of KB Security... He was a professional security guard.\nPhoenix:\n(An employee of KB Security!?)\nGodot:\nIt looks like the alibi that saved him from being convicted as a thief... ...is going to be the noose that gets him hanged. Kind of an \"anti-alibi\".\nMaya:\nNo way...\nGodot:\nHe can't be the thief because he was at the murder scene when the murder occurred!\nDesirée:\nN-No! Th-That's a lie! It can't be true!\nRon:\nOh! Ohhhh! B-But I... I am a thief I tell you!\nGodot:\nRon DeLite. You're going back to prison again. This time the charge is much more serious. This time you'll be tried for murder.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!? This can't... This is impossible!\nGodot:\nI'm looking forward to another exciting showdown, Mr. Trite!\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nYou and I aren't through with each other yet. Surely you won't back down from a challenge! You've never been a coward!\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Is there something personal between you two...?\nGodot:\nI've returned from the depths of Hell to do battle with you. ...At least let me have some fun while I'm here!\nPhoenix:\n(This guy... Who the heck is he!? He may be quiet... But he's the most dangerous enemy I've ever faced...)\nGodot:\nWell then... Time to say goodbye to Mr. DeLite.\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nN-Nick...!

He's probably working on the murder case.\nPhoenix:\nBut wasn't he in charge of the Mask☆DeMasque investigation all the way up to yesterday?\nMaya:\nWell, a murder case is a lot more exciting, isn't it?

M-Mr. Wright!\nMaya:\nMr. DeLite... Did they finish their interrogation?\nRon:\nYes, but...! P-Please don't leave me alone anymoooooore!\nPhoenix:\n...Mr. DeLite, you lied to us before, didn't you?\nRon:\nW-Well... Err, you see...\nPhoenix:\nOn the same night the Sacred Urn was stolen from Lordly Tailor Department Store... ...a blackmail letter you got summoned you to KB Security to hand over some money. And then, that's where the CEO, Kane Bullard, was murdered. But... there's only one Ron DeLite, am I right? So the only question is... Where were you that night? This time I want to hear the whole truth... Your life depends on it.\nRon:\nO-OK...\nAfter clearing \"The night of the crime\", \"Why you were fired\", and \"Heist plans\" Talk options:\nPhoenix:\nRon, before we go, there's one more thing I want to ask you.\nRon:\nY-Yes...? B-But please don't hurt me...\nPhoenix:\nMr. Kane Bullard... Do you swear that it wasn't you who killed him?\nRon:\nY-Yes, of course! I could never...! I-I'm not lying! All I did was hide his body in the safe! But then I was afraid they'd discover what I did. So I turned myself in yesterday!\nMaya:\nUm, why?\nRon:\nWell, if the judge had ruled that I was guilty of robbery, then I'd have an alibi, right?\nMaya:\nHmm... I guess so. You're really clever, Mr. DeLite.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I have no choice but to take Mr. DeLite at his word.)\n???:\nMystic Maya!\nMaya:\nHey...! Pearly!\nPearl:\nI'm back!\nPhoenix:\nHey Pearls. So what have you been up to this whole time...?\nPearl:\nThe Sacred Urn, Mr. Nick! I took it back to Kurain Village to have it examined!\nMaya:\nAnd? And? What did you find out?\nPearl:\nWell there's no need to worry! They said it's the real urn!\nMaya:\nWhew! That's a relief! I was really worried!\nPearl:\nBut there's one small problem.\nMaya:\nProblem?\nPearl:\nUm, these cute little pink splotches... They said that it's paint... And that they were put on the urn recently!\nPhoenix:\nWhy are we talking about the pink splotches again? What's the big deal?\nMaya:\nWhat's the big deal!? We've gotta find out how they got there! That's the big deal!\nPearl:\nYes, Mr. Nick! We've gotta find out how they got there!\nPhoenix:\nO-OK, OK! We'll go find out how they got there!\nRon:\nP-Please don't forget about me...\nSacred Urn refiled into the Court Record.\nOctober 13Lordly TailorBasement Warehouse\nAndrews:\nOh, Pearl. How nice to see you.\nPearl:\nH-Hello there!\nAndrews:\nI haven't seen you around lately. What have you been up to?\nPearl:\nWell, actually... I was having this urn examined!\nAndrews:\n! O-Oh... I see.\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe if we take another good look at this urn... ...we can figure out the mystery of what actually happened here...)\nMaya:\nNick! Let's look around one more time!\nPhoenix:\nThe first time that we came down here... It was on the night that the Sacred Urn was stolen.\nPearl:\nBut Mr. Nick... There were no paint marks on the walls or floor of the warehouse when we were here.\nAndrews:\nWell, there's a good reason for that. On the day of the crime, around noon... ...that golden statue just happened to arrive from the mountain training hall.\nMaya:\nA-And?\nAndrews:\nI realized that the statue would be the perfect size for covering up the paint stains. That's why... I put it where you first saw it.\nMaya:\nI see... Now it makes perfect sense.\nPearl:\nUm, but there's still one thing I find strange...\nAndrews:\nWhat is it, Pearl?\nPearl:\nThe day after the urn was stolen, we came here again... At that time, the statue had been moved and the paint was clearly visible.\nPhoenix:\n(She's right about that...) Well, Ms. Andrews?\nAndrews:\nHuh! What? I, err... I don't know anything about that! I placed it there to cover the paint, so why would I move it again?\nMaya:\nWell then who was it? Who would have done it and why...?\nPhoenix:\n(On the day before the theft, the statue was definitely closer to the door! Then the next day, it was moved. But why...?)\nAmi Fey's Golden Statue updated in the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like... ...there's some connection between the Sacred Urn and the murder case.\nMaya:\nWh-Why? Why do you think so, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nBecause that night... the real thief, Ron DeLite, was at KB Security. ...So then why did another Mask☆DeMasque show up here? A lot of different things are pointing to one undeniable fact.\nPearl:\nOne undeniable fact...?\nPhoenix:\n(The murder trial is starting tomorrow, but...

Nick!\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it this time?\nMaya:\nYou won't believe how many people are here for the trial!\nPhoenix:\nWell... It is a murder case.\nMaya:\nWhat are you talking about? They're here for the trial next door!\nPhoenix:\n\"Next door\"...?\nMaya:\nWhy don't you know this, Nick? *sigh* They're having Detective Atmey's trial today!\nPhoenix:\nDetective Atmey...?\nMaya:\nThey say they're going to try him as Mask☆DeMasque.\nPhoenix:\nAlready? That was fast...\nMaya:\nBoy, I'd love to see Mask☆DeMasque's trial.\n???:\n...I know...\nPhoenix:\nBy the way, where's Pearls?\nMaya:\nOh, she went back home. She said she can't neglect her training anymore.\n???:\n...I know you don't like me...\nPhoenix:\nPearls has really gotten into her training lately, huh?\nMaya:\nYeah... Ever since... ...that incident last year.\nRon:\nPleeeeease! Don't ignore meeee!\nMaya:\n...Oh, Mr. DeLite! Good morning!\nRon:\nNo one likes me... No one would notice me, even if I killed someone...\nMaya:\nCome on, don't be silly! ... W-Wait a sec!\nPhoenix:\nYou don't mean... You're the murderer...!?\nRon:\nN-N-N-No, no! I'm just a poor thief! ... No, wait, that's not right. A thief can't really be \"poor\"\nPhoenix:\n(Now, let's see... According to Mr. DeLite... From his second crime on, he was following a bunch of set plans. Plans that someone had been sending to him to \"help\" him commit the heists.)\nMaya:\nDo you think there's a connection between the thief and the murder, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nIt's possible... But today's trial is a race against the clock.\nMaya:\nHuh? How come? Let's just take our time like always.\nPhoenix:\nI'm afraid... That's not an option.\nMaya:\n...?\nOctober 14, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 6\nJudge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Ron DeLite.\nPhoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.\nGodot:\nYou're \"ready\"? Preparation is the last refuge of the week.\nJudge:\n...OK, settle down everyone. Let's begin with your opening statement, Mr. Godot.\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh... He's got the judge in the palm of his hands... Yet again...)\nGodot:\nRon DeLite is simply too young to be sent to war. ...That's all.\nJudge:\n... I'm afraid I have no idea what that means, Mr. Godot.\nGodot:\nHa...! Then you need to get out more, Your Honor. Life is war. But that is exactly why you must be more precise in your wording. That's all my statement means. You understand now, right?\nJudge:\n...Yes. Well then, let me briefly summarize the details of this case.\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... The judge is taking charge like he knows what's going on for a change...)\nJudge:\nThe victim is Kane Bullard, CEO of KB Security. His body was found in a safe at approximately 9 AM on the morning of the 13th. However, the time of death was estimated as 1 AM of the previous day.\nGodot:\nAnd... that's when our little lost kitten dropped the ball. That little lost kitten is, of course, the defendant.\nJudge:\nVery well then, Mr. Godot. Please call your first witness.\nGodot:\nI never drink more than 17 cups of coffee during any given trial. But the first one... is always the best.\nJudge:\nUm, Mr. Godot... Your witness...?\nGodot:\n...OK, then. Let's hear what the defendant, Mr. Ron DeLite, has to say for himself.\nJudge:\nThe defendant...? Well, Mr. Wright? Does the defense have any objections? It may be a bit of a disadvantage having the defendant testify, but...\nPhoenix:\n(I remember when Mia was defending me... She allowed me to testify so she could do the cross-examination... She put a lot of trust in me back then...) We have no objections, Your Honor. The defense will allow Mr. DeLite to testify.\nGodot:\nHa...! You've got guts, Trite.\nJudge:\nAlright then, Mr. Ron DeLite, please take the stand!\nGodot:\n...You did it. Didn't you?\nRon:\nYes.\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nRon:\nUh... No no no no no no no! Th-Th-Th-That's not true!\nJudge:\n...Hmm. For a moment there I thought we'd set the record for the shortest trial ever.\nMaya:\n*sigh* Well, Mr. DeLite already looks plenty guilty with that face he's making...\nPhoenix:\nAnd once he opens his big mouth he'll probably put the last nail in his own coffin...\nGodot:\nHa...! Very well. Now then... Can you tell me something? If you didn't kill Bullard, why did you go to KB Security?\nRon:\nW-W-Well, I... That's kind of hard to say. Boy, I wish I could go home\nJudge:\nNow then, let's hear some testimony about what happened!\nWitness Testimony\n-- My Visit To KB Security --\nRon:\nThat evening, around 1 AM, I went to see Mr. Bullard in his office at KB Security.\nThe blackmail letter I got... It ordered me to go there.\nI'd been working for KB Security until a year ago, so I knew where his office was.\nJudge:\n1 AM... The exact time the murder took place.\nGodot:\nThe weak get washed away by the tides of fate... The strong drink it up. Ha...! It's bitter today, too... Just like my destiny.\nMaya:\nYou'd never know that from the way he's chugging it down.\nJudge:\nMr. Wright... Your cross-examination, if you please.\nCross Examination\n-- My Visit To KB Security --\nRon:\nThat evening, around 1 AM, I went to see Mr. Bullard in his office at KB Security.\nRon:\nThe blackmail letter I got... It ordered me to go there.\nRon:\nThe blackmail threat didn't scare me. It wasn't going to cause me trouble or anything.\nRon:\nI'd been working for KB Security until a year ago, so I knew where his office was.\nRon:\nHe fired me for selling company secrets... but Dessie doesn't know about that.\nMaya:\nHmm... There wasn't much to his testimony, was there?\nPhoenix:\nSounds like he's avoiding something... At least, that's what it sounds like to me.\nMaya:\nUh oh. I've got a bad feeling about this... We'd better be careful.\nPhoenix:\nBut if we don't find a way to make him spill the beans... ...we'll never get closer to the truth.\nMaya:\nYeah...\nPhoenix:\nMr. DeLite... What you said just now doesn't match what you told me yesterday.\nRon:\nHuh...? What doesn't?\nPhoenix:\nI think you must have been scared... Very scared. Of having a certain person find out your secret...\nRon:\n*gulp*\nJudge:\nA certain person...?\nPhoenix:\nMs. Desirée DeLite. The defendant's wife.\nRon:\nWaah! But I-I...! L-Listen to me! My Dessie! She's...!\nGodot:\n...Looks like if I just sit back and relax, the fun will end before it truly begins.\nPhoenix:\n(Grr! Godot!)\nGodot:\nYes, we know. It was all your wife's fault.\nJudge:\nWhat do you mean...?\nGodot:\nMr. DeLite stole company data to pay for his wife's spending habit, for which he was fired. Unable to face his own wife, someone used this dirty little secret to blackmail him. And that is how this murder came about!\nJudge:\nOh... Hmm...!\nPhoenix:\n(No! Everything is falling neatly into place for him!)\nRon:\nD-Don't talk about my Dessie like that... Or you'll be sooooooorry!!\nJudge:\nWell, it seems... ...that we've learned a great deal of things here, so far.\nMaya:\nWhat do you think, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI didn't think it was possible to get so thoroughly whipped in just 20 minutes...\nJudge:\nClearly there was sufficient motive for murder. He stole data for his wife, and he killed to protect his secret... A family man who cared just a little too much.\nGodot:\nThe motive is clear. Let's move on.\nPhoenix:\nUgggh...\nGodot:\nWhat happened at the crime scene at 1 in the morning, Mr. DeLite? Come now! Tell us! We're all ears.\nWitness Testimony\n-- At the CEO's Office --\nRon:\nWhen I entered the office, there was a suspicious shadow there...\nSuddenly, I was hit on the forehead. After that, I remember being a bit dazed.\nIf I hadn't been wearing that, I would have been killed!\nWhen I came to... Mr. Bullard was lying there... dead!\nJudge:\nI see... Suddenly hit on the forehead, huh? I believe the detective from yesterday provided similar testimony. He said that Mask☆DeMasque struck him on the head from behind.\nPhoenix:\n(Of course, since Atmey turned out to be the culprit himself, that was all a lie.)\nGodot:\nHa...! No one's going to believe a pathetic lie like that.\nRon:\nWh-What are you saying!? I really was attacked!\nJudge:\nWe'll find out if what you say is true or not during the cross-examination.\nGodot:\nGot that, Mr. Trite? Don't go easy just because he's your client. If I see any sign that you are, I'll treat you to another cup of my special blend!\nPhoenix:\nYou don't need to worry about that, Mr. Godot... (I have faith in Ron... I know he didn't do it...!)\nCross Examination\n-- At the CEO's Office --\nRon:\nWhen I entered the office, there was a suspicious shadow there...\nRon:\nSuddenly, I was hit on the forehead. After that, I remember being a bit dazed.\nRon:\nIf I hadn't been wearing that, I would have been killed!\nRon:\nI'd have been killed if I hadn't been wearing my Mask☆DeMasque costume!\nRon:\nWhen I came to... Mr. Bullard was lying there... dead!\nRon:\nI panicked and hid the body in the safe. It took about 10 minutes.\nMaya:\nWe heard this from Mr. DeLite yesterday, didn't we?\nPhoenix:\nThere's not much in this testimony either.\nMaya:\nI betcha he's still hiding something.\nPhoenix:\nI wouldn't be surprised. We'll just have to draw it out of him.\nMaya:\nI just hope he doesn't make things any more complicated...\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor, could you please take a look at this record?\nJudge:\nAnd what might this be?\nPhoenix:\nThe record for the emergency buzzer that connects the CEO's office to security. If the button in the office is pressed, a security team is supposed to come running...\nGodot:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAnd according to this record, the buzzer was pushed once, at 1:02 AM!\nJudge:\nWh... Whaaat?\nPhoenix:\nIf Mr. Ron DeLite truly was the murderer... ...he would have ran as soon as that buzzer sounded! After all, a security guard would've been heading his way!\nGodot:\nGodot:\nHa...! Let's remember who we're dealing with here. He probably had no idea there were security personnel in the building!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nUp until one year ago, my client was working as a chief of security! There's no way he wouldn't have known about them!\nGodot:\nGodot:\nBut! As it turns out, the guard never came.\nPhoenix:\nThat was nothing more than a coincidence! The fact that the guard was a pathetic loser... ...who had just gotten punched in the face by his ex's new boyfriend... ...and wasn't anywhere in the vicinity was not something Mr. DeLite could have known!\nGodot:\nGodot:\nHa...! Again, remember who we're dealing with here. It's a sure bet that Mr. DeLite didn't even notice the buzzer going off!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThis buzzer is extremely loud. There is no way he could've ignored something like that! IF he had been conscious, that is.\nJudge:\n\"Conscious\"...? What do you mean by that!?\nGodot:\n... Ugh...! Fine. Let's hear your theory.\nPhoenix:\nRemember the defendant's testimony. The moment he entered the victim's office, someone attacked him... Mr. DeLite said he felt \"dazed\"... I'm willing to wager that he was knocked unconscious for at least a few minutes.\nJudge:\nUnconscious...? So he fainted!?\nPhoenix:\nThat's why Mr. DeLite didn't know that the buzzer had sounded. And that's why... he thought he had time to hide the body!\nGodot:\nS-So what are you trying to say...!?\nPhoenix:\nMr. DeLite was knocked out, and the buzzer went off soon afterwards... Now, unless my client was able to hit the buzzer while he was unconscious... It can only mean that there was another person in that room! That's right! Whoever it was knocked out Ron DeLite and then pressed the buzzer!\nJudge:\nO-Order in the court! Mr. Wright! This... This is...!\nGodot:\nGodot:\nTh-This is preposterous! It was this kid... ...Ron DeLite, is the one who killed Kane Bullard!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThen who pressed the buzzer?\nGodot:\nI-It was... The victim, of course! He pressed the buzzer when the defendant attacked him! He didn't die right away! He must have held on long enough to push that button!\nPhoenix:\nACK!!\nJudge:\nHmmm... So Kane Bullard sounded the buzzer himself... What is your opinion on this, Mr. Wright!?\nPhoenix:\n(I need to prove that the real criminal was there at the scene! But how? Can I prove that it wasn't Kane Bullard who sounded the buzzer?)\nPhoenix:\nThe defense's opinion is this, Your Honor! This piece of evidence proves that it wasn't the victim who sounded the buzzer!\nPhoenix:\nI believe this is the piece of incontrovertible evidence you were looking for!\nJudge:\nTh-The emergency buzzer...? Is there some kind of clue on it?\nPhoenix:\nAbsolutely not.\nGodot:\nHey, come on now... At least give some thought to what you say before opening your mouth.\nPhoenix:\nThe fact that there are absolutely no clues... is itself the clue.\nJudge:\nNow I'm the one who's clueless!\nPhoenix:\nThis button has no fingerprints on it. If Mr. Bullard had really pressed it himself... ...naturally, he would have left his fingerprints behind!\nGodot:\nPhwoooooooooooh!!\nGodot:\nGodot:\nR...Ron DeLite... obviously wiped them off!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWhy would he? A guard could have come in at any moment!\nGodot:\nHe touched that button! I know he did!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThe defendant, Mr. DeLite, was dressed as Mask☆DeMasque. And Mask☆DeMasque... always wears gloves! What reason could he possibly have had to wipe the button free of fingerprints!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order!\nGodot:\nHa...! It would seem... I've been forced to eat crow!\nMaya:\nI wonder what blend number crow-flavored coffee is?\nJudge:\nHowever, if the real killer was there at the scene... ...why would that person press the emergency buzzer?\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\nShouldn't they have run away without putting themselves in extra danger?\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\n......\nPhoenix:\n.........\nJudge:\nWhat's with this awkward silence all of a sudden!?\nGodot:\nHa...! It looks like you're fresh out of parlor tricks.\nMaya:\nThey're on to you, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nJ-Just give me a minute to collect my thoughts...! The real culprit killed Mr. Bullard at around 1 AM.\nMaya:\nAnd Mr. DeLite just happened to waltz in when the murder was taking place, right?\nPhoenix:\nThe killer clobbered Mr. DeLite, and then sounded the buzzer.\nMaya:\nEven though security was supposed to respond right away if the buzzer was pressed.\nPhoenix:\n(\"Security was supposed to respond\"? Hmm...)\nJudge:\n...Time's up, Mr. Wright. Let's hear what you have to say.\nPhoenix:\nVery well then...\nGodot:\nOh ho... You've got some guts. I like that in an opponent.\nJudge:\nWhy did the \"real killer\" sound the emergency buzzer?\nPhoenix:\nThe killer knew that if they pressed that button, a guard would come running. And that was exactly what they wanted.\nJudge:\nD-Do you mean to say the killer called the guard on purpose!?\nPhoenix:\nYes... Although as it turned out, he never showed up.\nMaya:\nBecause he was getting his clock cleaned at the time...\nGodot:\nHa...! What a touching story! You're saying the killer had a change of heart and called the guard to turn himself in?\nPhoenix:\nNo, I'm not. When that buzzer sounded, there were three people in that office. The victim, Kane Bullard, who was already dead. The defendant, Ron DeLite, who was out cold. And... The third person. The real killer.\nJudge:\n...Hypothetically, yes.\nPhoenix:\nNow then... In this situation, if the real killer made an escape, what would happen? The only ones left in the room would be the victim, and Ron DeLite...\nRon:\nAnd... And if any security guards came running in at that time... They would think that I was the murderer!\nPhoenix:\nYes! That was precisely the real killer's objective. To frame Ron DeLite for the murder!\nGodot:\nPhwooooooooooh!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order!\nGodot:\nHa...! It would seem... I've been made to eat my words once again!\nMaya:\nActually you've been made to do a spit-take... with a cup of coffee.\nRon:\nM-Mr. Wright! Who was it!? Who was it that tried to frame me!? Err... Wait. Wait a second... I'm the one and only Mask☆DeMasque, so\nMaya:\nNick! You mean the real killer is...!?\nPhoenix:\nWe're going to drag that person in here right now!\nMaya:\nBut, but! Who is it?\nPhoenix:\nI don't have any solid proof yet... but think about it. The killer knew Mr. DeLite's identity. And they also knew... ...that he had been called to KB Security that night... So, the killer used him to execute a well-crafted plan to murder Kane Bullard!\nJudge:\nHmm, now then. Let's hear your accusation, Mr. Wright. Who was it framed Mr. Ron DeLite for the murder of Kane Bullard!?\nPhoenix:\nDetective Luke Atmey... He's the only one who could have done it.\nGodot:\nAce Detective...\nRon:\nLuke Atmey...\nJudge:\nYou mean... Mask☆DeMasque did it...?\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor, the person being tried in the court next to us... ...is not Mask☆DeMasque at all. He is, in actuality... the true murderer of Kane Bullard!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order!! M-Mr. Wright! Explain yourself!\nPhoenix:\nTheft and murder... Which is the more serious crime?\nJudge:\nThey're not even close. Murder is the more serious crime, of course! It's a capital crime subject to a capital punishment.\nPhoenix:\nPlease remember the trial from yesterday, if you would. When Luke Atmey confessed, there was a huge commotion in the courtroom.\nGodot:\nOf course. A famous detective was unmasked as... well, as Mask☆DeMasque.\nPhoenix:\nInstead of being convicted of murder, he was found guilty of grand larceny. ...That was his true objective all along.\nJudge:\nTo be found \"guilty\"...\nPhoenix:\nMask☆DeMasque had the perfect alibi for when the murder took place. He was stealing the urn at Lordly Tailor. ...In other words! Being found guilty as Mask☆DeMasque... ...was Luke Atmey's airtight, watertight, and unassailable alibi.\nJudge:\nA guilty verdict... AS AN ALIBI!?\nGodot:\nYou know... It's almost time.\nJudge:\nF-For what?\nGodot:\nFor Luke Atmey's verdict. It was a pretty simple trial, after all. If we're going to stop this trial and stall that one, we need to do it now. Of course... That's assuming you have proof that the detective was the one who committed the murder.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nJudge:\nMr. Luke Atmey's trial has indeed attracted the attention of the entire country. If we were to intrude, and failed to provide adequate proof of his true crime...  Mr. DeLite would be left with no grounds for appeal.\nPhoenix:\n... (Am I really sure about this...?)\nGodot:\nHa...! A bet's only good when your life's the ante.\nRon:\nMr. Wright! I... I believe in you!\nPhoenix:\nMr. DeLite...\nRon:\nSo... So... Please. I'M BEGGING YOOOOOOU!!\nPhoenix:\n(Thanks... But... My decision will determine the rest of your life! Can I really risk your life like this...?)\n...Phoenix...\nPhoenix:\n...! (Wh-What was that...?)\n...Don't stray Phoenix......For your client... Take the path of trust...\nPhoenix:\n(Th-That voice... It-It sounds like... M-Mia...!) Your Honor! The defense requests an immediate recess!\nGodot:\nHa...! So that's your answer, huh?\nJudge:\nVery well. I've decided as well. This court will now take a 20 minute recess. ...Mr. Wright. When we return, please summon Mr. Luke Atmey to the stand!\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor!\nOctober 14, 11:58 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 5\nPayne:\nHee hee hee hee... Well, Sir Detective Atmey!?\nAtmey:\nHeh... Heh heh heh... I have to say, Mr. Payne. You performed splendidly.\nPayne:\nOh no, Sir Detective Atmey. You were the one who...\nJudge:\nThat's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. This court finds the defendant, Luke Atmey...\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWait! Don't hand down your verdict yet! Please!\nAtmey:\nWell well... Sir Lawyer. Welcome to my courtroom...\nJudge:\nWho's this hoser, eh!?\nPhoenix:\nMy name is Phoenix Wright, attorney at law. And I wish to file an accusation against this man, Luke Atmey!\nPayne:\nAc-Accusation? You accuse Mask☆DeMasque--\nPhoenix:\nThat man is not Mask☆DeMasque. He's just a ruthless murderer!\nJudge:\nWH-WHAAAAAAAAAAT!?\nAtmey:\n............\nTo be continued.\nOctober 14, 12:14 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 4\nMaya:\n...My sis?\nPhoenix:\nI could have sworn I heard Mia's voice.\nMaya:\nSo then, she's still alive... inside your heart.\nDesirée:\n...Nicky boy!\nPhoenix:\nOh, Ms. DeLite...\nDesirée:\nIs it true that detective is the real killer?\nPhoenix:\nTo be honest... we don't have any definite proof. But he's the only one who could have done it.\nDesirée:\nBut, wasn't he at Lordly Tailor that night?\nMaya:\nNot to mention, we don't exactly know his motive. I mean, why would Detective Atmey want to kill Kane Bullard...?\nPhoenix:\n... Oops, it's almost time! Better get back to the courtroom. (I need to find some solid proof... and it's gotta happen sooner rather than later!)\nOctober 14, 12:21 PM\nDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 6\nJudge:\nNow then, this court is back in session. Mr. Luke Atmey. Please take the stand.\nAtmey:\nWell well... How do you do, Sir Lawyer? I never would have thought to see you acting so recklessly.\nPhoenix:\nI couldn't let them hand down your verdict just yet. Not when it would have given you your perfect alibi. An alibi by the name of \"Mask☆DeMasque\"...\nAtmey:\nI'm sorry. I'm afraid even the great Luke Atmey has no idea what you mean. Of course, I have been in the next courtroom ever since 10 o'clock this morning. ...I'm afraid there's no way I could know what's been going on in here.\nJudge:\nYou've been in the defendant's seat all day long, correct? Being tried as Mask☆DeMasque...\nAtmey:\nIndeed... It's truly child's play to fool the ignorant masses. Not only did the poor fools ask me to \"protect\" their valuables... ...they even gave me a generous reward upon returning their own property to them. Take this red diamond ring that sparkles upon my divine finger, for example...\nPhoenix:\nSo you continue to insist that you are, in fact, \"Mask☆DeMasque\"?\nAtmey:\n...Of course.\nJudge:\nVery well then, Luke Atmey. Let us begin with this simple question. On October 12th at 1 AM. Kane Bullard was murdered. Where were you at that time?\nAtmey:\nOne without knowledge lacks even the knowledge that he should be ashamed of himself. ...But don't worry. I will not hold it against you, Sir Judge.\nJudge:\nUm, thanks...\nGodot:\nAlright, Mr. Atmey... The night of the murder... Speak! ...We're all ears! (Changed from [...We're listening!] in the original release)\nAtmey:\nAs you wish... Sir Prosecutor.\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Alibi --\nAtmey:\nI was stealing the urn as Mask☆DeMasque, just as I announced I would...\nI had more than enough time to prepare. It was a pathetically easy job.\nA photograph contains no words... But in this case, one turned out to be my witness.\nThe time at which the camera captured Mask☆DeMasque was the same time as the murder!\nJudge:\nHmm... It seems the main point of discussion will be this photo of the crime scene.\nPhoenix:\n(Everything else up until now was all part of his plan. There has to be a secret to this picture as well!)\nAtmey:\nEven the great Mask☆DeMasque cannot be in two places at once. Now then, if you'll excuse me. I have a verdict to receive.\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nUnfortunately, Mr. Atmey, we still have to do your cross-examination.\nAtmey:\n...A fool is too foolish to know that he is a fool...\nMaya:\nI think he's trying to say that you're full of it, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nThe only thing that's full of it is his alibi!\nCross Examination\n-- The Alibi --\nAtmey:\nI was stealing the urn as Mask☆DeMasque, just as I announced I would...\nAtmey:\nI had more than enough time to prepare. It was a pathetically easy job.\nAtmey:\nA photograph contains no words... But in this case, one turned out to be my witness.\nAtmey:\nThe time at which the camera captured Mask☆DeMasque was the same time as the murder!\nMaya:\nSo, this alibi is false?\nPhoenix:\nIt has to be, or he couldn't have killed Mr. Bullard at KB Security.\nMaya:\nBut... I'm not really spotting anything unusual.\nPhoenix:\nThere are two possibilities... Either the Mask☆DeMasque in the photo is a fake... Or the photo itself is.\nPhoenix:\nThe supervisor of the Treasure Exhibit stated the following.\nAndrews:\nWell, there's a good reason for that. On the day of the crime, around noon... ...that golden statue just happened to arrive from the mountain training hall.\nAndrews:\nI realized that the statue would be the perfect size for covering up the paint stains. That's why... I put it where you first saw it.\nPhoenix:\nI myself was there the night the theft took place, and saw the statue in that spot. If this picture was truly taken on that night, then that statue should've been there!\nGodot:\nGodot:\nBut when I went there the day after the theft... ...that statue of the old bag was sitting in the corner.\nJudge:\nHmmm... Perhaps it was somehow pushed there accidentally...?\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor, this statue is slightly larger than yourself and quite heavy. It would take more than an accidental push to move it that distance!\nGodot:\nHa...! In that case... Can you prove it? Can you give us the \"rhyme and reason\" as to why that statue was moved that night?\nMaya:\nC-Can you do it, Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Never mind who moved it... The real question is \"why did they move it\"...)\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Wright. I hope you are prepared with your answer. Now then, who was the one that moved the golden statue on the night of the crime?\nPhoenix:\nThe one who moved the statue is none other than... Luke Atmey!\nAtmey:\nCome now, Sir Lawyer! There you go again on one of your strange delusions...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! What basis do you have for your strange delusions!?\nPhoenix:\n...It's very simple. The witness was the only one in the basement warehouse that night.\nAtmey:\nThat is indeed very simple... However! Why would I want to move a heavy golden statue?\nPhoenix:\n(The reason for moving the golden statue... Here's where our battle really begins.)\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? What reason did the witness have to move that statue!?\nPhoenix:\nThe reason can be found here in this photograph.\nAtmey:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nLuke Atmey, You pretended to be Mask☆DeMasque... ...to create an alibi by showing you were \"at Lordly Tailor that night\".\nAtmey:\n...\nPhoenix:\nBut this photograph contains a single, fatal flaw. If the statue had been there, your lie would be exposed like cheap film at a drug store... That is why you had to move the statue! (Changed from [That is why you moved the statue!] in the original release)\nJudge:\nA single, fatal flaw? ([flaw] highlighted in the original release)\nGodot:\nInteresting theory... Please enlighten us. Just where in this picture does this \"lie\" exist!?\nPhoenix:\nNaturally... the lie in this photo is the timestamp!\nJudge:\nWh-What do you mean!?\nPhoenix:\nI'll tell you exactly what I mean! On the night in question, Luke Atmey went to KB Security and murdered Kane Bullard! Therefore, it's obvious! It would have been impossible for him to have been at Lordly Tailor at this time!\nAtmey:\n...!\nJudge:\nBut what does that have to do with the statue being moved...?\nPhoenix:\nRemember if you will, Your Honor. When was this statue placed besides the warehouse door...?\nJudge:\nW-Well...\nGodot:\nThe statue was taken down to the warehouse on the day of the crime... ...and it was placed there in order to cover up the paint.\nPhoenix:\n...Exactly. Luke Atmey had already decided on the time when he was going to kill the victim. And so, in order to create an alibi for that time... ...he took this picture days before the murder took place!\nGodot:\nWh-What the...!?\nPhoenix:\nOf course, the statue hadn't yet been brought down to the basement warehouse yet.\nJudge:\nAh...\nPhoenix:\nSo, on the day of the crime, Mr. Atmey must have been quite nervous! As nervous as a long-tailed cat in a rocking chair factory, so to speak. Why? Because something that wasn't supposed to be there... ...had been brought down and placed where it wasn't supposed to be. And that... ...is why Luke Atmey had to move the statue on the night of the murder! He did it to make the room match with the way it had been in his photo!\nAtmey:\n... GWAAAAAAAH!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Mr. Atmey! Is this true!?\nAtmey:\nOne moment, Your Honor! H-Have you forgotten this?\nJudge:\nWh-What's that...?\nAtmey:\nThe data for the basement warehouse computer! According to this, the camera did indeed go off on the night of the crime!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nIt's true that the camera had been set up by the Lordly Tailor staff. However! The program used to manage that data was yours! That alone would have allowed you to tamper with the data!\nAtmey:\nAh... AAAAAAAAAAAHHH!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Mr. Godot! What is the meaning of this!? Godot! I warned you about making me wait! Now put that coffee down!\nGodot:\n...My 11th cup. I've promised to drink no more than 17 during a trial. Which means... I'm still good 'til the last drop.\nJudge:\nHowever, the defense has a very good point!\nGodot:\n\"A good point\"...? So what? We are all but travelers on a road of infinite points.\nMaya:\nUm, I think he's got his \"points\" mixed up with his other \"points\"... (Changed from [Um, I think you've got your 'points' mixed up with your other 'points'...] in the original release)\nGodot:\n...So you say this photograph was taken ahead of time. And that the statue was moved in order to make it match... That's a very interesting idea. However. There's one point that can't be denied.\nPhoenix:\nWhich is...?\nGodot:\nThat it's only... a \"possibility\". Men that are trapped by the chains of \"maybe\"... ...can never reach their dreams!\nJudge:\nTh-That's very true!\nPhoenix:\nN-No way! Don't fall for that, Your Honor!\nGodot:\nHey! Mr. DeMasque!\nAtmey:\nY-Yes!?\nGodot:\nIf there's no funny business in your actions as Mask☆DeMasque... ...there should be no problem with you telling us your strategy. So let's hear it.\nJudge:\nYes. Please provide this court with your testimony. About your plan to steal the Sacred Urn!\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Sacred Urn Heist --\nAtmey:\nI first received the request from Lordly Tailor about 20 days ago.\nThe urn was placed in a box, and Zvarri! It was then sent to the warehouse.\nHence, I was actually unable to see the urn for myself until the day of the crime...\nI knew it was an extremely valuable treasure, so I sent my card 10 days beforehand.\nI then handled security by myself to ensure that my crime would go smoothly!\nAt last, I held the urn in my hands for the first time at 1 AM on October 12th.\nMaya:\nThat's pretty much all stuff we've heard before, isn't it?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, but we will find the truth hidden in the nuggets of new information he gave.\nJudge:\nWitness... You're sure there are no mistakes this time?\nAtmey:\n...Zvarri.\nJudge:\nVery well then! Mr. Wright! You may begin your cross-examination!\nCross Examination\n-- The Sacred Urn Heist --\nAtmey:\nI first received the request from Lordly Tailor about 20 days ago.\nAtmey:\nThe urn was placed in a box, and Zvarri! It was then sent to the warehouse.\nAtmey:\nHence, I was actually unable to see the urn for myself until the day of the crime...\nAtmey:\nI knew it was an extremely valuable treasure, so I sent my card 10 days beforehand.\nAtmey:\nI then handled security by myself to ensure that my crime would go smoothly!\nAtmey:\nAt last, I held the urn in my hands for the first time at 1 AM on October 12th.\nMaya:\nHmmm... Not a lot to go on, is there?\nPhoenix:\nThat detective's been covering his tracks... There's only one thing we need to prove in this cross-examination...! That he took this photo well before the actual night of the crime.\nMaya:\nAlright then... How do we do that?\nPhoenix:\nThere's one thing that Atmey stated very clearly. That he had never seen the urn before he stole it...\nMaya:\nWe need to prove that he's lying...\nPhoenix:\nMr. Atmey... If you really are Mask☆DeMasque... ...then you also wrote this calling card, correct?\nAtmey:\nBut of course.\nGodot:\nIs there a problem with that calling card?\nPhoenix:\nAllow me to read a passage from the calling card that Mask☆DeMasque had written. \"Take good care of the speckled urn.\" Now, the \"speckled\" here... ...surely refers to this pink pattern on the Sacred Urn.\nJudge:\nYes, that is true... But so what?\nPhoenix:\nTruth be told, there is no way that Mask☆DeMasque could have known about this pattern.\nAtmey:\nWhat do you mean...?\nPhoenix:\nThis pink, spotted pattern on the urn... is actually nothing more than paint stains.\nJudge:\nPaint stains...?\nPhoenix:\nAnd these stains did not appear... ...until after the urn had been taken to Lordly Tailor!\nAtmey:\nHhhmph...!\nGodot:\nI'm not finding this joke to be very funny, Mr. Trite!\nPhoenix:\nThe day that the Sacred Urn was taken to the warehouse... ...the urn was broken due to human error, or should I say an error-prone human. And that's when the pink paint got on the urn!\nGodot:\nUrghh...! Y-You can't be serious...!\nPhoenix:\nAnd yet this \"calling card\" clearly mentions the paint pattern. Which means... Detective Atmey had seen this urn long before the crime ever took place! In fact, he saw it when this fake photo was taken!\nGodot:\n...Phwoooooh!\nPhoenix:\nAnd because this photo is a fake... ...your alibi for the night of the murder no longer holds water!\nAtmey:\nGwagwagwagwawaaaah!\nJudge:\n...Witness. Do you have anything to say for yourself?\nAtmey:\nGrr... Mmm... Nnn...\nPhoenix:\n(Alright! That did it! He's broken!)\nMaya:\nUm, Nick, I think it's still a little early for a victory pose.\nPhoenix:\n...Huh?\nGodot:\nHa...! It's so sad... No one has any conviction these days...\nJudge:\nC-Conviction... you say?\nGodot:\nYesterday, we all decided unanimously that this man was Mask☆DeMasque. And now, we're calling him a murderer... You don't think we're being a tad fickle?\nJudge:\nTh-That's a good point!\nPhoenix:\nN-No way! Don't fall for that too, Your Honor!\nGodot:\nYou say that Luke Atmey was the one who killed Kane Bullard? Then let me ask you this. Why would he do that?\nAtmey:\nHeh heh heh heh heh... An excellent point.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nAtmey:\nMotive, Mr. Wright! Motive! Might you my merry murderous motive manifest?\nMaya:\nN-Nick! He's getting his second wind!\nJudge:\nIf he prepared an alibi and pinned his crime on Ron DeLite as you say... ...he must have had a very strong motive for murder!\nGodot:\nThe only one with any motive we've seen is Ron DeLite. Isn't that right, Detective!?\nAtmey:\nIndeed. According to my own research, the boy's motive is clear!\nJudge:\nWithout a motive, it's nearly impossible to prove guilt in a murder case! Now then... Maybe you can enlighten us to what the defendant's motives were.\nAtmey:\nI'd be honored to, Sir Old-Timer. (Changed from [Thank you, Sir Old-timer.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(They're doing everything they can to make Ron look suspicious... Despite our lack of hard information, this may be our only chance...)\nWitness Testimony\n-- Motive for Murder --\nAtmey:\nI, Luke Atmey, had no points of contact with the victim whatsoever.\nKane Bullard decided to investigate Mask☆DeMasque and simply mistook who he was!\nIt was Mr. Bullard who wrote the blackmail letter and sent it to Ron DeLite.\nAnd it was again Mr. Bullard who harbored a grudge against Mr. DeLite for his betrayal!\nMr. Bullard's mistake is quite excusable. The defendant truly believes he is Mask☆DeMasque.\nThat is why Mr. DeLite saw it fit to kill Kane Bullard. Truly a tragedy...\nJudge:\nSo the victim, Kane Bullard, blackmailed the defendant...?\nGodot:\nThis is the blackmail letter found in the defendant's apartment. A handwriting test confirms that Mr. Bullard was indeed the one who wrote the letter.\nPhoenix:\n(Wh-What!?)\nBlackmail Letter updated in the Court Record.\nJudge:\nVery well, Mr. Wright. Begin your cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- Motive for Murder --\nAtmey:\nI, Luke Atmey, had no points of contact with the victim whatsoever.\nAtmey:\nKane Bullard decided to investigate Mask☆DeMasque and simply mistook who he was!\nAtmey:\nIt was Mr. Bullard who wrote the blackmail letter and sent it to Ron DeLite.\nAtmey:\nAnd it was again Mr. Bullard who harbored a grudge against Mr. DeLite for his betrayal!\nAtmey:\nMr. Bullard's mistake is quite excusable. The defendant truly believes he is Mask☆DeMasque.\nAtmey:\nThat is why Mr. DeLite saw it fit to kill Kane Bullard. Truly a tragedy...\nMaya:\nSo you're going to try to connect Detective Atmey to Mr. Bullard, right?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, that's right. Hopefully it won't require surgery either...\nMaya:\nIn that case, you'll have to talk about the blackmail...\nPhoenix:\nThat's true. (Was that blackmail letter really intended for Ron?)\nMaya:\nSince we don't have enough information, you should press him for more testimony!\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe I'll able to shake some contradictions loose that way!)\nPhoenix:\nTake a good look at this newspaper clipping. It contains a picture of the \"Tear of Emanon\", the stolen jewel.\nJudge:\nWh-What about it?\nPhoenix:\nThe problem is this jewel's color.\nGodot:\nColor...? I'm not much for discussing color myself...\nPhoenix:\nAccording to the clipping, the color of the stolen jewel was \"blue\". However, in the blackmail letter, a totally different jewel is mentioned. \"I'll take that red diamond you received the other day.\"\nJudge:\nR-Red...!?\nPhoenix:\nWhich means! The \"red diamond\" described in the blackmail letter... ...is not the \"Tear of Emanon\" that Mask☆DeMasque stole at all!\nGodot:\nGodot:\nAnd your point is, Mr. Trite!? So you are trying to say that this blackmail letter was intended for someone else. ...That is what you're trying to say!? Right, Trite?\nJudge:\nThat is what you're trying to say!? Right, Mr. Wright?\nMaya:\nWell? That is what you're trying to say!? Right, Nick!?\nPhoenix:\n...Yes. This is who Kane Bullard was actually blackmailing!\nPhoenix:\nNaturally... It was you, Detective Atmey!\nAtmey:\n... Do you have some sort of basis for that claim?\nPhoenix:\nYou have been personally involved in every single Mask☆DeMasque case. And in the last case, you \"recovered\" what was stolen... ...and received a \"jewel\"... ...as your reward.\nGodot:\nA-A jewel...?\nPhoenix:\nProbably the one wrapped conspicuously around your finger. That red diamond ring!\nAtmey:\nUnn... Ggg...!\nPhoenix:\nThat is the diamond referred to in the letter! Which means that Kane Bullard wrote that letter in order to blackmail YOU!\nAtmey:\nAaaaahhhhh!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Um, um... Order, I say...\nGodot:\nGodot:\nIt seems... You've gone too far with your childish pranks, Mr. Trite.\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh... I don't like the way he said that...)\nGodot:\nKane Bullard blackmailing Luke Atmey? Are you for real?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes. I am.\nMaya:\nNick! Come on, stand up to him!\nGodot:\nThen answer me this! The blackmail letter contains the following passage. \"If you don't want your identity revealed to the world\"...!\nJudge:\nYes, it certainly does.\nGodot:\nKane Bullard threatened to make Luke Atmey's \"identity\" public knowledge! An \"identity\" he wanted to keep a secret. So just what was that identity!?\nPhoenix:\n(Atmey killed Kane Bullard because he was afraid of his secret becoming known...! What was the \"identity\" he wanted to keep secret...?)\nMaya:\nThis is what it all comes down to, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nThe \"identity\" that Luke Atmey wanted to so desperately keep secret was his identity as...\nPhoenix:\nLuke Atmey... was a blackmailer!\nAtmey:\n...!\nGodot:\nGodot:\nHey now... Isn't that a little different from what you've been saying? You said that Kane Bullard was the one blackmailing Luke Atmey. Are you saying that Atmey was blackmailing someone else on top of that?\nMaya:\nUgh... You have to admit, that does sound a little odd...\nPhoenix:\nIt's not odd. ...It's the only thing that makes any sense. Kane Bullard was blackmailing Luke Atmey. But! Ron DeLite was also being blackmailed by a certain someone!\nPhoenix:\nSo did you start to receive blackmail letters starting after this incident...?\nRon:\nYes. Just a few days after the \"Tear of Emanon\" heist...\nRon:\nAfter that, I started getting the plans in the mail. I received plans from some very kind person! Incredibly detailed plans!\nJudge:\n\"Detailed plans\"... In which case, that would mean that Ron DeLite was actually Mask☆DeMasque...\nPhoenix:\nThat is what we are claiming. Someone else came up with the plans, and had Mr. DeLite steal his targets for him. And that someone... was none other than Luke Atmey!\nAtmey:\nSHHH! SILENCE! ... Hee hee hee hee hee... Now I see. It's all becoming clear.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What is?\nAtmey:\nWhen you were in grade school, you received the same report card every year. \"Careless, with the tendency to jump to conclusions\"... Am I wrong?\nPhoenix:\nH-H-H-How did you...!?\nAtmey:\nYou say that I, Luke Atmey, was blackmailing Ron DeLite...? In which case, I would naturally know all about his relation to Mask☆DeMasque...\nPhoenix:\nWell, yes.\nAtmey:\nRon DeLite started receiving plans from his second crime onward, correct? Which means... I learned of his identity when he committed that first crime.\nJudge:\nGood point.. You certainly couldn't have blackmailed him otherwise.\nGodot:\nIn that case, let's see some hot, bitter evidence. During the first crime, how did Luke Atmey know that Ron DeLite was Mask☆DeMasque?\nPhoenix:\nI think I see it...\nAtmey:\nSee what...?\nPhoenix:\nWhen you were in grade school, you received the same report card every year. \"Gets into lots of mischief trying to be the center of attention.\"\nAtmey:\nWh-What do you mean...!?\nPhoenix:\n...This newspaper clipping. It has a picture of you and Ron DeLite on his guard uniform. It seems that Mask☆DeMasque didn't just disappear into thin air. He just took off his outfit... and hid it in a bucket.\nJudge:\nThat... That sounds far too stupid to be true.\nPhoenix:\nCorrect. With tricks like that he couldn't fool a baby, let alone an Ace Detective. And that's when you figured it out, Mr. Atmey! That's when you learned that under his mask, Mask☆DeMasque was really Ron DeLite!\nAtmey:\nGgg... Nnn... Urkk...\nWhat the... Wasn't he supposed to be Mask☆DeMasque...?\nNot only that... it looks like he wasn't even an Ace Detective!\nI can't believe it. He was just a slimy blackmailer...\nWhat a fraud! Trying to pass himself off as an Ace Detective...\nAtmey:\n............ Why you! How dare you expose me like that...!\nPhoenix:\n...\nAtmey:\nWhy I... I mean, I've never blackmailed anyone in my life...! I-I'm a famous and proud Ace Detective, and... and also Mask☆DeMasque! Why can't you understand that!?\nPhoenix:\nI'm afraid you are neither a proud thief, nor an Ace Detective. You're a blackmailer and a murderer. That is your true identity!\nAtmey:\nWh-Wh-Why YOUUUUUU! How dare you even dare toimplythatonesosmartandcapableasIcouldeverfalltosuchlowlydepths! Whynottrydoingsomethingyourselveswiththosebigmouthsofyours! You'reallfools!FoolsI say!Noneofyoucancomparetomygenius... You'realljustjealous!

It's enough to make one laugh...!\nJudge:\nIt would seem we've finally gotten to the real answer.\nMaya:\nThat was... quite a performance by Mr. Atmey...\nJudge:\nBailiff! Please prepare a cell for Mr. Atmey...\nGodot:\nGodot:\nThe hammer that strikes too fast has no time to aim.\nJudge:\nWh-What do you mean! I'm already prepared to deliver my ruling... (Changed from [Wh-What do you mean! I'm already prepared to deliver my sentence...] in the original release)\nGodot:\nAllow me to say one thing. I... will be the one to judge!\nJudge:\n...!\nMaya:\nYou don't get much more in your face than that...\nGodot:\nIt appears... that your claws weren't quite sharp enough, Mr. Trite.\nPhoenix:\nWh... What do you...!? (Changed from [Wh... Where do you...!?] in the original release)\nGodot:\nIt's true that you've proven a lot of things. ...Things like Luke Atmey was a filthy blackmailer. ...And that he wasn't at Lordly Tailor the night of the murder.\nPhoenix:\nThat's right! That's why he's the one who killed Mr. Bull--\nGodot:\nBut... There's still one thing you have yet to prove.\nJudge:\nWhat's that...?\nGodot:\nJust because he wasn't at the warehouse doesn't mean he was at the murder scene. Therefore, if you can't prove that this pitiful excuse for a man was at KB Security... ...then I don't see how a verdict can be delivered!\nPhoenix:\nNo... No waaaaaaaaaay!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order in the court! ...Well, Mr. Wright!?\nPhoenix:\n(Th-This is it... This is the final round...!) I've got to prove that Atmey was at Mr. Bullard's office on that night...\nMaya:\nB-But...! Can you really prove that?\nGodot:\nThat's long enough. Mr. Trite... I want to hear your answer.\nPhoenix:\nThat night, Luke Atmey was at KB Security, and the defense...\nPhoenix:\nI... I can't prove it.\nJudge:\nJust as I thought.\nPhoenix:\n...But! If we hear more of Detective Atmey's testimony...\nGodot:\nGodot:\nUnfortunately... That's as far as you go, Mr. Trite.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What do you mean?\nGodot:\nI won't allow for any more testimony... That's what I mean.\nPhoenix:\nWhat...?\nGodot:\nHave you forgotten? Luke Atmey is here after we interrupted his own trial. And you have failed to prove that he committed the murder! I think it's time for this witness to return to his own trial... ...and face his guilty verdict as Mask☆DeMasque.\nPhoenix:\nN-No...\nAtmey:\nWell now, Sir Lawyer! It seems that love wins out in the end after all! I am the Ace Detective as well as Mask☆DeMasque! My verdict will verify that! Just as Ron DeLite's will verify that he is the true murderer! I declare that with the full force of my Ace Detective-ness!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order in the court! That's enough deliberation over this witness!\nPhoenix:\n(I-I can't believe this...! At this rate, Ron is...)\nMaya:\nD-Don't give up now, Nick! We still have tomorrow! We can look for more evidence and...\nPhoenix:\nBy then, it'll be too late...\nMaya:\nHuh? Wh-Why!?\nGodot:\n\"Double Jeopardy\"... One of the basic rules of any court of law.\nMaya:\n\"Double Jeopardy\"...?\nJudge:\n\"Should a defendant be tried and found innocent in court... That defendant cannot be tried again for the same crime.\" This is a fundamental rule of all courts. And it applies to this witness as much as it applies to anyone else.\nGodot:\nMr. Atmey will be found guilty in a matter of minutes. Guilty as \"Mask☆DeMasque\". Which means...\nJudge:\nHe will be innocent as far as the murder of Kane Bullard is concerned.\nMaya:\nNo way...\nJudge:\nThe fact that you were unable to prove Mr. Atmey's guilt of that crime here... ...means that he will never again be tried as Kane Bullard's murderer.\nPhoenix:\nU... Uwaaaaaaaaaah!\nPhoenix:\n(Now there's nothing I can possibly do to win... Even if Ron is proclaimed to be innocent... ...the real killer, Luke Atmey, will go free.)\nJudge:\nYou have cross-examined every statement the witness has made here today. And as long as there is no more testimony... I'm afraid I have to declare that there will be no further questioning of this witness! Are there any objections? Then I hereby end the cross-examination of Luke Atmey!\n???:\n???:\nI think... I see it. Your Honor. When you were a child, this is what was on your report card every year. \"Has poor hearing, and often makes mistakes as a result.\"\nJudge:\nH-H-H-H-How did you...!?\n???:\n...Phoenix. Raise your head up high. Have you forgotten what I used to tell you? A lawyer is someone who smiles no matter how bad it gets.\nPhoenix:\n(Th-That voice... No way!)\nMia:\nLong time no see, Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\nM... Mia! (This is the true power of the Kurain Channeling Technique... I know that it's really \"Maya\" who's standing before me... But right now, she's my mentor, Mia Fey.)\nMia:\nNow... Let's do this!\nPhoenix:\nB-But...! There's nothing more we can do, Mia! Without any more testimony, I can't cross-examine...\nMia:\nNot yet... The testimony's not over yet.\nPhoenix:\nWh... What do you mean?\nMia:\nYour Honor! Just now you said something very interesting. \"You have cross-examined every statement the witness has made here today.\"\nJudge:\nY-Yes, that's true, but...\nMia:\nUnfortunately, Your Honor, you're forgetting something. Earlier, after the last cross-examination... ...this witness made a number of remarks!\nAtmey:\nWell now, Sir Lawyer! It seems that love wins out in the end after all! I am the Ace Detective as well as Mask☆DeMasque! My verdict will verify that! Just as Ron DeLite's will verify that he is the true murderer! I declare that with the full force of my Ace Detective-ness!\nJudge:\nY-Yes, but... These comments appear to have no importance whatso--\nMia:\nVery well... Then we shall prove their importance via cross-examination. At any rate! As long as the witness has made these remarks... ...we, the defense, assert our right to question them! Is that alright with you... Prosecutor?\nGodot:\n......\nJudge:\nIs something the matter? Mr. Godot...\nGodot:\n...! Ah, nothing.\nAtmey:\nOh, Sir Lawyer! It looks like you're one step too late! If you think such falsehoods will do anything to me, Luke At--\nGodot:\n...Let's hear it.\nAtmey:\nHuh...?\nGodot:\nIt's true that the witness made some \"remarks\". So then... Let's hear this last bit of cross-examination.\nAtmey:\nM-Mr. Godot! What are you...?\nJudge:\nVery well then. Mr. Luke Atmey. (Changed from [Very well then, Luke Atmey.] in the original release) I'm going to allow the defense to cross-examine your earlier remarks. (Changed from [I'll allow the defense to cross-examine your earlier remarks.] in the original release)\nMia:\nThe defense would like to hear why you declare the defendant to be the true murderer.\nJudge:\nSo please, give us one last bit of testimony!\nAtmey:\nI... Err...\nMia:\nPhoenix? This is it. This is our absolute last chance.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Chief!\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Last Testimony --\nAtmey:\nIndeed, it is true that I was not at Lordly Tailor.\nI had to leave to see about another vitally important job request.\nI had known about the date beforehand, so I had this photograph readied.\nMy brilliant deduction was what informed me that the true culprit was Ron DeLite.\nAnd thanks to the Key Card and Wallet, it was abundantly clear that he was there.\nI was also able to make a deduction from the buzzer, which only sounded once.\nThe button did not have any fingerprints on it... Why?\nThe victim would have left prints if he sounded it. Which means the killer sounded it.\nMr. DeLite was wearing his Mask☆DeMasque outfit, which is why he left no prints.\nAnd, the blackmail letter? The victim likely just mistook the color of the jewel.\nZvarri! Therefore, all the evidence points to that poor boy!\nPhoenix:\n(This testimony actually seems to hold up pretty well...)\nJudge:\nThe witness's earlier remarks do not appear to have been hastily prepared. All of his points have been explained, and none of them seem to contradict anything.\nAtmey:\n...But of course.\nJudge:\nBut... How did you know about the emergency buzzer?\nAtmey:\nThe police investigation documents went directly through me... And I always look over all the documents. It's elementary, Sir Lawyer!\nPhoenix:\nGrr...\nGodot:\nAre you going to make even more trouble for us now, Sir Lawyer...?\nJudge:\nI will not allow any of your usual shenanigans, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nWe cannot postpone Luke Atmey's trial any longer. This is... your last chance!\nPhoenix:\nH-Hang on a sec! Just one chance...!?\nGodot:\nHa...! It seems that the party's about to begin.\nMia:\n...Well, Phoenix?\nPhoenix:\nThere isn't any evidence that contradicts with that testimony!\nMia:\n...So it would seem.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What do you mean, \"So it would seem\"...?\nMia:\nListen, Phoenix. Pointing out contradictions... ...doesn't always mean you have to present evidence... does it? At any rate, this is our chance. If you can't point out a case-breaking contradiction... ...you lose. That's all there is to it.\nGodot:\n...Cup number 17. The last cup. It seems like the time has come to put an end to this trial.\nPhoenix:\n(I have to find a fatal contradiction in this testimony... And... I need to point it out without presenting evidence! Which means all I can do is find the contradictory remark and press it...!)\nMia:\nRemember! You only get one chance!\nJudge:\nVery well then, Mr. Wright. Please begin your final cross-examination!\nCross Examination\n-- The Last Testimony --\nAtmey:\nIndeed, it is true that I was not at Lordly Tailor.\nAtmey:\nI had to leave to see about another vitally important job request.\nAtmey:\nI had known about the date beforehand, so I had this photograph readied.\nAtmey:\nMy brilliant deduction was what informed me that the true culprit was Ron DeLite.\nAtmey:\nAnd thanks to the Key Card and Wallet, it was abundantly clear that he was there.\nAtmey:\nI was also able to make a deduction from the buzzer, which only sounded once.\nAtmey:\nThe button did not have any fingerprints on it... Why?\nAtmey:\nThe victim would have left prints if he sounded it. Which means the killer sounded it.\nAtmey:\nMr. DeLite was wearing his Mask☆DeMasque outfit, which is why he left no prints.\nAtmey:\nAnd, the blackmail letter? The victim likely just mistook the color of the jewel.\nAtmey:\nZvarri! Therefore, all the evidence points to that poor boy!\nPhoenix:\n(This cross-examination is the only chance I have to nail him! Somewhere there's a huge contradiction, and I've got to find it...!)\nMia:\nAs far as I can see, there is no evidence that contradicts his testimony. All you can do is press him. And you only get one shot.\nPhoenix:\nMr. Atmey. About this last remark...\nGodot:\nGodot:\n...You still don't get it, do you, Trite? This isn't the time to be pressing the witness on every little statement.\nPhoenix:\nI'm afraid you're the one who still doesn't get it, Mr. Godot.\nGodot:\nWh-What...?\nPhoenix:\nMr. Atmey. It seems you have finally admitted... ...that you were in the CEO's office, on the night of the murder.\nAtmey:\nH-How can you say that!?\nPhoenix:\nLet's review your testimony, shall we, Mr. Atmey? \"The button did not have any fingerprints on it... Why? Mr. DeLite was wearing his Mask☆DeMasque outfit.\" Is that correct?\nAtmey:\nI-Indeed! That's what I said! My deductions are absolutely foolproof...\nPhoenix:\nMore like your deductions prove that you're a fool.\nAtmey:\n...I, I'm sorry. Whatever do you mean?\nGodot:\nFor some reason, I'm starting to get really thirsty...\nPhoenix:\nWhen exactly did we learn the fact that... ...Ron DeLite was dressed as Mask☆DeMasque when he went to the scene of the crime?\nJudge:\nTh-That was... Um...\nGodot:\nIt was... just a few hours ago. Back when my sixth cup was looking at me with a cold stare.\nRon:\nHuh? Oh, did I forget to mention it before...? I'm sorry. I just never had a chance to mention it up until now...\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. The defendant had yet to tell anyone else this fact before this morning. Therefore, the only people who should know this are those who have been watching this trial.\nAtmey:\nGrr... Nrgh...\nPhoenix:\nDo you understand now, Detective Atmey? There is no way that you should have known about that!\nAtmey:\nAh... AAAAYEEEEHHH!!!\nPhoenix:\nYou were in the next courtroom, being tried as Mask☆DeMasque! So then, enlighten us! Just how did you know about that piece of information!?\nAtmey:\nUrk...! W-Well...\nGodot:\nGodot:\nC-Come on! This detective must have known about it! He probably had plenty of chances to find out beforehand!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAnd it's those \"chances\" that I want to discuss next! That night, \"Mr. DeLite was wearing his Mask☆DeMasque outfit.\" There is one, and only one way... ...for Detective Atmey to have found that out.\nJudge:\nOnly one...\nGodot:\n...One way, you say!?\nPhoenix:\nPlease recall, if you will, Mr. DeLite's testimony! (Changed from [Please remember, if you will, Mr. DeLite's testimony!] in the original release)\nRon:\nWhen I entered the office, there was a suspicious shadow there...\nPhoenix:\nFor a second, my client witnessed the real killer.\nGodot:\nGodot:\nBut Mr. DeLite never saw his attacker! (Changed from [But Mr. DeLite never saw him!] in the original release) So there's no way to tell whether or not the \"real killer\" was Luke Atmey... (Changed from [There's no way to tell whether or not the 'real killer' was Luke Atmey...] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nIt's with that statement that I'll turn this case on its head!\nGodot:\nJ-Just what are you implying!?\nPhoenix:\n\"Mr. DeLite saw the real killer,\" correct? Now, if you turn that statement around... ...it stands to follow that the real killer had also \"seen\" Ron DeLite!\nGodot:\nI-Impossible...\nPhoenix:\nDetective Atmey, you saw Mask☆DeMasque at the murder scene that night! You saw him when you killed Kane Bullard and assaulted Ron DeLite! That was the only way you could have known what Ron was wearing!\nAtmey:\nHee hee hee ha ha ha Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ho ho ho hee hee hee! Take a good look, everyone! Unable to find a rival worthy of my genius, I was forced to create one by myself! Here I am! The tragic clown...\nJudge:\n...That's the same line you gave yesterday.\nPhoenix:\nBut... I think there's a little more meaning behind it this time.\nAtmey:\nHee hee hee ha ha ha Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ho ho ho hee hee hee!\nJudge:\nWhat an awfully complicated incident... Kane Bullard was blackmailing Luke Atmey, who was in turn, blackmailing Ron DeLite. And upon killing his blackmailer, Luke Atmey tried to frame Ron DeLite. He then claimed to be guilty as Mask☆DeMasque in order to escape his true crime...\nPhoenix:\nAnd to that end, he came up with this plan... ...to use the \"Double Jeopardy\" rule when making his alibi.\n???:\nUmm...\nJudge:\nAt any rate... It would seem we've finally found the truth.\n???:\nExcuse me...\nJudge:\nI came perilously close to besmirching the record of an innocent young man... ...Besmirching him with the title of \"murderer\"!\n???:\n...Don't ignore meeeeeee!\nJudge:\n...Oh. I didn't realize you were there.\nPhoenix:\n(Why wouldn't he be...?)\nRon:\nUm... About the verdict...\nJudge:\nI know. You never committed any murder.\nRon:\nThat's right! I'm so glad you understand that! But... I, um... I really am Mask☆DeMaaaaasque!!!\nJudge:\nHuh?\nRon:\nSo, thanks to that trial yesterday, I'm innocent now, right?\nPhoenix:\nUh...\nRon:\nWhat was it you said? \"Double Jeopardy\"?\nJudge:\nNow that you mention it...\nGodot:\nI've been careless.\nPhoenix:\n(Careless...?) Um... What do you think, Mia?\nMia:\nAs the defendant says, the rule of \"Double Jeopardy\" is absolute. A defendant can never be tried twice for a crime in which he was once found innocent.\nPhoenix:\nThen... Mask☆DeMasque is really innocent?\nMia:\nIt would seem so... for now. (Changed from [For now... it would seem so.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(F-For now...)\nJudge:\nNow then! This court finds the defendant...\nNot Guilty\nRon:\nBoy, this is really lucky... Wait, err, I... That isn't so good after all. You see the thing is, I still am Mask☆DeMasque after all\nOctober 14, 3:35 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 4\nMia:\nYou did it, Phoenix! (Changed from [You did it, Nick!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nThanks, Mia! It's been a long time, hasn't it?\nMia:\n...Yeah. It's because Maya doesn't call on me much these days.\nPhoenix:\nOh?\nMia:\nI'm just joking, Phoenix. Don't take everything so seriously. But on the other hand, Maya... She seems kind of torn these days. (Changed from [But on the other hand, Maya... She seems kind of lost these days.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nYou mean about becoming the Master of the Kurain Channeling School?\nMia:\nBecoming the Master... means saying goodbye to our mother.\nPhoenix:\nMisty Fey... right? (Changed from [You mean Misty Fey...?] in the original release)\nMia:\n...Watch over her, will you, Phoenix?\nPhoenix:\nOf course.\nMia:\nWell then... See you around.\nPhoenix:\n(Mia...)\nRon:\nAh! M-Mr. Wright! Um... I, uh... I don't know what to say.\nPhoenix:\nCongratulations, Mr. DeLite.\nRon:\nTh-Th-Thank you so much! ... Err, no, wait. Nothing really matters anymore though, now that all of this has happened\nMaya:\nCome on! Just be happy already!\nPhoenix:\nMaya...\nMaya:\nYou've been cleared of the murder charges and got off as Mask☆DeMasque to boot!\nRon:\nBut, in exchange... I lost everything.\nMaya:\n...Huh? What do you mean?\nRon:\nStealing security information from KB Security, becoming Mask☆DeMasque... I did it all for one reason... For her.\nPhoenix:\nYou mean your wife, Desirée?\nRon:\nShe hates criminals more than anything.\nPhoenix:\n(Come to think of it, she was once held hostage by some robbers, wasn't she?)\nRon:\nShe always said how she hated sneaky criminals... I knew that. I knew that, but... Once I got fired from KB Security and lost all the money I had... ...she wouldn't have any reason to stay with me. I thought, she would leave me for sure.\nPhoenix:\nSo, that's why you became Mask☆DeMasque...?\nRon:\nYes... But, it's all over now... A broken bowl can never be put back together!\nMaya:\nTh-That's not true! Right, Nick!?\nPhoenix:\nRight.\nRon:\nR-Really!? Can we go back to the way things were!?\nMaya:\nYou'll be fine! And Nick can prove it!\nPhoenix:\n(I can? I kind of wish you would check with me first...) Mr. DeLite, even if a bowl is broken, there is always a way to put it back together.\nDesirée:\nNicky boy...\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes?\nDesirée:\nI'm really glad I asked you to defend my Ronnie. Thank you so much! I'll never forget what you've done for us.\nPhoenix:\nOh, well, um... Take care of yourself.\nDesirée:\nYou too, Nicky boy. ...............\nPhoenix:\n(*gulp*... I can feel my face going red.)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Mystic Maya! Congratulations! ... *gasp!*\nPhoenix:\n(...Talk about bad timing.)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! How could you!? With another man's wife! In front of Mystic Maya! No no no! You've got it all wrong! I'll NEVER forgive you!! Never! Ever!\nSo just as the case came to a close, so too did my consciousness. Ron said, \"a broken bowl can never be put back together.\" But I know that's not true. I mean, just look. Here's a perfect example of one that was put back together even better than before.\nEpisode 2: The Stolen TurnaboutTHE END"

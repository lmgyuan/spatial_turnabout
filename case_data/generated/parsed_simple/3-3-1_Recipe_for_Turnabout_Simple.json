I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts.\nI-It wasn't me! I swear it wasn't me!\nJudge:\nThe evidence and testimony we have seen and heard are conclusive! The victim was alone at his table when he drank from that poisoned cup of coffee.\nNo! You're wrong! I know what I saw...! I saw... I saw...! I saw someone else there! A man. He's the real killer! Why won't anyone believe me?\nPayne:\nWell... I'd say that pretty much wraps this case up, wouldn't you... ...Mr. Wright!?\nJudge:\nThis court finds the defendant...\nGuilty\nJudge:\nThe court is adjourned.\nJanuary 6, 10:03 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nMaya:\nAhh! The start of the new year always makes me feel like I can take on the whole world!\nPhoenix:\nI bet it does, Maya.\nMaya:\nSo! I've decided that our resolution should be... Zvarri! \"Take on the world!\" What do you think?\nPhoenix:\nSure, whatever, Maya... But I think maybe you've had more than enough mistletoe cake.\nMaya:\nNever! You've got to eat a lot of cake during New Year's! It's practically a tradition! Like watching the fireworks on TV or playing a board game.\n???:\nHEY, PAL!\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe...\nMaya:\nHappy New Year, Detective!\nGumshoe:\nUh... likewise... NOW LISTEN UP, WRIGHT! I WANNA...\nMaya:\nHere's to another fruitful year of lawyer-police cooperation!\nGumshoe:\nUm... Yeah... Me too... ALRIGHT, PAL! YOU'VE GOT SOME EXPLAINING TO...\nMaya:\nHave you got a holiday present for me, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nA what? Well... I, um... Here, have this. It-It's really nothing much, but...\nMaya:\nYay! Thanks!\nGumshoe:\nLOOK, PAL, WE NEED TO HAVE A TALK. TAKE A SEAT!\nMaya:\nHey! What about Pearly? You haven't forgotten her present, have you?\nGumshoe:\nAh... N-No... I mean, yes... I mean, no... Are you doing this on purpose?\nMaya:\nHa ha, guess I'm busted. How did you like my first practical joke of the year?\nGumshoe:\nVery funny, pal. Now let's see how funny you think it is when I show you this!\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it? A magazine?\nMaya:\nHey, I wanna see! \"Deadly Poisoning Brings Guilty Verdict. Defense Attorney Wright Trounced.\"\nPhoenix:\nTr-Trounced!? Let me see that! \"The defense attorney gave an almost childishly amateur performance yesterday...\" What the heck is this!?\nGumshoe:\nIt's a report, pal. About you!\nMaya:\nListen to this! \"Mr. Wright must take full responsibility for the ruling in this case.\"\nGumshoe:\nWELL!? And don't tell me you don't remember anything about it!\nPhoenix:\nBut I don't remember anything about it! When was that issue from anyway?\nGumshoe:\nUmm... December of last year, which I guess makes it last month.\nMaya:\nWhich makes it old news, you mean.\nPhoenix:\nBut I wasn't involved in a poisoning case in December!\nMaya:\nHmm, so what do you think this is all about, Nick?\nGumshoe:\nIf it wasn't you, pal, then that leaves only one possibility...\nMaya:\nNo way. You don't mean...\nPhoenix:\nA pho...\nMaya:\nA phony Nick!?\nPhoenix:\n(This must be Gumshoe's idea of a joke. Guess he's starting off the year with one, too...)\nMagazine Clipping added to the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\nSO!? What are you gonna do about it, pal!?\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean, what am I going to do about it?\nMaya:\nWell, it's your fault that the judge found the defendant guilty in this case!\nPhoenix:\nMy fault!? How do you figure that?\nMaya:\nBecause THE Phoenix Wright is super famous now! Well, maybe only sort of...\nGumshoe:\nYeah. See what happens when you hotshots start getting too full of yourselves?\nPhoenix:\n(But I didn't do anything wrong! ...At least, not that I can remember...)\nGumshoe:\nYou better make this right, pal. Now! And that means taking the case back to court. Got it?\nMaya:\nSounds like we've got our first case of the new year! Let's tackle it with gusto!\nPhoenix:\nI don't know... The judge already issued a guilty verdict once in this case. It's not going to be easy to get it overturned.\nMaya:\n... I guess that New Year's resolution is going to have to wait until next year.\nGumshoe:\nSo you're taking the case, right!? Good! I'm gonna head over to the courthouse then. After that, I'll go back to the precinct. Drop by if you need something, OK pal!?\nPhoenix:\n(I guess people are starting to know the name \"Phoenix Wright\". If a client entrusted a case to me based on my reputation... I guess I am kind of responsible. But why would someone want to impersonate me? What sort of a guy would do that?)\nJanuary 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept.\nMaya:\nIt's been ages since we came down to the precinct, huh, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nLooks like Gumshoe isn't around.\nMaya:\nHe's got it so easy, leaving everyone else to do the work!\nPhoenix:\nNo, he's been out there somewhere. My bet is on the courthouse. He's probably trying to arrange the retrial of this case.\nMaya:\nGuess that means we should go to the detention center and chat with our killer, huh?\nPhoenix:\nAfter being convicted without a fair trial, I'm not sure killer is the right label...\nJanuary 6Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nMaya:\nThis is so nerve-wracking, waiting to meet our new client. I wonder just what kind of person you tricked and got found guilty...?\nPhoenix:\nK-Keep it down, Maya! That kind of talk could ruin me!\n???:\nAaaaaaaah! How could you, Mr. Wright!? How could you do this to me!? They put me in solitary! I haven't been able to stop crying.\nPhoenix:\nA-Aren't... you...\n???:\nYes, I am! I am totally and utterly let down!\nMaya:\nAah! You're... Are you...?\n???\nDon't pretend you don't know me! It's me, Maggey, remember!? Maggey Byrde!\nPhoenix:\nMaggey Byrde... Ah! (Maggey Byrde... She's the policewoman I defended that one time. She was accused of murdering her lover. He was a cop, too.) What are you doing in here!? Didn't I get you acquitt--\nByrde:\nOh, sure! Very funny! After that fifth-rate defense job, you come in here and start making jokes!?\nMaya:\nYou better hurry up and tell her what happened, Nick.\nByrde:\nO-Oh... I see...\nPhoenix:\nSo that's where we stand right now.\nMaya:\nI'm sorry you've been caught up in another murder...\nByrde:\nMy whole life has been nothing but a whirlwind of bad luck and failures.\nPhoenix:\n(I vaguely remember her saying the exact same thing last time...)\nByrde:\nBut I don't mind! What's one more disaster in my life? At least now the real Mr. Wright is here with me. I won't let the world keep me down, sir!\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Magazine Clipping:\nByrde:\nMr. Wright... Do you think it's possible to get a retrial?\nPhoenix:\nProbably. The court ruled in the absence of a genuine defense attorney. So we should be able to get a retrial.\nByrde:\nUm... Mr. Wright...?\nPhoenix:\n?\nByrde:\nDo you think we'll win next time? ...Sir?\nPhoenix:\n...!\nByrde:\nMy life has been a full course meal of bad luck, complete with defeat for dessert. Since I was 6 months old, when I fell from the 9th floor of my apartment building... ...I've been hit by all sorts of vehicles, gotten sick from all sorts of foods... ...failed at almost every test I've taken, experienced almost every kind of disaster... I even landed a phony lawyer when I had the misfortune of being accused of murder. But! I will survive! Because Maggey Byrde always lives to fight another day! And one day, I'll find it! Just you wait and see, sir! I'll find that one, single moment of good luck!\nMaya:\nArgh, Xin Eohp is really gonna pay for this!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What are you staring at me like that for...? (But Maya's right... Whoever it is that thought it was a good idea to use my name... ...and get an innocent girl convicted of murder had better watch out!)\nMaya:\nWe'll find him! Don't you worry. We'll get Xin Eohp for you!\nByrde:\nThank you! Oh! I'll tell you where Trés Bien is then!\nPhoenix:\nTrés... Ah, right. The restaurant where the murder took place.\nByrde:\nYes, sir. When you go, please tell Mr. Armstrong I said hi!\nMaya:\nSure! Alright, Nick! Let's go check out this restaurant and its food!\nJanuary 6Trés Bien\nMaya:\nWow! Look at this place.\nPhoenix:\n\"Look\"? More like \"smell\"... What is with the suffocating scent of flowers in here...? Then again, girls like that sort of thing, right?\nMaya:\nActually, I'm not all that into it...\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\n... No one's coming to seat us. Maybe there's no one here.\nPhoenix:\nDon't be silly, Maya. This is a restaurant, and it's open for business. HELLO! ANYONE HERE? ... I don't believe it! There really isn't anyone here!\nMaya:\nPerfect! Let's get intrusive! If there's no one here, we can take anything we want!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, I suppose we can...)\nWright & Co. Law Offices\nDetention Center\nAfter presenting Sports Paper in Detention Center - Visitor's Room:\nJanuary 6Trés Bien\n???:\nOh là là! Bon-JOUR! Welcome to la Trés Bien!\nMaya:\nOh! Hel... lo... ...\nPhoenix:\n(What happened to Maya? She's frozen stiff...)\n???:\nBienvenue! Welcome to my petite restauranté!\nMaya:\nHuh? \"Bee Avenue\"?\n???:\nOh, non, my petite chulip!\nMaya:\nHuh? Me?\n???:\nLook at z'is face! Like la kitten rejected by its own mother. You are fatigued, non? Alors! You need z'is! An aromatic bath oil mélange of la néroli and la rose. My personal recommendation!\nMaya:\nYou think I need what...?\n???:\nOui, oui! Just add a couple of drops of z'is mixture to la bath water, and voilá! It will soothe your body and your mind. It's simply fantastique!\nMaya:\nReally?\n???:\nAnd for la monsieur!\nPhoenix:\nWho? Me?\n???:\nLook at z'at face! Like la puppy rejected by life itself! You are fatigued, non? For you, monsieur, I recommend z'is! Oil of bergamot. And maybe a 'int of... Oui, oui! I will add la peppermint and la clary sage for a fragrance exceptionnel! Such an invigorating recipe will bring out your delicious beauty, monsieur!\nPhoenix:\nM-My beauty!?\n???:\nAlors. If you will be seated, I will bring you la special menu of z'e day!\nPhoenix:\nActually, we're not here to eat. We're lawyers.\n???:\nMais bien sûr! I know z'is already, monsieur. You are la Phoenix Wright, non?\nPhoenix:\nUm, yes... You know me?\n???:\nMais, oui oui! I never forget a man who flirts wiz me! Especially in court!\nMaya:\nI guess he was cross-examined by our mysterious Xin Eohp...\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like everyone to do with this case knows who \"I\" am already.\nMaya:\nI wonder what sort of impression Xin Eohp's been leaving on people, don't you?\nArmstrong:\nAllow me to introduce myself to you again. I am Jean Armstrong. Enchanté!\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\nUm, Mr. Armstrong... Could I just confirm something with you again? The table where the victim was sitting... Was anyone else sitting there?\nArmstrong:\n... Z'at is a question you will 'ave to ask 'im yourselves.\nMaya:\nHuh? \"'Im\"?\nArmstrong:\nLa old man spends all of 'is time dans la parc.\nPhoenix:\nLa p-parc? Oh, a park? What park's that?\nArmstrong:\nBehind la restaurant. It is called, \"Vitamin Square\".\nMaya:\nThank you!\nArmstrong:\nJe vous en prie, my dear!\nMaya:\nLet's go check out this Vitamin Square right now, Nick!\nJanuary 6Vitamin Square\nMaya:\nSo this is Vitamin Square.\nPhoenix:\nYeah. I see where they get the name from now. The fruits scream \"VITAMINS!\" at you.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! That's the guy, right? Isn't that the old man Mr. Armstrong was talking about?\nPhoenix:\nThat grouchy-looking grandpa?\nMaya:\nHe's throwing seeds out for the pigeons.\nPhoenix:\nMaya, he's not throwing seeds for them, he's throwing seeds AT them!\nOld Man:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh... My grumpiness-threat level has just been raised to red...)\nDetention Center\nTrés Bien\nVitamin Square\nAfter presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien:\nJanuary 6Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\nLooks like they have Maggey in questioning. I guess I've asked her pretty much everything... I'll come back if there's anything else I need to ask her later.\nAfter presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien:\nJanuary 6Wright & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nPoor Maya. It looks like Mr. Armstrong's really taken a shine to her. I suppose I'll just have to let her work at the restaurant for a while. I'll go pick her up from Trés Bien once things have cooled off.\nAfter presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien:\nJanuary 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept.\nGumshoe:\nWell, pal!? Have you found the evidence yet!? The one that's gonna find her innocent!?\nPhoenix:\nUm, no. Not yet. We've only just started our investigation.\nGumshoe:\nWell, whatever you need to know, I'll give you the dirt on it. I'm putting off all my other cases for now, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(Gumshoe's really fired up about this...)\nGumshoe:\nOh, yeah! One more thing! The retrial's been approved. Court's sitting at 10 AM tomorrow. And Godot's gonna be the prosecutor...\nPhoenix:\n(Oh. ... Him.)\nGumshoe:\nNow, listen up, pal! If Maggey's found guilty again...\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes...?\nGumshoe:\nUm... I'll... I'll make sure you get locked up good for it, got it!?\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Sports Paper in Police Station - Criminal Affairs Dept.:\nJanuary 6Trés Bien\nPhoenix:\nThe scent of flowers sure is strong. It's almost making me dizzy... Oh, um... Hello. (Who was that just now? A customer? She had sort of a dark aura about her...)\n???:\nAh! Welcome! Bee avenue!\nPhoenix:\n(Wow. What a cute voice.)\nMaya:\nOh, it's just you, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nM-Maya!\nMaya:\nWell? How do I look?\nPhoenix:\n... Maybe you should quit being a spirit medium...\nMaya:\nMaybe. But it's kind of boring being a waitress. I mean, you're my first ever customer.\nPhoenix:\n(Then who was that woman I just saw?)\nMaya:\nOh, oh! Since you're here, you might as well have something to eat!\nPhoenix:\n... I am kind of hungry, actually.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\nUm... About the lunch...\nMaya:\nOh! A fine choice, sir.\nPhoenix:\nNo. I, um...\nMaya:\nKITCHEN! A LUNCH SPECIAL, PLEASE! WITH ALL THE EXTRAS: DRINK, SIDE SALAD, DESSERT, AND GIFT!\nPhoenix:\nI don't need any of that!\nMaya:\nJust a moment, please, sir.\nPhoenix:\n(Maya's really getting into this! So how much is this set lunch, then? 20 dollars, huh? But with the drink, side salad, and dessert, it's... 45 dollars!?) Hey, wait a sec! Maya!\nMaya:\nSorry to keep you waiting, sir! Here you are, our deluxe Fortify lunch set!\nPhoenix:\nWhoa!\nMaya:\nA dish inspired by lobster and abalone fricassée with balsamic vinaigrette. Bon appétit!\nPhoenix:\nUm, thanks...?\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! Hurry up and try it already!\nPhoenix:\n(Lobster, huh? Alright... Down the hatch it goes...) ... Urp!\nMaya:\nWell?\nPhoenix:\nAre you hungry, Maya?\nMaya:\nI'm starving!\nPhoenix:\nHere. It's yours.\nMaya:\nReally!? ... Urp!\nPhoenix:\nRemember, Maya. My wallet doesn't print money, so you'd better polish off that plate!\nMaya:\n... I-I've just remembered! I've got to clean the toilets!\nPhoenix:\nHey! (You can't be in that much of a hurry to clean the toilets!)\nTrés Bien Lunch Special added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nHow does that guy manage to make good food taste so bad?\nMaya:\nHey, Nick... You want to take a peek at the kitchen?\nPhoenix:\n(The kitchen, huh? Not a bad idea.)\nAfter clearing \"Kitchen\" Talk option in Trés Bien:\nJanuary 6Trés BienKitchen\nMaya:\nAnd here it is! The famous Trés Bien kitchen! It's my first time in here too, actually.\nPhoenix:\n... There is a weird atmosphere in here, that's for sure.\nMaya:\nMr. Armstrong will be back soon, so we'd better search quickly! Chop, chop!\nAfter examining oil bottles in Trés Bien - Kitchen:\nJanuary 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept.\nGumshoe:\nHey, you're just in time!\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nThe lab got back to me about that newspaper you gave me.\nPhoenix:\n(He must mean this sports paper with the memo scribbled on it...) So? What did they say? Did the analysis turn up anything?\nGumshoe:\nThey said the doodle was written by the victim, Glen Elg. No doubt about it.\nPhoenix:\n(I expected as much...)\nGumshoe:\nThe victim took the paper with him to the restaurant on the day of the murder. That's our best interpretation of the facts at the moment.\nSports Paper refiled into the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\n\"MC Bomber\"... I get the feeling I've heard that name somewhere before... Oh, well. I guess it'll come back to me. Don't forget to report back to me with whatever you find in the restaurant, OK, pal?\nPhoenix:\n(Since when did I start taking orders from Gumshoe...? Although... I get the feeling there's something I need to show him...)\nAfter examining table in Trés Bien - Kitchen:\nJanuary 6Vitamin Square\nPhoenix:\nHmm, the old guy's not here anymore. (Drat. And I still have some unanswered questions for him.)\nPhoenix:\nA scooter, huh? Who'd leave it right in the middle of the park like this? The wheel guard and the light are busted... I guess it must have been in an accident. It's totally wrecked.\n???:\nGwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar!

(Guess I better make a note of the scooter...)\nScooter added to the Court Record.\n???:\nKah! Pathetic!\nPhoenix:\nOh, it's you.\nOld Man:\nA few threats from a little brat like that... ...and you look like a pigeon that's got seeds in its eyes.\nPhoenix:\nHave you been here the whole time then?\nOld Man:\nI was in that strawberry. I had some thinking to do.\nPhoenix:\n(More like you had some cowering to do!)\nCriminal Affairs Dept.\nTrés Bien\nMaya:\nOh, it's that old man... Is he still feeding the pigeons?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. He \"fed\" me as well. I got a bunch of those seeds in my eyes.\nMaya:\nOoh, ouch!\nPhoenix:\nHey, Maya. Would you mind coming with me for a while?\nMaya:\nHuh? Me? Why?\nPhoenix:\nThere's something I really want to ask that old man.\nMaya:\nSure, OK. I'll just get changed.\nPhoenix:\nNo, hang on! Can't you... go like that?\nMaya:\n... I guess...?\nVitamin Square\nPhoenix:\nUm, sir...\nKudo:\nHmph! You again? ...\nMaya:\n?\nKudo:\nHmm... Well, well... I see...\nMaya:\nUh, Nick. His eyes are burning into me!\nPhoenix:\nIt's OK. I think it's going pretty well.\nKudo:\n... Kah!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nKudo:\nYou're still just a little child! Run along and play on the slide, alright?\nMaya:\nP-Play on the slide?\nPhoenix:\n(Argh! We were so close! Just a little more and he would've spilled...)\nKudo:\nHmm, ha-hmm, hmm... Hmm, pi-pi-pigeon, hmm... Kah!\nPhoenix:\n(How can we crack this guy?)\n???:\nUm, excuse me please, sir...\nKudo:\nQuiet! Can't you see I'm feeding... the... pige...\nPhoenix:\nMia!?\nKudo:\nWell...\nMia:\nIf you don't mind, sir... I'd really love to talk with you.\nKudo:\nYes. Yes, yes. Of course. Certainly. I'm Victor. Victor Kudo.\nPhoenix:\n(Even from beyond the grave... Wow...)\nMia:\nWhatever did Mr. Armstrong do!?\nKudo:\nOh, no! Those eyes! I can't take this!\nPhoenix:\n(Mia's really got this guy eating out of her hand...)\nKudo:\nHe steals things. From his customers.\nPhoenix:\nFrom his customers?\nKudo:\nGloves, handkerchiefs... Little things, mainly. He's a pilferer! So you be careful around him, my dear.\nMia:\nAre you sure about this?\nKudo:\nOf course! He was arrested for it once. I was there when it happened, having my javaccino.\nPhoenix:\n(He really is a regular!)\nKudo:\nLet me write you a little haiku about it.\nPhoenix:\nA haiku?\nKudo:\nA Japanese poem. It'll explain all you need to know about that chef.\nVictor's Note added to the Court Record.\nKudo:\nIf he takes anything again, you let me know! If it's not too expensive, I'll buy you a replacement!\nPhoenix:\n(Poor guy. He couldn't do enough for Mia.)\nMia:\nOK, Phoenix. That's about as much as I can do to help.\nPhoenix:\nThanks, Mia. We got some really important information thanks to you.\nMia:\nHonestly! I can't believe Maya called me for something like this!\nCriminal Affairs Dept.\nAfter clearing \"Armstrong's secret\" Talk option in Police Station - Criminal Affairs Dept. and clearing \"Armstrong's record\" Talk option in Vitamin Square:\nJanuary 6Trés Bien\nMaya:\nI guess it's about time to wrap up today's investigation.\nPhoenix:\nHad enough of being a waitress?\nMaya:\nYeah. Plus, no one came to the restaurant...\nArmstrong:\nOh là là! Mademoiselle Maya! Non! 'Ow can you leave like z'is!?\nMaya:\nI-I'm sorry...\nPhoenix:\n(That reminds me. Mr. Armstrong had a Psyche-Lock or three, didn't he? I'm going to have to break those...) Mr. Armstrong. I hope you won't mind, but I'd like to have another word with you...\nArmstrong:\nVolontiers! Of course!\nArmstrong:\nI did not take it! La ticket for 'alf a million, I mean.\nMaya:\nBut you just told us you did! You said you took a ticket!\nArmstrong:\nMais non, ma fille! It was not...\n???:\nThat's enough.\nMaya:\nHuh? AAAAAAAAAH! Mr. Godot!\nPhoenix:\nWhat in the heck are you doing here!?\nGodot:\nUrgh! This is without doubt... the worst coffee I have ever tasted, Mr. Armstrong.\nPhoenix:\n(He came in here for coffee!? Does his craving for coffee know no bounds!?)\nGodot:\nPerhaps Mr. Armstrong stole one of the victim's tickets on the day in question.\nArmstrong:\nI am la air'ead, non? Just a pretty little girl who everyone is laughing at.\nMaya:\nBut, in that case, Maggey shouldn't be the only one under suspicion...\nGodot:\nHe had the wrong ticket.\nPhoenix:\n...What?\nGodot:\nMr. Armstrong made off with the winning ticket's pretty neighbor.\nMaya:\nSo... the ticket he took was worthless?\nGodot:\nNot quite. He did win something. A dollar.\nArmstrong:\nYou see! I am just a pretty face! W'izout my looks, I 'ave nothing!\nPhoenix:\nSo... What happened to the winning ticket, then? The one he meant to steal.\nGodot:\nIndeed. What did happen to it? I don't like spoiling myself by watching trailers, so... ...we'll just wait and see how the movie turns out tomorrow, won't we?\nMaya:\nNngh...\nArmstrong:\nVoilà! You two! Time to laugh at la pretty little air'ead!\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like I won't be needing this note anymore.)\nVictor's Note thrown into the trash.\nPhoenix:\nLooks like we've got a new mystery now. Namely, where did the winning ticket go?\nMaya:\nI've got a bad feeling about this.\nPhoenix:\nWell, anyway. We can't let Maggey suffer any longer for this. And certainly not again.\nTo be continued."

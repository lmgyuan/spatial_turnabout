Stop waving that broom around!\nMaya:\nOh, Nick! I didn't know you were here!\nPhoenix:\nOf course I'm here! What was that surreal show you were watching?\nMaya:\nWhat!? Nick, you mean, you don't know the Steel Samurai!? He's only the most popular TV hero for young people!\nPhoenix:\nYoung...? Like, how young?\nMaya:\nUmm... 10 years old?\nPhoenix:\nThen what the heck are YOU doing getting all excited!?\nMaya:\nHey! I'm only 17! That's seven-\"teen.\" See? I'm a teen! Not like you, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nHey! Don't talk to me like I'm your grandpa or something. I'm only 24 myself.\nMaya:\nThen watch it with me! He's really cool! And... it's really popular! When they asked grade school kids what they wanted to be, \"Steel Samurai\" was no. 1! ([no. 1] written as [no.1] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nI really worry about kids these days.\nMaya:\nGramps! Well, the Steel Samurai's over. I guess it's time to close up the office.\nPhoenix:\nI guess... Wish we had some clients!\nPhoenix:\nA month has passed since my trial. Mia's murder was the talk of the town for some time... But no one paid any attention to the Wright & Co. Law Offices... How am I going to pay the rent this month?\nMaya:\nIt'll be okay.

You mean the guy on that show?\nMaya:\nYes! They're saying that the Steel Samurai killed a villain!\nPhoenix:\n... Umm... Isn't that what he's supposed to do?\nMaya:\nYeah, on TV!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, on TV.\nMaya:\nNo! I mean, he actually did it! In real life! He skewered a villain with his Samurai Spear!\nPhoenix:\nI have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.\nMaya:\nJust come to the office, quick! Please, Nick!\nCellular:\n*beep*\nOctober 16, 9:22 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\n(Maya's here... watching television.)\nTV:\nNow for the morning news. The actor Will Powers was arrested yesterday. Powers plays the lead role in the popular kid's show \"The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo.\" He was arrested on suspicion of murder. The victim was Jack Hammer, who plays the villain known as the \"Evil Magistrate.\" His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. The \"Samurai Spear\" was also found stuck through the body. Police believe this was the murder weapon, and are investigating further.\nPhoenix:\n... This has to be a joke.\nMaya:\nNo, no, no! It's a nightmare! The Steel Samurai is over! The world is over!\nCellular:\nBrrrrring... Brrrrring...\n*beep*\nMaya:\nYes... Wright & Co. Law Offices. ... What!? Nick!

Go where?\nMaya:\nThey have the Steel Samurai down in detention!\nPhoenix:\nSo what!?\nMaya:\nSo, I've decided this will be our first case!\nOctober 16Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nMaya:\n...\nPhoenix:\nWhat's wrong, Maya? It's him! In the flesh!\nMaya:\nUmm... Is that guy really him?\nPhoenix:\nWhaddya mean \"that guy\"? Of course it's him! Will Powers, our client! That's him.\nMaya:\nUm, maybe I shouldn't be saying this... But he definitely did it. Murder. At least once. Maybe twice.\nPhoenix:\nWhoa whoa whoa! What are you saying!?\nWill:\nUmm...\nMaya:\nY-yes!?\nWill:\nSomething wrong...?\nMaya:\nN-no! No!\nPhoenix:\n(This is getting off to a great start.)\nWill:\nI know, I know. You're disappointed, aren't you?\nMaya:\nD-disappointed!? Oh, no. Oh no.\nWill:\nNo, it's okay. This is the real me. When I got the part of the Steel Samurai, with that mask... I decided I would never show my face in public until the job was over. It's the kids, you know. I didn't want to wreck their dreams.\nMaya:\nOh...\nWill:\nI guess it didn't matter. So much for dreams. I wonder what they think of the Steel Samurai now. *sniff* Uwaaah!\nMaya:\nNick!\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nMaya:\nHe's a good guy! I mean, he's good!\nPhoenix:\nYeah.\nMaya:\nHe didn't do it!\nPhoenix:\n...\nAfter clearing \"Powers's alibi\" Talk option:\nPhoenix:\nI think I should probably check out the scene of the murder...\nWill:\nRight...

Awesome! Aren't you excited!?\nOldbag:\nHey! You there! You want in, you gotta go through me!\nMaya:\nO-oh... s-sorry! W-we're, um, lawyers.\nOldbag:\nOh yeah? Well that's great. I'm security! And it's my job to make sure that gawkers like you stay OUT.\nMaya:\nG-gawkers?\nOldbag:\nGawkers! Sightseers! Tourists!!! I know the type. You heard about the incident and came to snoop around. Youths today! Something horrible happens and all you can think of is sightseeing. Wasting your time at a place like this. Don't you have jobs you should be doing? Or do lawyers not work like the rest of us? Maybe I should become a lawyer too. Sounds like a life of ease to me no work just loafing around all day as you please. Well when I was young things were a mite different, mind you we didn't prance around in strange hippie clothes. What are the youths coming to these days my own son hasn't called in...\nMaya:\nUmm... Nick? Will I grow up to be like her? Please say \"no.\"\nPhoenix:\nI dunno! It's possible.\nOldbag:\nHey! Listen when you're being spoken to! Youths today!\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nOldbag:\nIsn't it about time for you to be heading home? There's nothing to see here. Move along.\nPhoenix:\nUm, actually, we're here at Mr. Powers's request.\nOldbag:\nHmph! I thought you were suspicious lookin'! Show me a \"letter of request.\" And maybe I'll just let you in.\nMaya:\nThis lady here thinks she owns this place, obviously.\nDetention Center\nWill:\nHello! How was the studio? They all think I did it, don't they?\nMaya:\nN-no, not at all! Isn't that right, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nRight, not at all. At worst, you're a suspect.\nWill:\n*sniff*\nWright & Co. Law Offices\nStudio - Main Gate\nPhoenix:\nMa'am, have a look at this. It's a letter of request from Mr. Powers.\nOldbag:\nHmm...? Yes, yes. I recognize the bold, childish scrawl.\nGave Powers's Request to the security lady.\nOldbag:\nTo think he would entrust his fate to youths of such unreliable appearance... Really!\nPhoenix:\nReally?\nOldbag:\nAnyway, you may pass. But only left from here, toward the studios! No going to the right. That's the Employee Area. \"No one allowed inside, pal\" were my instructions. The good detective told me himself.\nMaya:\nHey, hey, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMaya:\nThere were maps in the security guard station.\nPhoenix:\nHey! Not bad!\nOldbag:\nThose are 50 cents a piece,\nthank you!\nMaya:\nWell, time to go, Nick.\nOldbag:\n50 cents!\nGuidemap of Global Studios added to the Court Record.\nOctober 16Studio One Entrance\nGumshoe:\nHey! Aren't you that murderer from the other day!\nMaya:\nAah! It's that confused detective!\nGumshoe:\nHey pal, you know Prosecutor Edgeworth is all upset, and it's your fault! I saw him sipping tea and staring gloomily out the window!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... so?\nMaya:\nHey! If he's depressed, it's all your fault for doing sloppy detective work!\nGumshoe:\n!!! ... ... ...\nMaya:\nUm, Detective?\nPhoenix:\nI think you hurt his feelings.\nMaya:\nOh no! I... I'm sorry!\nPhoenix:\nWell, I think his feelings are easily hurt.\nGumshoe:\nYou're right, pal. It's all my fault. I can blame other people all I want, but I know the truth in my heart!\nMaya:\nHey, hey! Don't take it so hard! There's always the next case!\nGumshoe:\nYeah, I suppose you're right. Hey! What exactly are you two doing here?\nMaya:\nUm, well... We're on this case too, pal!\nGumshoe:\nHuh!? Hey! You can't just go saying \"pal\" like that! That's MY endearing character trait!\nMaya:\nI'd say he's a character alright...\nAfter clearing \"The investigation\" and \"Decisive evidence\" Talk options:\nGumshoe:\nWhat's wrong, pal? You seem down.\nPhoenix:\nDon't look so happy when you say that.\nGumshoe:\nOh hoh hoh hoh hoh!\nMaya:\nUmm... We'd like to ask the employees here some questions...\nGumshoe:\nSure thing, pal. Go wherever you like. Of course, you're not going to find any clues I haven't already found! Hah hah hah!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm glad someone around here seems to be enjoying themselves.)\nMaya:\nNick, let's go! We've got a free pass to the place. Now's our chance to check things out!\nStudio - Main Gate\nMaya:\nNick! Look! That security lady is in the guard station stuffing her face with donuts! I guess all cops like their donuts!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, and they're soft enough she doesn't need teeth to chew them...\nOldbag:\nHey, you! Well? Are you satisfied Powers is guilty yet?\nPhoenix:\n(Urk! She had to make my life harder by giving that photo to Detective Gumshoe...)\nOctober 16Wright & Co. Law Offices\nMaya:\nWhat's going on, Nick!? Powers said he was sleeping in his dressing room! But now there's a photo of him going to the studio!?\nPhoenix:\nDon't look at me! How should I know?\nOctober 16Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nApparently they have Mr. Powers in questioning.\nPhoenix:\nHmm... right.\nGumshoe:\nLook pal, that camera takes a picture automatically whenever someone walks by. And it took a picture of Will Powers!\nPhoenix:\nI have to ask him about that photograph!\nMaya:\nOh well. Let's try again later.\nOctober 16Global StudiosEmployee Area\nMaya:\nNick! This is where they do all the behind-the-scenes stuff! Hey! Look! There's Powers's dressing room! No one's here this soon after the murder I guess. Let's take a look around!\nOctober 16Global StudiosDressing Room\nPhoenix:\n(Powers's dressing room... So this is where he was sleeping? Or at least, this is where he claims he was sleeping.)\nMaya:\nNo one actually saw him taking a nap here, did they?\nPhoenix:\nRight, and there's a picture of him near the crime scene. (I hope he's telling the truth... for his sake!)\nWright & Co.

That white tape! It's so... so real!\nPhoenix:\nWell, the Evil Magistrate did die here. And the Steel Samurai killed him. The murder weapon was the Samurai Spear. Sounds pretty real to me...\nMaya:\nWow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!\nPhoenix:\nYeah! So don't touch it!\nMaya:\nWhoa! It's heavier than I thought...\n???:\nHey! You! No touching that!\nPhoenix:\nAh, um, sorry, my partner is kind of, y'know...\nMaya:\n\"Y'know\"!? No I don't know!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... who are you?\nPenny:\nWho me? I'm an assistant here. I help with props and stuff. Moving them around, ordering new ones, et cetera.\nMaya:\nWe're lawyers representing Mr. Will Powers.\nPenny:\nOh, you're WP's people.\nMaya:\n\"WP\"...? Oh, Will Powers. W.P., I get it.\nPenny:\nI don't envy you guys one bit! But... do what you can for WP, okay? He'd never hurt a fly! He has to be innocent.\nMaya:\nDon't worry, leave it to us!\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nMaya:\nWhat do we do, Nick? We haven't found anything. If WP was the only one who came to the studio... Then he has to be the killer! They even have a photograph...\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\nPenny:\nUmm... Sorry... I know you're busy.\nPhoenix:\nNot really.\nPenny:\nActually, there's been something bothering me.\nMaya:\nAh hah! That's what I'm talking about! A clue! A lead!\nPenny:\nWell, I don't know about that, but that day, just after noon, I sensed someone was here...\nPhoenix:\nYou \"sensed\"?\nPenny:\nYes, several times.\nPhoenix:\nSome other studio employees, maybe?\nPenny:\nNo, I don't think so. The only thing we had scheduled was an action scene run-through. I was the only assistant here that day. I have a feeling it was someone from... outside.\nPhoenix:\nR-really!?\nMaya:\nBut wait, if someone had come in here... Wouldn't that security lady have noticed them?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, you're right.\nPenny:\nI'm sorry I don't have any better information than that.\nMaya:\nNo, thanks! That helps us a lot. Anything helps. Let's go put that security lady on the spot!\nOctober 16Global StudiosMain Gate\nOldbag:\nWhat? You're still here? Really! You look as though you've seen a ghost!\nOldbag:\nWhat? I saw that suspicious look on your face!\nPhoenix:\nI wanted to ask you again about yesterday... You came here at 1:00 PM, correct? And the estimated time of Hammer's death was 2:30. Are you sure that Powers was the only one to go through here between those times?\nOldbag:\nSure as can be!\nMaya:\nBut we have a witness who thinks there was \"someone from outside\" here that day.\nOldbag:\nWhat!?\nMaya:\nAre you absolutely sure you were here watching the whole time?\nOldbag:\n...\nMaya:\nMa'am?\nOldbag:\nWho was it? Who told you that? Who dares question ME!?\nMaya:\nEek!\nOldbag:\nAlright you better tell me and tell me quick, you spiky-haired cretin! Someone's been complaining about the work I do, eh!?\nMaya:\nUh... um, we were just talking to the assistant in Studio One.\nOldbag:\nHer! She's not even a full-time employee! All you young'uns are like that nowadays, running your mouths like there was no tomorrow saying this that and the other thing. Well when I was young let me tell you we knew a thing or two about respecting our elders. Back then we did and it's a crying shame that you youths today just say what you please about poor old ladies Graaaaaaaaaaaawr!\nPhoenix:\nShe left...\nMaya:\nWell, Nick? This is our chance to do what we can without her looking over our shoulders!\nPhoenix:\nThere! Entered! ...\nMaya:\nHey! It printed out the data for that day!\nPhoenix:\nLet's see what we got... ... Huh?\nMaya:\nHow is this a picture of Will Powers?\nPhoenix:\nWell, he is the one who always wears that suit... I guess that's why the security lady thought it was him.\nMaya:\nI don't imagine the detective was very happy with this photo as evidence. Hmm? Something's printed on the back.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2]\nMaya:\nWhat does that mean?\nPhoenix:\nMaybe there's more photo data from that day?\nMaya:\nNope--that's the only one in the computer.\nPowers's{?} Photo added to the Court Record.\nMaya:\nHey, hey, Nick! Can't we use this photo as evidence for the trial?\nPhoenix:\nYeah.\nMaya:\nWe'll put that security lady in her place with this!\nPhoenix:\nRight, we'll put her in her place...\nMaya:\nHey, that's what I said! Anyway... Let's show her this photo and see what she says!\nPhoenix:\nWait. Let's not.\nMaya:\nWhy not?\nPhoenix:\nIt's never a good idea to reveal your hand to the enemy too soon.\nMaya:\nNick! You're craftier than I gave you credit for. Why, you could be the next... Evil Magistrate!\nPhoenix:\nHey! Why do I have to be the villain.\nMaya:\nRelax, it was just a joke! So, are we done for today?\nPhoenix:\nI think this photo is what we needed for the trial. Still, it'd be better if we had some idea who the real killer was! Maybe it really is that security lady...?\nTo be continued.\nBefore selecting \"ST1-307\" upon examining computer in Global Studios - Main Gate:\nOctober 16Studio One\nMaya:\nNo one's here. I wonder if the security lady got mad at that assistant?\nPhoenix:\nHmm. That's definitely a possibility.\n\nOctober 18, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4\nJudge:\nThe court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.\nEdgeworth:\nThe prosecution is ready, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nVery well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.\nEdgeworth:\nThe prosecution will show the court that at 2:30 PM on October 15, the defendant, Mr. Will Powers, killed fellow actor Jack Hammer at Studio One of Global Studios. It is impossible for anyone else to have committed this heinous crime. The evidence presented during the trial will all point to this fact.\nJudge:\nHmm. I see. Very well, I would like to move on to your testimony. Mr. Edgeworth, the prosecution may call its first witness.\nEdgeworth:\nVery well, I call a most familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand. (Changed from [First, I would like to call a familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand.] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\nDetective, if you would briefly describe this case to the court?\nGumshoe:\nYes sir! I'll explain with the guidemap here. To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see? This here is the Employee Area. The actors did a run-through of their action scenes during the morning here. This is the main gate to the studios. The security lady that works at the studios was here at 1:00 PM on that day. Past the security station there is a gate, see? Past that are the studios. And here it is... Studio One. This is the scene of the murder, where the body was found! Now, on the day of the murder, October 15, there were only three people here. The victim, Jack Hammer, the defendant, Will Powers, and a young woman, the production assistant. All the production staff were in the Employee Area until noon. Then after lunch, the victim, Jack Hammer, went to Studio One. Right after that, at 1:00 PM, the security lady got to the guard station. Now, jump ahead to later that day... 5:00 PM. The production staff came to Studio One to perform a rehearsal. Needless to say, the rehearsal was cancelled... The time of death was 2:30 PM. The \"Samurai Spear\" found lodged in the victim's chest was the murder weapon. That's the case, in brief. Anyone like to hear that again?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... should I listen to that whole thing again...?)\nPhoenix:\n(I think I can probably remember that...)\nJudge:\nSo the murder weapon was a \"spear\"? How... medieval!\nSamurai Spear added to the Court Record.\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor. This case is quite simple if you ask one question: And that question is: \"What did the security lady at the guard station see?\"\nJudge:\nUnderstood.\nEdgeworth:\nLet's call this security officer to the stand!\nEdgeworth:\nWill the witness declare her name?\nOldbag:\n... Hmm? My, aren't you a handsome fellow! I'm afraid I'm a bit flustered!\nEdgeworth:\nY-your name, please!\nOldbag:\nOh, dearie! No need for you to be embarrassed! Just call me \"grandma.\"\nEdgeworth:\nYOUR NAME, PLEASE!\nPhoenix:\n(Seems Edgeworth has a bit of trouble getting his witnesses to say their names...)\nOldbag:\nWendy Oldbag, dearie. So just call me \"grandma.\" It's practically my name! So even when I was young I was an Oldbag, but not really that was just my name dearie. Still how the other children would make fun of me and just because of my name can you believe it? But there was this boy, the captain of the chess club in junior high, and when he called me an old bag well I just cried and cried because I had a crush on him you see--\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nO-objection! I... object to the witness's talkativeness.\nJudge:\nObjection sustained! The witness will refrain from rambling on the stand.\nOldbag:\nI was just getting to the good part, dearie!\nEdgeworth:\nPerhaps we can get to the testimony?\nJudge:\nNow, the witness was stationed at the main gate on the day of the murder, correct?\nOldbag:\nYessey I was.\nJudge:\nAnd to get to the scene of the murder, someone would have to pass by you?\nOldbag:\nYou know your stuff, dearie!\nJudge:\n... You may begin your testimony.\nPhoenix:\n(She sure is one hell of an Oldbag...)\nWitness Testimony\n-- Witness's Account --\nOldbag:\nOn the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.\nPoor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.\nI, well, I had some errands to run that morning.\nAnyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.\nI was at the main gate from then until 5:00!\nNow, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?\nInteresting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.\nIt was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!\nJudge:\nYou saw the defendant, then? Hmm... Very well. Let's begin the cross-examination. Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.\nCross Examination\n-- Witness's Account --\nOldbag:\nOn the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.\nOldbag:\nPoor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.\nOldbag:\nI, well, I had some errands to run that morning.\nOldbag:\nAnyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.\nOldbag:\nI was at the main gate from then until 5:00!\nOldbag:\nNow, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?\nOldbag:\nInteresting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.\nOldbag:\nIt was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!\nMaya:\nNick... Doesn't she seem like she's enjoying this a little too much?\nPhoenix:\nWindbags love gossiping about other people's misfortunes.\nMaya:\nUgh. Can't she get her kicks somewhere else?\nPhoenix:\nLet me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag! You've been saying since yesterday that you \"saw Mr. Powers,\" correct? But you're talking about the man in this photo, aren't you!\nJudge:\nJ-just a moment, Mr. Wright. Let me see that photo! ... What is this, exactly?\nPhoenix:\nNone other than the Steel Samurai, defender of Neo Olde Tokyo. Ms. Oldbag! Is this the \"Mr. Powers\" that you saw!?\nOldbag:\nOf course! Didn't your momma teach you any sense, sonny? Anyone can plainly see that's Powers! Right?\nEdgeworth:\nNo, they can't! (Changed from [Um, yeah.] in the original release) ... Umm... well. I mean, I wonder? (Changed from [Umm... well. I wonder?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nTrue, Mr. Powers does play the role of the Steel Samurai! But that doesn't mean Mr. Powers IS the Steel Samurai!\nOldbag:\n...! I... I know that! I wasn't born yesterday!\nJudge:\nNo one in this court is accusing you of that, Ms... er, witness.\nPhoenix:\n(He's having trouble calling her \"Oldbag\" apparently...)\nJudge:\nHowever, you do not have proof that the person in this photo is Mr. Will Powers, do you?\nOldbag:\nHumph! Nosy old man! Of course I have proof!\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nEdgeworth:\nHuh!?\nPhoenix:\n(Even Edgeworth is surprised!?)\nEdgeworth:\nThe prosecution would like to ask the old... the witness. Please make known all the information in your possession ahead of time!\nOldbag:\nHow was I to know everyone would be so nosy! You should be ashamed, all of you! Anyway, I showed that photo to the young detective. He told me \"this isn't any good as evidence, pal.\" He didn't even give it a second look!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Wow, old windbag has left even Edgeworth speechless. She's good!)\nJudge:\nLet's hear about your proof, then.\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Man in the Photo --\nOldbag:\nI never say anything I don't mean, mind you!\nThat morning, during the run-through of the action scene...\nI saw Powers trip and fall!\nHe broke one of the props, it was a big mess.\nApparently, he sprained his ankle pretty bad.\nNow, look at that picture!\nYou can see he's dragging his leg! See? Clear as day!\nThat's how I knew it was Powers. Happy?\nJudge:\nHmm. So he had sprained his ankle...? Very well. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.\nPhoenix:\n(She's got to be hiding something... I'll press her until she squeals.)\nCross Examination\n-- The Man in the Photo --\nOldbag:\nI never say anything I don't mean, mind you!\nOldbag:\nThat morning, during the run-through of the action scene...\nOldbag:\nI saw Powers trip and fall!\nOldbag:\nHe broke one of the props, it was a big mess.\nOldbag:\nApparently, he sprained his ankle pretty bad.\nOldbag:\nYou can see he's dragging his leg! See? Clear as day!\nOldbag:\nThat's how I knew it was Powers. Happy?\nMaya:\nWell, Nick? Find any glaring contradictions?\nPhoenix:\nWell, she seems pretty sure that was Powers in that photo... I guess I'll just press her and see if I can shake her conviction...\nAfter pressing second or third statement, then pressing fourth statement:\nEdgeworth:\nI think we've heard enough! Haven't we, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nWell, there is one thing that bothers me.\nEdgeworth:\nWhich is?\nJudge:\nWhere is this \"Steel Samurai\" costume now?\nEdgeworth:\nUmm... hmm. Actually, well... We couldn't find it. We're looking, though.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nEdgeworth:\nAnyway, that's not important! The witness did see the Steel Samurai, yes. And it is clear that the person in the Steel Samurai suit was Mr. Will Powers!\nJudge:\nHmm... I suppose that's right.\nPhoenix:\n(Are you sure you're sure, Your Honor?)\nEdgeworth:\nWill the witness continue her testimony, please?\nOldbag:\nNo need to ask twice!\nWitness Testimony\n-- Witness's Account, cont. --\nOldbag:\nThe time of poor Hammer's death was 2:30 PM, true?\nThe only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers!\nNo one else went there!\nIf they had, I would have seen them!\nJudge:\nHmm... So, if no one else went to the studio... Then it would have to be this \"Steel Samurai\" who did it. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.\nCross Examination\n-- Witness's Account, cont. --\nOldbag:\nThe time of poor Hammer's death was 2:30 PM, true?\nOldbag:\nThe only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers!\nOldbag:\nNo one else went there!\nOldbag:\nIf they had, I would have seen them!\nMaya:\nOld windbag sure has balls! Or... well, you know what I mean.\nPhoenix:\nOld windbags have a way of skipping over important details, after all... Or, for that matter, entirely forgetting them.\nMaya:\nHow convenient.\nPhoenix:\n(Something for you to look forward to, perhaps?)\nPhoenix:\nHold on! Look at this photograph one more time. This photo was taken by the camera at the gate for the studios, correct?\nOldbag:\nYesiree, sonny.\nPhoenix:\nSo, whenever anyone passes by here, it automatically takes a picture?\nOldbag:\nAnd here I thought you didn't know your head from a hole in the ground.\nPhoenix:\nRight... Anyway! It's also true that the computer in the guard station records all security cam data.\nOldbag:\nOoh! You know, if you wanted to work at the studio, we might have an opening.\nPhoenix:\nThat very computer printed out this photo. Note that on the back of the photo are printed the words: [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2]\nOldbag:\nEven I know that means it was taken at 2:00 PM on October the 15th! Really, sonny!\nPhoenix:\nActually, I knew that too. The issure here is the bit at the end where it says: \"Photo #2\"...\nOldbag:\n\"Photo #2\"...?\nPhoenix:\nThe computer only held data for one photo on that day. Don't you think that's odd? Shouldn't this photo be \"Photo #1\" if it really was the ONLY photo!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Please tell the court what you mean by this, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nActually, that's what I want to ask the witness. This evidence shows that not one, but two people went to the studio that day. Yet there is only data for one of the photos! Who could have erased the data for the other photo? Only someone with access-- the security lady herself! (Changed from [Only someone with access... the security lady herself!] in the original release)\nOldbag:\nEh!? You watch your mouth, whippersnapper! The only person I saw that day was Will Powers!\nPhoenix:\nBut the camera on the gate fired twice! That means two people went by!\nOldbag:\nUmm... well, yes... that's what it would seem to mean...\nJudge:\nCan the witness explain this to the court?\nOldbag:\nUmm... ahem. I-I don't understand these new-fangled computer things... Umm... E-Edgey-boy! Help!\nEdgeworth:\nHuh!? B-believe me, I want to, but I don't know what this means either.\nOldbag:\nHumph! Some help you are! You're a whippersnapper too! ... ... Whippersnapper...?\nJudge:\nSomething the matter, Ms. Oldbag?\nOldbag:\nAh! That's right! I... I just remembered something!\nJudge:\nLet me guess... Someone else passed by the gate... someone other than the Steel Samurai?\nOldbag:\nEr... well, yes, I suppose you could put it that way.\nJudge:\n*sigh* I see. Your testimony, please.\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Other Person --\nOldbag:\nEvery day, after I finish my guard duties, I have one other important job to do.\nI go through the photos recorded on the security computer and check them.\nI throw out any photos that aren't suspicious lookin', you see.\nCome to think of it, now I remember throwing out one photo that day!\nEdgeworth:\nM-Ms. Oldbag! This is the first I've heard of this!\nOldbag:\nWell, of course, sonny! I've only just remembered it.\nJudge:\nRight... anyway, Mr. Wright, please begin the cross-examination.\nMaya:\nWell, I'd say this was a turn for the unexpected, but I kind of expected this...\nCross Examination\n-- The Other Person --\nOldbag:\nEvery day, after I finish my guard duties, I have one other important job to do.\nOldbag:\nI go through the photos recorded on the security computer and check them.\nOldbag:\nI throw out any photos that aren't suspicious lookin', you see.\nOldbag:\nCome to think of it, now I remember throwing out one photo that day!\nMaya:\n\"Come to think of it\"? Couldn't she think of that a little earlier!?\nPhoenix:\nClassic old windbag maneuver, Maya.\nMaya:\nHmm... Might be a useful tactic to remember for use in my future career as a windbag.\nPhoenix:\n(Let's find out more about this \"erased\" photo.)\nPhoenix:\nWell, who in the heck was in that photo you erased!?\nOldbag:\nHumph. A fanboy.\nPhoenix:\nF-fanboy?\nOldbag:\nSteel Samurai fanboys. Real freaks, if you ask me. They get information about the rehearsals from gosh-knows-where. They're always hanging about. One was there that day.\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nW-wait a second! Didn't you just say no one else could get in!? \"I locked the main gate so no one could get in\"... Those were your words!\nOldbag:\nWell! If you must know, there's a drain that goes into the Employee Area. The grate has been loose for a while. It leads outside, and well, that's where they come in.\nPhoenix:\nThey come in through the drain?\nOldbag:\nI told you they were freaks. Oh, and...\nPhoenix:\nAnd...?\nOldbag:\nThey're kids. Children. Whippersnappers.\nPhoenix:\nK-kids!? So, on the photo that you erased...?\nOldbag:\nIt was a boy. Probably 2nd or 3rd grade.\nPhoenix:\nWhaaaaaaaaaaaat!?\nJudge:\nO-order! Order! Let me get this straight. You saw two people pass by the gate on their way to the studios that day? One was the Steel Samurai, dragging his leg. The other was a boy who looked to be in about 2nd or 3rd grade?\nOldbag:\nOh yes, well we see his type there every day. Can't stop 'em. Can't catch 'em.\nEdgeworth:\nA boy in 2nd or 3rd grade? Hmm... I assume it would be hard, if not impossible for a young boy to wield the Samurai Spear?\nJudge:\nImpossible, I'd think. It's quite heavy.\nOldbag:\nRight! As I said, I didn't pay him much mind. That's why I erased the data.\nMaya:\nUm, Nick? What's going on? I mean, the boy was there, that makes him a suspect!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, and they're already trying to \"un-suspect\" him.\nJudge:\nThis court will take a five-minute recess. (Changed from [I'd like to take a five minute recess.] in the original release) I want the defense and the prosecution to consider this new information... And no forgetting vital information this time!\nOctober 18, 11:08 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3\nPhoenix:\nMr. WP?\nWill:\nY-yes?\nPhoenix:\nTell me straight: were you really in your dressing room? You didn't go to the studio?\nWill:\nI-I didn't go to the studio! I was s-sleeping, honest.\nMaya:\nSo who was the \"Steel Samurai\" in that security photo?\nWill:\nHow should I know? The Steel Samurai costume was off in the corner of the dressing room. Anyone could have walked in and taken it, really.\nMaya:\nWhat!? You should take better care of that stuff!\nWill:\nI couldn't imagine anyone would want to steal a Steel Samurai costume! So... where does this leave me?\nPhoenix:\nIt doesn't look good...\nWill:\n*sniff*\nPhoenix:\nYou're the only likely suspect, right now.\nMaya:\nNick! W-what are we going to do!?\nPhoenix:\nFirst, we play for more time. We'll start targeting someone else that could conceivably have done this!\nMaya:\nRight! And it'll take them so long to shoot us down that we can get another day!\nPhoenix:\nRight... but if we pick the wrong person, we might lose on the spot.\nWill:\nYou... don't sound very optimistic.\nPhoenix:\nI'm not optimistic at all, actually.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick. It's time.\nPhoenix:\nOkay. Let's go. *sigh*\nWill:\nWhat does that mean... Please don't sigh like that! *sniff*\nJudge:\nCourt will now reconvene for the trial of Mr. Will Powers. (Changed from [The court will now reconvene for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.] in the original release) Mr. Edgeworth, will you present the prosecution's thoughts on this matter?\nEdgeworth:\nThe prosecution's thoughts are simple. Nothing has changed. The other person who went to the studios was a boy of roughly 10 years of age. The photo we do have may not be hard evidence... But there is still no one else that could have committed this crime! I call for a verdict of \"guilty\" for the defendant, Mr. Will Powers!\nJudge:\nHmm... Very well. Mr. Wright, your thoughts?\nPhoenix:\nThe defense disagrees with the prosecution's claim. There IS another person who could have committed this crime!\nJudge:\nOrder! Interesting... Let us hear who you have in mind! However... Be aware that this court does not look kindly on accusing the innocent. If you accuse someone who is obviously innocent, you will be penalized.\nPhoenix:\n(Right. Great. As if the stakes weren't high enough.)\nJudge:\nSo, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder?\nPhoenix:\nIt was the security lady! Wendy Oldbag!\nOldbag:\nW-who!?\nPhoenix:\nThe Steel Samurai is dragging his leg in this picture. That means whoever was in the suit knew about that morning's injury. Maybe because... they had been watching the action scene run-through! There was only one person other than Powers and Hammer who knew about the injury. The security lady, Oldbag!\nOldbag:\nW-what!? Whippersnapper!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! I-is this true, Oldbag!?\nOldbag:\nOldbag!? That's Ms. Oldbag to you!\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag was standing guard alone at the main gate. She was by herself... in other words, she has no alibi! She could have briefly left her post to steal the the Steel Samurai costume... Then slipped into Studio One, the scene of the murder!\nJudge:\nW-why would she go through the trouble of wearing the Steel Samurai costume!?\nPhoenix:\nSimple, Your Honor. She knew the camera at the gate would take her picture. If she was in his costume, she could point the finger at Mr. Powers!\nJudge:\nI see! Excellent deductive reasoning, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Ohhh yeah, right here! Sherlock Holmes II, baby!) ...? (That's odd. Isn't this the part where Edgeworth pounces...? Doesn't he usually jump up with an objection and some new damning evidence...?)\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Edgeworth? Does the prosecution have an opinion on this matter?\nEdgeworth:\n... The prosecution has no meaningful objections at this time.\nOldbag:\nW-w-what!? What's that supposed to mean!? Oh, so you all think I did it? Is that it!? Edgey-boy! Don't just sit there, do something!\nPhoenix:\n(What's my move? Maybe now's my chance to take this the whole way?)\nPhoenix:\nThe very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case... can be used to cast doubt on Ms. Oldbag's actions on that day!\nOldbag:\nB-but why would I do something so horrible to poor Hammer!?\nPhoenix:\nYou forget that Mr. Powers lacks a clear motive, too.\nJudge:\nHmm... Indeed.\nPhoenix:\n(That did it. Now windbag is one of the suspects. No hard feelings... I hope.)\nOldbag:\nWait just a minute! What about the other person who went to the studio!? The boy! The one whose photo I erased!\nJudge:\nHe's only a grade schooler though, as you said. 2nd or 3rd grade, was it?\nOldbag:\nTh-that doesn't matter! When I was that age, I could pin my old man in 10 seconds, tops!\nJudge:\nHmm... Your thoughts, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nThat boy is not the killer.\nOldbag:\nWhat!? How can you be so sure! Oh, or is it be nice to the kids and mean to your elders day? Whippersnapper!\nPhoenix:\nI have proof.\nOldbag:\nP-proof!?\nJudge:\nIndeed? Then let's see this proof, Mr. Wright. You have proof that shows the boy could not have committed this murder?\nJudge:\nI see! Well, would the witness care to comment on this?\nOldbag:\nMrph.\nPhoenix:\n(The windbag... speechless. This has got to be a first.)\nJudge:\nVery well! This court will suspend proceedings on the current trial for today. Mr. Edgeworth, please find out more about your witness, Ms. Windy... what was her name?\nEdgeworth:\nSomething \"Oldbag,\" Your Honor.\nJudge:\nThen the prosecution will look further into this Oldbag before we continue! That is all. The court is adjourned!\nOldbag:\nW-wait a second! I'm not going to just sit here while you run off barking up the wrong tree... me! I'm talking!\nMaya:\nOh, great, stop the presses! The windbag wants to talk!\nJudge:\nMs. Oldbag! What is this all about? Have you omitted something from your testimony?\nOldbag:\nActually, if you must know, there's something I was told not to talk about.\nPhoenix:\nN-not to talk about?\nEdgeworth:\nBy whom!?\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? You mean it wasn't Edgeworth who told her not to talk...?)\nJudge:\nW-well, testify!\nWitness Testimony\n-- My Lips Were Sealed --\nOldbag:\nGlobal Studios wanted me to keep quiet about something.\nThere were... some other people at the studios on the day of the murder.\nThey said they had \"nothing to do with it,\" see?\nSo they told me to just pretend they \"hadn't been at the studios that day.\"\nBut if you're going to go accusing me, I'm not letting them get away scot free!\nJudge:\nM-Ms. Oldbag! This is crucial information! Why did you keep this from the court until now!?\nOldbag:\nAin't you been listening? They told me to shut my trap, and I always do what I'm told.\nJudge:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(No, this isn't a bad dream, Your Honor. Witness the power of the Oldbag...)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright... Your cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- My Lips Were Sealed --\nOldbag:\nGlobal Studios wanted me to keep quiet about something.\nOldbag:\nThere were... some other people at the studios on the day of the murder.\nOldbag:\nThey said they had \"nothing to do with it,\" see?\nOldbag:\nSo they told me to just pretend they \"hadn't been at the studios that day.\"\nOldbag:\nBut if you're going to go accusing me, I'm not letting them get away scot free!\nMaya:\nNick! I guess pressing her was the right thing to do! For an old windbag, she sure likes keeping secrets... Let's get as much information as we can!\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor. We have learned there were others at Global Studios on the day in question. The director and the producer and, er, some bigwigs, were all present. Yet, as we stand here, they have not been questioned! I hold that it is impossible to declare a verdict on the defendant, Mr. Powers!\nJudge:\nHmm... The court acknowledges the defense's point. The prosecution will gather more information about the witness, Ms. Oldbag... and more information about these other people we have just been told of!\nEdgeworth:\n... I understand, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nThis ends the day's proceedings in the trial of Mr. Will Powers. That is all. The court is adjourned!\nOctober 18, 1:04 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3\nWill:\nTh-thank you so much, Mr. Wright. I was right to ask you to defend me.\nMaya:\nAww, really, it's nothing. *grin* Oh, or should I... *sniff*\nPhoenix:\nWe'll be going down to the studios to do some more investigation. We have to find out more about this director and producer. They'll be turning up in the next trial as witnesses for certain. So now's my chance to get material for the cross-examination!\nMaya:\nSo, Nick... Have we figured out just who it was in that Steel Samurai costume? Could it really have been old windbag?\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you think, Mr. Powers?\nWill:\nI don't think it was her, really.\nMaya:\nNeither do I, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nY-yeah, I know! Look, I was just buying time back there. Someone had to be the bad guy for a bit to take the pressure off Mr. Powers.\nMaya:\nPoor old windbag... I feel kinda sorry for her.\nPhoenix:\nWell, she wasn't winning any points in there, with or without my accusation. Okay, let's get down to the studios.\nMaya:\nRight! We'll be back to visit you soon...\nWill:\nTh-thanks. Thanks, guys. *sniff*\nTo be continued.\n\nOctober 18Wright & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nWhew, what a day.\nMaya:\nThis is no time for relaxing, Nick! Say, you think WP's got a chance?\nPhoenix:\nI guess that really depends on the people we found out about in today's trial.\nMaya:\nThe director and producer...?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, them.\nMaya:\nWell, what are we doing here then!? Let's get to the studios!\nOctober 18Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nWill:\nOh, Mr. Wright! Thank you for earlier.\nPhoenix:\nNot at all. We got lucky, to tell the truth.\nMaya:\nYou can say that again!\nPhoenix:\nLet's not.\nMaya:\nSo, WP! Do you have any leads that might get us going in the right direction?\nWill:\nHmm... S-sorry, but no.\nMaya:\nBe sure to tell us anything that comes to mind, no matter how small.\nPhoenix:\nWe can't rely on getting lucky again tomorrow.\nWill:\nY-yes... *sniff*\nOctober 18, 2:16 PMGlobal StudiosMain Gate\nMaya:\nNo one's here.\nPhoenix:\nRight, now that they have Ms. Oldbag in custody. I guess they don't have anyone else to replace her...\nMaya:\nH-hey! In the guard station! Look! She left her donuts! ... ... What? I wasn't going to eat them!\nOctober 18Studio One Entrance\nMaya:\nHey, Nick. It looks like Detective Gumshoe isn't here today.\nPhoenix:\nYou're right. He's probably up to his neck in paperwork after the commotion at today's trial.\nMaya:\nSo, Nick... Remember that \"Studio Two\" we heard about at the trial today? It was down that path with the fallen tree, right?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I think that's what they said.\nMaya:\nMaybe the director and the rest of them are there today? Now's our chance, Nick! Let's check it out!\nOctober 18Studio One\nMaya:\nI... don't really want to be in here.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... It is a murder scene.\nMaya:\nI want to go someplace else. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(*sigh*...)\nOctober 18Studio Two Entrance\nMaya:\nThis... is Studio Two?\nPhoenix:\nI thought so...\nMaya:\nIt doesn't really look much like a \"studio,\" does it?\nPhoenix:\nNo, that it does not.\nMaya:\nHey...

Oh... oh hoh hoh!\nPenny:\nActually, she just called me. She told me to cover up that drain...\nPhoenix:\nYou mean that one? (Wow, what a mess...)\nPenny:\nI... I know... I'm not so good with handiwork. Some assistant, right?\nMaya:\nYeah, but you do work on the props, and the backdrops, right?\nPenny:\nR-right. Just... lots of times they end up looking worse than they did before I fixed them.\nMaya:\nOh? Oh! Well, I'm sure these things happen. Nothing to worry yourself about!\nPenny:\nYou're right! I won't!\nPhoenix:\n(Personally, I think she should worry at least a little bit more...)\nPenny:\nUm, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to the guard station. I'm supposed to fill in for Ms. Oldbag.\nMaya:\nRight! See you later, then!\nPenny:\nGood luck with your investigation.\nOctober 18Global StudiosDressing Room\nMaya:\nThis is where the Steel Samurai costume was, on the day of the murder.\nPhoenix:\nThat's what Mr. Powers says, at least. I guess they snuck in and took it while he was sleeping.\nMaya:\nBut Nick, what if Mr. Powers hadn't been sleeping? I wonder what the killer was planning on doing then?\nPhoenix:\nHuh...

How could I, a sweet little old lady, wear a giant suit like that?\nPhoenix:\nMr. Powers is pretty tall...\nOldbag:\nAs soon as they saw there was no way I could wear it, they let me go.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess that would rule out her being the murderer.)\nOldbag:\nAnyway!

(What an original name...)\nVasquez:\nIts head fell over in the wind on the day of the murder. They didn't start moving the head out of the way until after 3:00. It was after 4:00 by the time the path was unblocked. Capice? Everyone in this trailer was stuck here until the path was cleared. Stuck in this trailer. Stuck until after 4:00. Hammer died at 2:30. Thus, none of us could have gone to Studio One.\nMaya:\nW-what!?\nVasquez:\nIt's true. A crane came just after 3:00 to move the head. We called some people in to clear the way. I'm sure they'd corroborate my story.\nPhoenix:\nB-but wait! What if the head fell over after 2:30? Then you could have gone to Studio One!\nVasquez:\n2:30... the time of death. ... Very well. Come.\nOutside Studio One\nVasquez:\n... That's \"Mr. Monkey.\" When it wasn't broken, it announced the time... in \"ooks.\" One \"ook\" per hour. Ook ook ook ook. Always with the ooking.\nPhoenix:\n(It IS a monkey, after all.)\nVasquez:\nCheck its head. The clock inside stopped when it broke.\nMaya:\n...! Nick, it's stopped at 2:15.\nPhoenix:\n2:15...?\nVasquez:\nThat's right. This path was blocked from 2:15 till after 4:00. Therefore, we're innocent.\nPhoenix:\nMr. Hammer died in Studio One at 2:30...\nVasquez:\nSee? Good bye.\nMr. Monkey's Head data added to the Court Record.

Huff... puff... huff... puff... huff... puff... huff...\nPhoenix:\nW-what's wrong?\nOldbag:\nHuff... puff... huff... puff... whih... whippersnapper!\nPhoenix:\n(She's been chasing that boy this whole time.)\nOldbag:\nHuff... puff... when... when I ca... catch him...

I got a hostage now, whippersnapper!\nPhoenix:\n(A \"hostage\"...!?)\nMia:\nWhy don't you let her borrow it, Phoenix?\nPhoenix:\nI guess it can't hurt. Here you go, Ms. Oldbag.\nCardkey lent to Ms. Oldbag.\nOldbag:\n... Listen to me, sonny. I don't like having debts to no whippersnappers. You take this, and we're even. Deal?\nPhoenix:\nWhat's this...? A Steel Samurai trading card?\nOldbag:\nThat sneaky kid dropped it! I figure it's pretty important to him, though.\nPhoenix:\nThank you, I may have a use for this. (This must be the \"hostage\" she was talking about.)\nSteel Samurai Card added to the Court Record.\nOldbag:\nRight. I'm off.\nPhoenix:\n(There she goes, hobbling off toward the studio...)\nOutside Studio One\nInside Studio One\nOutside Studio Two\nTrailer\nOctober 18Global StudiosEmployee Area\nPhoenix:\nHey! Hey, you! W-wait a sec!\nMia:\n... Phoenix... Was that the boy?\nPhoenix:\nYeah.

Found you!\nCody:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nDammit! He's getting away!\nMia:\nCome back! ... There. He's back.\nPhoenix:\n(How did she...!?)\nCody:\n...\nMia:\nHey there. Would you mind helping us out? Please?\nCody:\n... I-I'm Cody.\nMia:\nHello, Cody. I'm Mia. Mia Fey. Nice to meet you.\nCody:\nYo.\nPhoenix:\nAnd I'm Phoenix Wright!\nCody:\nWho asked?\nMia:\nPhoenix, you can take it from here.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not so sure I'm qualified...)\nAfter clearing \"The blocked path\" Talk option in Studio Two Trailer, then revisiting Wright & Co. Law Offices, then presenting Steel Samurai Card in Global Studios - Dressing Room:\nOctober 18Studio Two Trailer\nPenny:\nOh, hi.\nPhoenix:\nHello. What brings you here?\nPenny:\nOh, well, I had to arrange some stuff... Umm...\nPhoenix:\nYes?\nPenny:\nThe, um, girl with you. Doesn't she seem a little different? Like, is she even the same person as before?\nPhoenix:\nUm, nope! She's the same as always.\nMia:\nSame as always.\nPenny:\nOkay... whatever you say...\nPhoenix:\nDo you know anything about this?\nPenny:\nHey, that's a Steel Samurai trading card. I collect those, actually. I'm one card away from a complete set!\nPhoenix:\nA complete set?\nPenny:\nYeah, a set of one of each card.\nPhoenix:\nHuh...\nPenny:\n... Wait...Waitwaitwaitwait!!! That's it!!! That's the card I need! You don't know how long I've been looking for it!\nPhoenix:\nUh...\nPenny:\nI don't care what kind of girl you might think I am, I need that card! P-please! I beg you! Please trade with me!\nPhoenix:\nT-trade with you?\nPenny:\nYes, trade cards! Look, I'll even trade you an Ultra Rare Premium card!\nPhoenix:\nTrade me a... huh?\nPenny:\nYes, it's a good deal for your Ultra Rare! Please!!!\nMia:\nPhoenix! Can't you see she's desperate?\nPhoenix:\n(W-what's everybody getting so excited about...?)\nPenny:\nReally!? Th-thanks!!! Then this is for you.\nURP Card added to the Court Record.\nPenny:\nYaa-hoo!\nPhoenix:\n(And there she goes...)\nMia:\nDoesn't doing good things like that make you feel great?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. Yeah, it does.\nDressing Room\nPhoenix:\nSee this card?\nCody:\nYeah, so... Wait! That's it!!! That's the last Ultra Rare Premium card I need! C'mon give it to me, please! You gotta give it to me!\nPhoenix:\n(Wow, I've never seen him so... eager.) R-right! Okay! How about a trade?\nCody:\nYou're on! I'll give you a \"Samurai Spear\" and throw in an \"Evil Magistrate\" to boot!!\nPhoenix:\nNo no no no... not that kind of trade. I don't want cards. I want information.\nCody:\nHuh? You sure? Fine by me!\nURP Card given to Cody. (Changed from [Gave URP Card to Cody.] in the original release)\nMia:\nOkay, Phoenix. Let's hear what he has to say. If he knows something that could help us, we can have him take the stand tomorrow.\nPhoenix:\nCody... I need to ask you something very important. What did you see on the day of the incident?\nCody:\n... I got here that day around 2:00... I had to come in through the woods out back so that old lady wouldn't see me. I got kinda lost, though. I was in there for maybe a half hour or so. Then I finally got to the studio. After that...\nMia:\nWhat is it, Cody?\nCody:\nTh-the Steel Samurai killed the bad guy! He used his Samurai Spear! Just like always! One shot, one kill! It happened so fast... I got scared. I went home after that.\nPhoenix:\nI... I see. It must have been hard for you.\nCody:\nMan, you say those nice things but it's so obvious you aren't speaking from the heart.\nPhoenix:\n(Umm... right.) Mia?\nMia:\nYes?\nPhoenix:\nI think we can say for sure this means the Steel Samurai did it.\nMia:\nTrue enough.\nPhoenix:\nAnd the director has an alibi, so it wasn't him.\nMia:\nIndeed.\nPhoenix:\nSo... the only person left who it could have been is Will Powers!\nMia:\n... I have to admit, it's kind of a shock. But if you put this boy on the witness stand, your client will be \"guilty\" for sure.\nPhoenix:\nLet's not call him then...\nMia:\nI think that would be wise. Best to leave this one alone.\n???:\nNot so fast, pal!\nGumshoe:\nI heard everything! This boy here's a key witness! And he's under police protection, starting now! C'mon, son. You've got a rendezvous with me down at the precinct!\nCody:\nNo! I ain't going! Waah!\nMia:\n... That didn't go so well. We're back to zero leads. And now we have a serious handicap in court.\nPhoenix:\nW-what're we going to do, Mia!\nMia:\nWell, hmm... I... really need to be going. Don't worry, Phoenix. I'm sure you'll be fine!\nPhoenix:\nWhoa whoa whoa! C-come to the trial tomorrow, please! I need you there!\nMia:\nPhoenix, can I ask you something? Do you really believe that Mr. Powers is innocent?\nPhoenix:\nGreat! Thanks, Mia!\nMia:\nSee you soon.\nTo be continued."

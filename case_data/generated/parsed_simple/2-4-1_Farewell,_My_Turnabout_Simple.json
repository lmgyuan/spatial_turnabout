Will it be last year's runner-up, Jammin' Ninja!? Or maybe Captain Saipan all the way from the lovely tropical island of Saipan!? I see the students of a certain Starry School are raring to win! And Global Hero Onyankopon doesn't want to go home without the prize! We hope Lady Luck is with all our heroes tonight! And now! The winner of the third annual Hero of Heroes Grand Prix... IS ME!!\nWhoooooooooa! The true hero of the night has appeared in our midst! It looks like this year's Grand Prix goes to this fantastic warrior! The Nickel Samurai! Too bad, Jammin' Ninja. Looks like the title eluded you again this year!\nMarch 20, 7:42 PMGatewater HotelViola Hall\nMaya:\nAlright! Yes! Did you hear that, Nick!? Did you!? The Nickel Samurai! He did it!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, he sure did... *sigh* I'm getting too old for this.\nPowers:\nAh, I'm proud of the guy for doing the series justice.\nPearl:\nU-Um... So the person everyone was cheering for... I guess he got the prize?\nMaya:\nYup! You know who we're talking about, right Pearly? \"The Nickel Samurai\"!\nPearl:\nNo. Every Sunday, I only watch the Educational Channel's \"Kids' Masterpiece Theatre\".\nMaya:\nOK, that's it! From now on, it's \"The Nickel Samurai\"! All the kids watch it!\nPearl:\nDo you like \"The Nickel Samurai\" too, Mr. Nick?\nMaya:\nNah, Nick's an old fart, so he's not allowed to watch it anymore.\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. But I do like \"Kids' Masterpiece Theatre\".\nMaya:\nHey, I didn't know you were so young at heart, Nick!\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! You're a grown-up! You're not allowed to watch it anymore! You're supposed to act your age and have interests that match. ...It's very important.\nMaya:\nAw, give it a rest, Pearly!\nPowers:\nLooks like I made the right choice in inviting everyone here. I'm glad you're all having a good time.\nMaya:\nAaaaah... It's like a dream!\nPowers:\nToo bad for the Jammin' Ninja, though. Last year, he lost to The Pink Princess: Warrior of Little Olde Tokyo. I thought this might be his year...\nMaya:\nYeah... Oh, hey, did anyone else think that the Jammin' Ninja was a bit different today?\nPearl:\nDifferent? What do you mean?\nMaya:\nUm, well, he wasn't carrying his bright red guitar.\nPowers:\nHey, you're right! Strange he'd walk around without his signature guitar.\nPhoenix:\n(...*sigh* I will never understand these people and their shows...) Anyway, Mr. Powers, thank you very much for tonight.\nPowers:\nA-Aw, it was nothing... I owe you one, so it's just my way of saying thanks.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Come on! It's time to get going to the lobby! There's a post-ceremony stage show that's supposed to start real soon.\nPowers:\nAnd then, I heard there's going to be a press conference after that.\nPhoenix:\nA press conference? Is he going to make a speech about winning this year's prize?\nPowers:\nUh, well, not exactly... Something about the Nickel Samurai confessing something.\nPhoenix:\nConfessing...? Sounds pretty serious.\nMaya:\nArgh! Nick! COME ON! You don't want us to be the last ones there, do you!?\nPearl:\nYeah, Mr. Nick! Do you!?\nPhoenix:\n(Why me...? The show doesn't even start for another 20 minutes...)\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHallway\nPhoenix:\nWow, what is with this place? Looks like I've stumbled into Oz or something. Way in the back, there's a sign for the bathroom. Maybe I should visit it while I can before the show starts... (Changed from [I bet we have a little time to look around before the show starts...] in the original release)\nViola Hall (after clearing all Talk options in Gatewater Hotel - Viola Hall and visiting Hallway)\nPowers:\nSounds like the post-ceremony show is about to start.\nMaya:\nAlright! I'm so pumped! I wonder if he's going to show off his special move today? \"Nickel Samurai Smelting!\"\nPowers:\nActually, what I'm interested in most is the press conference.\nMaya:\nYou mean the \"big confession\" the Nickel Samurai's going to make after the show? So what is it? Don't you know what it's about, Mr. Powers?\nPowers:\nUh, well, I'm not the Steel Samurai anymore, so I don't have any idea.\nMaya:\nBah.\nPowers:\nS-Sorry. Ah, so I guess you are all going to the press conference then?\nMaya:\nYeah, of course!\nPowers:\nIf that's the case, then here, take these tickets so you can get in.\nPress Conference Ticket added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nThank you very much. Well, let's get going to the lobby.\nPearl:\nIt looks like it's over this way, Mr. Nick!\nMaya:\nOK! For great justice!\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Only a really gaudy hotel would have such a large, gaudy lobby to match.\nPearl:\nAh, I think they're going to have the post-ceremony show over there.\nPhoenix:\nThey're using a compact stage, I see.\nMaya:\nOoh... I'm all ready to use my special \"Samurai Power\".\nPhoenix:\n(Maya looks like she's ready to start a fight...)\nPA Notice:\nYour attention please, your attention please. The Nickel Samurai's Post-Ceremony Stage Show will not be held tonight due to unforeseen circumstances.\nMaya:\nWHAAAT!? WHYYYYY!?\nPhoenix:\nOww! You didn't have to pinch me! Pinch yourself if you don't believe it!\nPA Notice:\nWe are asking for everyone's cooperation at this time. So please stay where you are. ...This is a special request from the police.\nPearl:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nP-Police? Did they just say the police?\nPowers:\nD-Do you want me to go check out what's going on?\nPhoenix:\nUm, wait, I'll come with you...\n???:\nFreeze! You two! Didn't you hear the announcement just now!? It just finished telling you not to move!\nMaya:\nTh-That voice... I've heard that voice somewhere before...\n???:\nHonestly, youth these days can't be bothered to listen to other people when they talk! Just the other day it was the same thing! There was a small footbridge with a sign next to it that said, \"Beware, Bridge Out!\" And along comes a snot-nosed little punk kid right up to the bridge. I tried to tell the boy the bridge was out and it was dangerous, but would he listen!? No, of course not! He said he'd be careful and only walk on the \"in\" part of the bridge since the \"out\" part is what was dangerous! I am not kidding you here! The kid said that and really meant it! WELL! I really let him have it then, and knocked him clear off of that bridge! Honestly, kids these days don't know right from wrong, I tell you!\nPowers:\nThis non-stop chatter...\nPhoenix:\nI-It can't be... ...Ms. Oldbag?\n???:\n...\nOldbag:\nWhat is it, you young whipper-snappers!? Do I know you!? ...Wait. YOU! You're Powers, aren't you!?\nPowers:\nY-Yeah. Um, about what happened back then...\nOldbag:\nYou didn't even get nominated this year, did you? (Changed from [You didn't get nominated last year either, did you?] in the original release) Oh, that's right. You're doing that children's exercise program, trying to play nice.\nPowers:\nAh, yeah, that's me. Thankfully I still have a job...\nOldbag:\nI love that show, and you're a hoot! You're the \"big brother\" character, right? Yes, even with your face covered by a mask, I know. You're that giant rabbit! (Changed from [Yes, even with your face covered by a mask, I know. You ended up with a rabbit face.] in the original release) What a work of art, but that's how it is, you know? I mean, if you didn't wear the mask, who knows how many TVs you'd break? Really, and shame on those kids exercising around you. They're getting what they deserve. This is why I thought you shouldn't be anywhere...\nPhoenix:\nUm... What are you doing here?\nOldbag:\nLook at my uniform and tell me you can't tell I'm a member of security!\nMaya:\nBut that outfit...\nOldbag:\nAnnoying, noisy brats get the blaster!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nMaya:\n...Hey, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What is it? I don't like that devilish smile playing on your lips...\nMaya:\nLet's make like we're going to the bathroom, and check things out!\nPhoenix:\nN-No way. The police told us not go [sic] anywhere, remember?\nMaya:\nHuh!? How B-O-R-I-N-G! You're such a boring guy! You've got no motivation! No spirit!\nPearl:\nHuh? What? What's going on? Are you giving Mystic Maya trouble again, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Not you too, Pearls... Please don't stick your little nose into this one...)\nMaya:\nSo listen to this, Pearly. This one time at lawyer camp, Nick...\nPhoenix:\nO-OK! I get it! Let's go take a look.\nMaya:\nYay! I know you couldn't say no to me, Nick!\nPearl:\nThat's right. You'd walk over miles of hot coals for Mystic Maya, wouldn't you Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(That would be EVERY time we work a case together...)\nMaya:\nWell, what are we waiting for? Let's go already! You can come along too, Pearly.\nPearl:\nGoody! I get to come! I get to come!\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelViola Hall\nPhoenix:\nThere's nothing really out of the ordinary here...\nPearl:\nAre you looking for the \"in-si-dent\" that the old lady was talking about? (Changed from [Are you looking for the 'something' that the old lady was talking about?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nDoesn't look like it happened here. Well, we'd better go look somewhere else.\nMaya:\nAlright! Then, let's try...\nBellboy:\nExcuse me.\nMaya:\nAck!\nBellboy:\nAre you by chance, Ms. Maya Fey?\nMaya:\nUm, yeah... That's me.\nBellboy:\nYou have a phone call waiting for you at the front desk.\nMaya:\nA call? I wonder if it's someone from Kurain Village...\nPearl:\nWhat's wrong, Mystic Maya?\nMaya:\nOh, nothing. You guys go on ahead and I'll be right there, OK? (Changed from [Oh, nothing. I'll just go on ahead to check it out, OK?] in the original release)\nPearl:\nOK.\nBellboy:\nRight this way, Ms. Fey.\nPearl:\nLet's go look somewhere else now, Mr. Nick.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, OK.\nPearl:\nThis is a little exciting... And a little scary...\nHotel Lobby\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHallway\nI. TOLD. YOU. I get people the info they want! Which means that I've got a right to know!\nNope! Don't care who you are, pal, we're still investigating, so you can't go in!\nWhat's yer problem!? Just ya wait! It'll be all over the morning paper! \"Scruffy Detective's Secret Scandal Revealed!\" You'll see! I'll git ya back!\nPearl:\nThose two sound pretty serious...\nPhoenix:\n(That southern accent can only mean...)\nHey, Wright!\nPhoenix:\nH-Hey... Lotta...\nLotta:\nCome on, do a gal a favor and tell this cop I'm just doin' my job and I've got rights...\nGumshoe:\nAh, YOU!\nPhoenix:\nAh... Detective Gumshoe...\nGumshoe:\nHey pal, help a guy out! Tell her that only the police are allowed here! This is the scene of a murder, so she should leave this to us pros...\nPearl:\nA... A murder!?\nGumshoe:\nAw, shoot! Me and my big mouth!\nLotta:\nSee! I knew it! My gut instinct told me so! I always trust my gut! A murder, it said! And that's what it is! A genuine murder!\nGumshoe:\nH-Hey, wait...\nYeehaw, a murder! Of a big star, no less!\nGumshoe:\nOh, man... I'm in trouble now...\nAfter clearing \"The victim\" and \"Arrested?\" Talk options in Gatewater Hotel - Hallway:\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nPowers:\nHey! So what's going on, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like Juan Corrida has been killed.\nPowers:\nWh-Wh-What!? Juan is... He's...!?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like he was murdered... And a suspect was arrested. That suspect is Mr. Matt Engarde.\nPowers:\nY-You're joking, right!?\nPhoenix:\nNope. They arrested the Nickel Samurai on suspicion of murdering the Jammin' Ninja.\nPowers:\nOoogh... Not again... I feel sick.\nPearl:\n\"Again\"...?\nPhoenix:\n...About a year ago, something just like this happened, Pearls.\nPowers:\nI still can't believe... No way... No way Matt would...\nPhoenix:\n(...? What's Mr. Powers got in his hand...?)\nPowers:\n...Oh, before I forget... This... This is for you, Mr. Wright. I got this from the bellboy that came by earlier.\nRadio Transceiver received from Mr. Powers.\nPhoenix:\n...For me...? But why?\nPowers:\nI don't know. All he said was it was for Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPearl:\nUm... I was just wondering... Where's Mystic Maya? She's been gone a long time.\nPhoenix:\n(Now that she mentions it, she was only going to answer a phone call...)\nPearl:\nMaybe she got lost. I'll take a quick look around for her.\n...*beep beep beep*...\nPhoenix:\nAck!\nPearl:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Nick!?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? I... I'm not sure... (It's coming from this transceiver...) (Changed from [Did this transceiver just...?] in the original release)\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, hello? Wright here...\n???:\nIs this Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney?\nPhoenix:\nAnd you are...!?\n???:\nYou don't need to know who I am. I think you have other things to be concerning yourself with... Such as...\nMaya:\nHeeelp! Niiiiick!\nPearl:\nM-Mystic Maya!\nPhoenix:\nMaya...?\n???:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Wouldn't you agree that the more important issue is the fate of the girl?\nPhoenix:\n(Her fate? Does he mean what I think he means...?) Maya! Where are you!? Are you hurt!?\n???:\nCome now. Don't fall apart on me yet.\nPhoenix:\n(Th-This... No! This can't be!)\n???:\nNow that I have your attention, Mr. Attorney, I have a modest proposal for you. If you do what I require, then I will return to you your valuable \"item\" unharmed. ...What is this called again in your fancy lawyer terms?\nPhoenix:\n...\"Kidnapping for ransom\"...\n???:\nYes, that's it. This is a kidnapping.\nPearl:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Mystic Maya! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!\nPhoenix:\n(M-My sight... Everything's fading away... Maya... Maya... Maya's been kidnapped!)\n???:\n...--re you there? Mr. Attorney, are you there? (Changed from [You there? Mr. Wright, are you there?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nH-How much!? How much do you want!?\n???:\nVery good, Mr. Attorney. I'm glad you have such a good grasp of the situation.\nPhoenix:\nHurry up and state your condition! And then return Maya--\n???:\nMoney is not what I seek.\nPhoenix:\n...What?\n???:\nWhat I want is a certain verdict. I would like a complete acquittal.\nPhoenix:\nComplete acquittal!? Wh-What in the world have you done to need...!?\n???:\nI am not the person you will be representing.\nPhoenix:\nWhat...?\n???:\nYou are currently at the Gatewater Hotel, are you not? And I know that a murder has just taken place there.\nPhoenix:\nJuan Corrida was killed, and the suspect is Matt Engarde...\n???:\nYou are, as expected, quite on top of things, Mr. Attorney. Now then. What I want is very simple. I want you to obtain a complete acquittal for Matt Engarde.\nPhoenix:\nM-Matt Engarde? But why?\n???:\nHe did not kill anyone. I can attest to that. However...\nPhoenix:\nH-However!? However what!?\n???:\nHowever, someone is framing him for the murder. A very smart someone who is setting him up to take the fall...\nPhoenix:\n... (If I agree and do what he wants, can I believe he'll keep his end of the bargain!?)\n???:\nYou are, of course, at liberty to take me at my word or not. (Changed from [You are, of course, at liberty to believe me or not.] in the original release) However, there is one thing you can take as fact. Right now, your very precious \"item\" is with me, in my possession.\nMaya:\nMmngnhhh... Heeelp!... Nngmph... NIIIICK!\nPhoenix:\nMaya!\n???:\nYou have two days. Of course, tonight, he will be in questioning with the police. But the trial is in two days. At that trial, you will win a not guilty verdict. Remember, you only have one chance. One chance, Mr. Attorney. (Changed from [Remember, you only have one chance. One chance, Mr. Wright.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nO-One...!? Y-You expect me to get a not guilty in one trial day!?\n???:\nYes, exactly. I don't believe I was wrong in choosing you, so don't let me down.\nPhoenix:\nAagh!\n???:\nOh, yes, that's right. Now that I am playing the role of the kidnapper, I can't pass up this chance to say, \"And don't even think about callin' the cops!\" ...Hmm, not great, but you get the idea.\nPhoenix:\nD-Dammit! Who... Who the hell are you!?\n???:\nAlright, I'll tell you that much. My name is... ...De Killer.\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick! Wh-Where is Mystic Maya!?\nPhoenix:\n...She's been kidnapped.\nPearl:\nN-No... ... It's all my fault! If only I had gone with Mystic Maya...!\nPhoenix:\nIt's not your fault, Pearls.\nPearl:\nBut it is! It is! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaaaa! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\nPowers:\nMr. Wright... I think we... I think we should tell the police what it's [sic] going on...!\nPhoenix:\n(No! We can't do that! If we do, who knows what will happen to Maya...)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! What about the detective we saw earlier...?\nPhoenix:\n(...Detective Gumshoe!) Yes, that's it! Wait here, and I'll be right back!\nPowers:\nAlright! I'll take care of Pearl while you're away!\nHallway\nGumshoe:\nWHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!? RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANSOM!?\nPhoenix:\nShhh! Not so loud! ...The ransom is complete acquittal for Matt Engarde.\nGumshoe:\nWait, the deal is \"complete acquittal\" in exchange for Maya, you mean...? Then this means Matt Engarde is obviously the killer, pal! No doubt about it!\nPhoenix:\nBut the guy said that Mr. Engarde is innocent...\nGumshoe:\nYou really believe what a KIDNAPPER tells you, pal!?\nPhoenix:\n(I guess he has a point... If Engarde is really innocent, then why the kidnapping?)\nGumshoe:\nAnd on top of everything else, there's all this evidence we keep finding.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nThe forensics team's having a field day back there. (Changed from [The guys with the eagle eyes are really lapping it up like they just caught a huge fish.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nGumshoe:\nBut it's strange. There's so much evidence that it feels like something's wrong.\nPhoenix:\nThere's too much evidence? Is that possible? (Actually, didn't the kidnapper say something about Engarde being \"set-up\"...?)\nGumshoe:\nAnyway, looks like you won't be leaving here tonight, pal. Just sit tight and cooperate with the investigation. Tomorrow you can start yours.\nPhoenix:\n...A-Alright... (Isn't there another way...?)\nGumshoe:\nWe've also got to be careful about pushing the kidnapper the wrong way.\nPhoenix:\nYou're right...\nDate: ??? Time: ???Location: ???\nMaya:\nNnngh... Oww, my head... (Wh-Where... Where am I!? I wonder if I'm still in that hotel... Wh-What happened to me...?) Nick... Pearly! ... (Come on, you guys. This isn't funny anymore...)\n...*ka-click*...\n???:\nI see you have awoken.\nMaya:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Wh-Wh-Wh-Who are you!?\n???:\nMe? ...I am known as \"De Killer\".\nMaya:\n\"D-De Killer\"!? You mean like an \"ASSASSIN\"!? (I... I'm too young to die!)\n???:\nDon't worry. You are not my target. ...For now anyway.\nMaya:\nA-Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Nick! Nick! Where are you!? ...Help me...\n???:\nYes, that's right. Only one person can save you now, and that is Mr. Phoenix Wright.\nMaya:\n...Huh? Wh-What? Nick... Nick's going to save me...?\n???:\nCalm down and be a good girl. Think of this as a business transaction.\nMaya:\nA... A business transaction?\n???:\nI am going to contact him now. I hope you'll cooperate and play your assigned role well.\nMaya:\n...Nick... What's going to happen to me? Nick... Pearly... (Changed from [What's going to happen to me? Nick... Pearls...] in the original release) ...Sis...\n???:\n... Is this Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney? ... You don't need to know who I am. I think you have other things to be concerning yourself with... Such as...\nMarch 21, 8:11 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nPearl:\nGood morning!\nPhoenix:\nAh, morning, Pearls.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Mr. Nick! Come on! Let's hurry and go see Mr. Engarde!\nPhoenix:\nWe have to wait a bit, Pearls. Visiting hours don't start until 9 AM, so...\nPearl:\nOh, I see. Ah, Mystic Maya! If only... If only I had gone with you... (Changed from [Ah, Mystic Maya! If only... If only I went with you that time...] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Pearls... She's been like this since last night... We managed to get home somehow, yesterday evening... Thanks to Detective Gumshoe gently holding her by the hand and leading her here... But by the looks of it, I don't think Pearls got any sleep at all last night.)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Mystic Maya... She's alright, right!?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, she's alright. Either way, I'm going to save her. You can trust me on that.\nPearl:\nPlease... Please... Help her...\nPhoenix:\n(I'm only able to stay this calm and collected... Because Pearls is doing the crying for the both of us...)\nMarch 21, 8:57 AMDetention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\n(We couldn't wait for visiting hours to start, so Pearls and I came down here early... To visit one Nickel Samurai, charged with the murder of the Jammin' Ninja...)\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nG-Good morning. How are you today?\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nI know this situation might be a little tough for you...\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nUm... We're...\nEngarde:\nOh, sorry dude...\nPhoenix:\n...?\nEngarde:\nI already signed up...\nPhoenix:\nE-Excuse me...?\nEngarde:\nI already have life insurance. I signed up a long time ago cause my job is, you know...\nPhoenix:\n... Oh! No no no... We're not insurance salespeople!\nEngarde:\nReally...? Dude, I really don't need that right now either.\nPhoenix:\n...?\nEngarde:\nFire extinguishers. I mean, this building isn't my house, so...\nPhoenix:\n... No no no... We're not here to sell you fire extinguishers either! I'm a lawyer. My name is Phoenix Wright.\nEngarde:\nA lawyer...? ... Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask my manager, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nThe Nickel Samurai sure is a strange person, isn't he?\nPhoenix:\n(I think \"strange\" is an understatement.)\nEngarde:\nSorry about that. You're just in time.\nPhoenix:\nHuh!?\nEngarde:\nYou're a lawyer dude, right? My manager's looking for a good one right now, so how about it?\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick! This is our chance!\nPhoenix:\n(I have to make him let me take his case! I have to!)\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Press Conference Ticket and Radio Transceiver:\nEngarde:\n... ...Well, dude, I think it's about time for me to get going.\nPhoenix:\nPlease, wait! ...I really need to take your case!\nEngarde:\nThere's always other people in need of a lawyer, right? Want me to introduce you to a few?\nPearl:\nPlease! Please let Mr. Nick represent you!\nEngarde:\nMan, oh man. Lawyers these days. Now you dudes use kids to pull in clients, too?\nPhoenix:\nIf you don't take me as your lawyer, then De Killer is going to...!\nEngarde:\n... Wait... What did you just say?\nPhoenix:\n\"De Killer\"...\nEngarde:\nD-De Killer!?\nPhoenix:\n(...What's he doing? He looks like he's mulling something over...)\nEngarde:\n... Alright, dude. I accept your terms.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEngarde:\nI'll let you represent me in court.\nPearl:\nW-We did it! We did it, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nUh, yeah... (I don't feel any better for it... And he doesn't look too happy either...)\nEngarde:\nGo ahead, ask me anything. I'll help out as much as I can...\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\n... (...I guess this is about all I'm going to get out of him...)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah?\nPearl:\nLet's ask one last thing. Let's test Mr. Engarde to see if he really is innocent or not...\nPhoenix:\nW-We can do that...?\nPearl:\nYes. If you use this...\nPhoenix:\n(Maya's Magatama!)\nPearl:\nHe won't be able to hide any secrets from you, Mr. Nick. I'm sure of it.\nPhoenix:\n(I get it...!) ...Mr. Engarde, I'd like to ask you one more question. Please answer me honestly.\nEngarde:\nWhat is it, dude?\nPhoenix:\nDid you kill Mr. Juan Corrida?\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nPlease put the phone away and answer this question yourself.\nEngarde:\nAlright. Just so we're clear, dude, I didn't kill anyone, and that includes Juan Corrida, OK?\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nWell, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nNothing. Not a chain or lock in sight.\nPearl:\nWhich means... I think it is alright to trust him.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, it does appear that way. Well, at least I can breathe a sigh of relief knowing my client is innocent.)\nEngarde:\nUm... The trial's tomorrow, right? I'm counting on you, dude.\nTo be continued.\nMarch 21, 11:34 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nWell, at least we were able to get Mr. Matt Engarde as our client. And we know that he didn't do it... Which is very important...\nPearl:\nSo! So now what should we do!?\nPhoenix:\nWell, the trial is tomorrow. And we only get this one chance. There's only one way to prove Mr. Engarde's innocence. We have to find the real killer.\nPearl:\nOK! Then let's start looking!\nMarch 21Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nEngarde:\nAh, the lawyer dude. So what did you find out?\nPhoenix:\nUm, well... I'm still in the middle of investigating...\nEngarde:\nI see. ...But I've already told you everything I know, dude.\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nOldbag:\nHey! What do you think you're doing!? You can't come in without...\nPearl:\nGood morning.\nOldbag:\nHold on, it's YOU! What is going on around here!?\nPhoenix:\nU-Uh... Um...\nOldbag:\nI heard poor Juan was killed. Is that true!? It's a bad rerun is what this is. Another \"Steel Samurai\" doing the most evil of deeds.\nPhoenix:\nUm, you know... That's not entirely...\nOldbag:\nI'll have you know that I was a huge fan of Juan's! Why, oh why, do all the stars I'm interested in drop one by one like flies!? It's always been that way! Ever since I was a little girl in elementary school! The class hamster was fine until it was my turn to clean its cage, and then it died! The other kids started calling me the \"Queen Reaper\". I swear that's what they dubbed me! \"Whoever you name in your evil spell dies within three minutes,\" they would taunt.\nPhoenix:\nUm... Actually, I wanted to ask you about the murder and what happened...\nOldbag:\nHmph! Don't push me, boy!\nPearl:\nUm... Mr. Nick? I... Um... I couldn't hear everything she said... because she was talking too fast...\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, could you please speak a little slower...?\nOldbag:\nDon't boss me around, you spiky-haired, smarty-pants!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelViola Hall\nPhoenix:\nLooks like the investigation is still in full swing. The hotel staff and the police are running around like a bunch of headless chickens.\nPearl:\nI wonder if we can do any investigating of our own in this kind of atmosphere...\nPhoenix:\n...Well, got to roll up the sleeves and try, I guess.\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelHallway\nLotta:\nHey! Yer here! Been waitin' for ya, Mr. Lawyer!\nPhoenix:\nLotta...\nLotta:\nHey! Mr. Cop fella! The thief's showed his face!\nPhoenix:\nWh-Wh-What!?\nLotta:\nArrest him! Put him on trial! Find him guilty! Give him the death penalty!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What's wrong, Lotta!? Are you feeling alright?\nLotta:\nLooked here and there and up and down the mountain, but it ain't here! So why don'tcha just hurry up and give it back to me, ya creep! (Changed from [So why don't ya just hurry up and give it back to me, ya creep!] in the original release)\nPearl:\nUm, what are you looking for...?\nLotta:\nMy CAMERA! C-A-M-E-R-A! It's my life blood! I'm gonna die without my $700 camera!!\nPhoenix:\nY-Your camera...?\nLotta:\nLook, don't lots of people say the criminal always goes back to the scene of the crime!? And lookie lookie, here ya are!\nPhoenix:\nYep. Here I am... Faced with a Lotta trouble.\nPearl:\nHuh!?\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelEngarde's Hotel Room\nPearl:\nUm... Where are we?\nPhoenix:\nWe're in Mr. Matt Engarde's dressing room... This is our client's room.\n???:\nMay I help you with something?\nPhoenix:\nUm, uh... We're...\n???:\nYou're Mr. Engarde's lawyer, correct? I gathered as much. I also looked for lawyers on my end, but to no avail.\nPhoenix:\nUm... How did you know I'm his lawyer...?\n???:\nYou were just saying that he is your client. In a situation like this, the only person who would use such a word would be his lawyer.\nPearl:\nWow...\n???:\nIt's simple deduction, really. The trial is tomorrow, and Mr. Engarde's situation is looking rather grim. So you came here, one stop in your mad dash, to find clues to build his case, correct?\nPhoenix:\nWell, you're not totally right, but you're not totally off either.\nPearl:\nIt's really not the time to be showing off, Mr. Nick.\nAndrews:\nI am Adrian Andrews. I hate to waste time, so let's get down to business.\nPhoenix:\nA-Alright... (She may be of small stature, but appearances can be deceiving...)\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelCorrida's Hotel Room\nPearl:\nMr. Nick... Where are we...?\nPhoenix:\nWe're in Mr. Juan Corrida's room, Pearls.\nPearl:\nMr. Corrida...?\nPhoenix:\nThe victim... Which makes this the crime scene, too.\nGumshoe:\nOh! It's you! So!? What's happened!? The kidnapper! Has he contacted you again!?\nPhoenix:\nNot yet. He probably won't until we win Mr. Engarde's acquittal.\nGumshoe:\nUmm... You doing OK, pal? Hanging in there?\nPhoenix:\n(I just want Maya to be alright...)\nPearl:\n...\nGumshoe:\nWe don't have a lot of time left, but I'm going to help you as much as I can, pal.\nPhoenix:\nCan you do that? Even if we want to look around the crime scene...?\nGumshoe:\nJust this once... \"Special circumstances\" right, pal? I'll even tell you everything I know. But you've gotta keep quiet. It's my neck on the line here.\nPhoenix:\nThank you.\nGumshoe:\nOh, that's right. I got you guys a map of the hotel, pal. Here you go, little missy.\nPearl:\nWow, you're giving it to me!? Thank you!\nGumshoe:\nHa ha. Wouldn't want you to get lost in a hotel too big for its own good.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! I got a map!\nPhoenix:\nThat's great, Pearls!\nPearl:\n... Um... But Mr. Nick, I can't read what it says...\nHotel Guidemap added to the Court Record.\nAfter clearing all Talk options, examining guitar case, and presenting Wine Glass:\n...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*...\nPearl:\nWh-What's that beeping noise, Mr. Nick...?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I've heard this sound somewhere before...)\nGumshoe:\nIt's Ms. von Karma...\nPearl:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nFor some reason, whenever I hear that sound, she pops out of nowhere and whips me! (Changed from [Whenever I hear that sound, for some reason, she pops out of nowhere and whips me!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Come to think of it, that's exactly what happen [sic] the last time...) (Changed from [Come to think of it, that did happen the last time...] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nS-Sorry! I've gotta make myself scarce! Later, pal! Eowww!\nvon Karma:\nAt last, you reveal your true nature... Mr. Phoenix Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(*gulp* Would it be too much to ask for you to be nice to me for a change...?)\nvon Karma:\nSo you're the type to steal information from pitifully hopeless detectives! That's very dishonorable of you!\nPhoenix:\n(Owww!)\nvon Karma:\nHey! Don't you dare run away, Scruffy McTrenchcoat!\nGumshoe:\nAh!\nvon Karma:\nI didn't think the detectives of this country could be this pitiful...\nGumshoe:\nUwaah!\nvon Karma:\nDetective! Come over here for a second!\nGumshoe:\nYeooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow!\nvon Karma:\n...Hmph. I feel better knowing at least you were man enough to face your punishment.\nPhoenix:\n(He was so scared, he just froze up on the spot...)\nvon Karma:\nMr. Phoenix Wright! You... You have soiled my perfect prosecution record. I'll never forget that. This time... Victory is mine!\nPhoenix:\n... Victory is yours? Is that all this means to you...?\nvon Karma:\nWh-What...!?\nPhoenix:\n...\nvon Karma:\n... H-Hmph! Come, Scruff-face! The investigation briefing is about to begin. (Changed from [Come, Scruff-face! The investigation briefing is about to begin.] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir!\nvon Karma:\nThis isn't over yet... I swear on my family's honor!\nPhoenix:\n(Ow! What did she throw at me NOW...!? (Changed from [Ow! Now what did she throw at me...!?] in the original release) What is this...?)\nGumshoe:\n...Well, I guess this means I've gotta get back to the precinct now, pal. If you ever need me, come down to the Criminal Affairs Department, alright? And if you can, try not to let Ms. von Karma see you...\nAfter visiting Enguarde's Hotel Room:\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelViola Hall\nPowers:\nOh, Mr. Wright! How are you?\nPhoenix:\nAh, Mr. Powers. Have you been here the entire time?\nPowers:\nYeah. People connected to the murder aren't allowed to go home, let alone leave...\nDetention Center\nHotel Lobby\nAfter clearing all Talk options, examining guitar case, and presenting Wine Glass in Gatewater Hotel - Corrida's Hotel Room:\nMarch 21Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept.\nPearl:\nHmm, it doesn't look like Mr. Scruffy Detective is here...\nPhoenix:\n(Great, now even Pearls is calling him \"Scruffy\"... Thanks, Franziska.) They said something about an investigation briefing earlier, right? Why don't we come back and try again later when they're done...\nPearl:\nOK... I guess that's all we can do, right Mr. Nick?\nHallway\nAfter clearing \"Enguarde's past\" Talk option in Gatewater Hotel - Hotel Lobby and clearing \"Big scoop\" Talk option upon breaking Psyche-Locks in Gatewater Hotel - Hallway:\nMarch 21Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept.\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe said they had an investigation briefing...\nPearl:\nYeah... Oh! He's back!\nGumshoe:\nHey, so you came, pal.\nPhoenix:\nWhy the blunt greeting?\nGumshoe:\nUm, because there's nothing to be friendly or happy about.\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean by that?\nGumshoe:\nWell, things look perfect this time around. The evidence and testimony are airtight...\nPhoenix:\nBut... But... We can't just roll over and die! We have to stay positive!\nGumshoe:\nShe was the victim's manager and was also Ms. Adrian Andrews' mentor. It's been two years since her suicide, and now those two are linked again by another death. Or maybe it's just a coincidence...? But... Waaah!\nvon Karma:\nI'm getting sick of dealing with one foolish idiot after another...\nGumshoe:\nM-M-Ms. von Karma!\nvon Karma:\nYou can't seem to stop allying yourself with the enemy, can you? I don't need a traitor in my midst.\nGumshoe:\nY-Y-You don't... You don't mean...\nvon Karma:\nI do. Scruffy. You have thirty minutes to get out of here. You are no longer needed. Good bye.\nPearl:\nTh-That's...\nGumshoe:\nW-Wait... Please wait, sir! If I don't get this month's pay, I'll star--\nvon Karma:\nQuiet! If it weren't for traitors like you...\n???:\n\"I would've won.\" Is that what you want to say?\nvon Karma:\n...! Wh-Who!?\nPhoenix:\nThat voice... E-Edgeworth!!\nEdgeworth:\nIt's been a long time... Wright.\nPearl:\nTh-This person... This is Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat am I going to do with you...? Still blaming others when things go wrong? You haven't changed a bit, Franziska.\nvon Karma:\n... ... ... Y... You... How dare you show your face to me without a shred of shame upon it!? You've soiled the Von Karma name, dragged it through the mud... (Changed from [You've soiled the Von Karma name and dragged it through the mud.] in the original release) You even ran away with your tail between your legs like the ill-bred dog you are! (Changed from [Run away with your tail between your legs like the ill-bred dog you are!] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\nAre you talking about the Von Karma family creed? \"To be perfect in every way...\" Then let's hear it, Franziska. How are things going? I hear you are having a rough time maintaining perfection in this country.\nvon Karma:\nY-You!\nEdgeworth:\nYou seem to be getting crushed under the weight of it all. That's why I came back.\nvon Karma:\nKeep your assumptions to yourself! I... I haven't given in yet! I won't lose! This case is mine! I'll never hand it over to you! Never! Mr. Phoenix Wright! I will see you tomorrow... In court. It will be a clinical lesson on the meaning of \"total victory\"!\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. Still the same wild mare she always was.\nPhoenix:\n...\nDetention Center\nAfter clearing \"Celeste Inpax\" Talk option in Police Station - Criminal Affairs Dept.:\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelEngarde's Hotel Room\nPearl:\n...Hmm, looks like Ms. Andrews isn't here.\nPhoenix:\nThat's not good. I still have a few questions I want to ask her...\nPearl:\nAnd she has that Psyche-Lock on her heart, right?\nPhoenix:\n...Well, we don't have much of a choice. I guess we'll have to come back later.\nAfter clearing \"\"Dependent nature\"\" Talk option in Police Station - Criminal Affairs Dept.:\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelEngarde's Hotel Room\nPearl:\n...Oh! Ms. Andrews is here. But it looks like she's talking with someone...\nPhoenix:\n(That's... Franziska von Karma!)\nPearl:\nMs. von Karma...?\nvon Karma:\nWhat are you doing here!?\nPhoenix:\nUm, well, you see... I'm his lawyer, so...\nvon Karma:\nYou've got some nerve, following me around...\nPhoenix:\nFollowing you...?\nPearl:\nTh-That's you, Ms. von Karma! You're the one doing the following!\nPhoenix:\nPearls...\nPearl:\nYou're always following after that Mr. Detective with the little beard!\nvon Karma:\n...Me? Following after Scruffy...? Don't make me laugh. Let me show you something interesting... little girl. (Changed from [I'll show you something interesting... little girl.] in the original release)\n...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*...\nPearl:\nWh-What is that?\nvon Karma:\nAn electromagnetic receiver. I planted a tracking device on that detective. And with this, I know that fool's every move.\nPhoenix:\n(So that noise we heard was this receiver... I feel really sorry for poor Detective Gumshoe now...)\nvon Karma:\nNow then... Let's stop wasting time. Adrian Andrews!\nAndrews:\nY-Yes...?\nvon Karma:\nThink hard about what we just discussed. Understood!?\nAndrews:\nA-Alright... ...\nPhoenix:\n(What were those two talking about...?)\nPearl:\nMs. Andrews... She seems a little dazed, doesn't she?\nAndrews:\n...\nAndrews:\nIt's true. I am a woman who can only live in insecurity. I'm physically small, and I don't really have a lot of self-confidence. I've pushed against all that, though... I've tried to live strongly. I never wanted anyone to find out the truth...\nPearl:\nMs. Andrews...\nAndrews:\nThis one thing... It's the one thing I wanted to take with me to the grave... It was my secret. Mine and mine alone.\nPhoenix:\nI... I'm sorry.\nAndrews:\nYou probably think I'm a worthless human being right now, don't you?\nPhoenix:\nPlease, Ms. Andrews. All I want to know is the truth.\nAndrews:\nAfter Celeste passed away, I heard that someone had hidden her suicide note... And that someone was Juan Corrida. Celeste... Without her... Without her, I became scared. Everything... Everyone seemed like they were out to get me.\nPhoenix:\nSo you got close to Mr. Corrida to recover her suicide note, correct?\nAndrews:\n... Looks like that tabloid reported the truth after all. Ironic, isn't it?\nPhoenix:\nWell, like they say, where there's smoke, there's fire.\nAndrews:\nAnd if they purposely add fuel to the fire, they keep the celebrity world burning.\nPearl:\n...\nAndrews:\nBut as for the suicide note? I didn't and wouldn't kill anyone for it. It just doesn't suit me, that's all.\nAndrews:\n... Well, that's enough for now. I still have work to do, so...\nPhoenix:\nI understand.\nAndrews:\nOh, I have one small favor to ask. My... attempted suicide... I'd like for you to keep it a secret.\nPearl:\nMs. Andrews...\nAndrews:\nIf... If people found out about my weakness... I... I would sooner choose to die than live.\nPhoenix:\nA-A-Alright! I understand! We'll keep it a secret! (Ms. Andrews... I guess she's the overthinking type... (Changed from [Ms. Andrews... I guess she's the 'always thinking' type...] in the original release) She probably never says anything without carefully thinking it through first. (Changed from [She never says anything carelessly, it seems...] in the original release))\nAndrews:\nThank you for your discretion. (Changed from [Thank you very much.] in the original release)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick... Can I ask you something...?\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it?\nPearl:\nMs. Andrews has been playing with that card in her hand since a little while back...\nPhoenix:\n(That card...? Yeah, I guess she has...) Ms. Andrews, what is that card you're holding...?\nAndrews:\nHuh? O-Oh, this? I don't quite know. It just suddenly appeared in my handbag...\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it? It looks like... A seashell?\nAndrews:\nThat's what it looks like, doesn't it? I honestly don't remember owning this card... I wonder where I picked it up from...?\nPhoenix:\n(Her not remembering something clearly? Sounds like it would be a rare occurence.)\nAndrews:\nWell, I must be off. I leave Mr. Engarde in your \"capable\" hands.\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelHallway\nPhoenix:\nWell, I think we've gathered about all we can...\nPearl:\nWh-What about Mystic Maya? Is she alright...?\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, Pearls... She looks so worn out by all this... She hasn't slept at all, and has been walking all over the place with me today...)\nPearl:\nWhat's wrong, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nLet's go back to the office for a little while. You're really tired, right?\nPearl:\nOh, no! I'm OK. Really! ... I'm fine. I really am.\nPhoenix:\n(You don't look fine to me...)\nMarch 21Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept.\nPearl:\nThere's no one here. Everyone's gone. I wonder if the three of them went to eat together!\nPhoenix:\n...I don't think they'd ever do that. They're probably in yet another meeting.\nMarch 21Wright & Co. Law Offices\nPearl:\nSo! What now?\nPhoenix:\nWell, we did find one thing out for sure. Ms. Andrews has a motive.\nPearl:\nYou mean Ms. Inpax's suicide note...?\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. She was also the one to discover the victim's body. Clever...\n...*beep beep beep*...\nPearl:\nAh! Mr. Nick! The transceiver!\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\nHello!? Wright & Co. Law Offices! (Changed from [Hello!? This is the law office of Wright & Co!] in the original release)\n???:\n...Mr. Attorney, you're not answering a phone.\nPhoenix:\nM-Maya! Where's Maya!?\n???:\nAs I promised, I have not gone within a few feet of her this whole time. (Changed from [As I promised, I have not come within a few feet of her this whole time.] in the original release)\nPearl:\nPhew...\n???:\n...Which is why, I suppose, she is absolutely famished.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!?\n???:\nSo I suggest you win a quick acquittal, my friend. At any cost. Wouldn't you agree?\nPhoenix:\nWait! Maya! Let me hear her!\n???:\n...Very well.\nMaya:\n...Ask my...!\nPhoenix:\nMaya! Is that you!?\nMaya:\n...Sis... Ask my sis!\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\nMaya! Maya! ...Dammit! He cut me off!\nPearl:\nMystic Maya said, \"Ask my sis,\" didn't she?\nPhoenix:\n\"Sis\"...? What does she mean by that...?\nCome on, Phoenix! *sigh* You're a hopeless one...\nPhoenix:\nUm, s-sorry... ...Ack!! Mia!\nMia:\nI have a message from Maya, so come, ask me anything you want about her.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nMia:\nMaya is locked up in a very dark place right now. I'll tell you everything I heard when I was with her.\nPhoenix:\nWhen you were with her...\nDate: ??? Time: ???Location: ???\nMaya:\nNnngh... I'm starving... I could really go for some apple pie... I mean, at a time like this, sweets are the only way to go! I have to stay positive! He promised he wasn't going to kill me! I'm not going to die! (Sis... I wonder if you're with Nick right now...)\nAfter examining door and card:\nMaya:\nAh! That's it! This shell card! If I use this, maybe I can get the door open! This might be my key out of here! I had a feeling this card might be useful... I'm such a genius! Alright. Now if you'll excuse me, Mr. Kidnapper...\n...*click*...\nMaya:\n(I did it!) OK... Now I'm getting the heck out of here! (I shouldn't keep Nick waiting... Or worried.)\nTo be continued."

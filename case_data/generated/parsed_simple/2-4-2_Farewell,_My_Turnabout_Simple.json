Will it be last year's runner-up, Jammin' Ninja!? Or maybe Captain Saipan all the way from the lovely tropical island of Saipan!? I see the students of a certain Starry School are raring to win! And Global Hero Onyankopon doesn't want to go home without the prize! We hope Lady Luck is with all our heroes tonight! And now! The winner of the third annual Hero of Heroes Grand Prix... IS ME!!\nWhoooooooooa! The true hero of the night has appeared in our midst! It looks like this year's Grand Prix goes to this fantastic warrior! The Nickel Samurai! Too bad, Jammin' Ninja. Looks like the title eluded you again this year!\nMarch 20, 7:42 PMGatewater HotelViola Hall\nMaya:\nAlright! Yes! Did you hear that, Nick!? Did you!? The Nickel Samurai! He did it!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, he sure did... *sigh* I'm getting too old for this.\nPowers:\nAh, I'm proud of the guy for doing the series justice.\nPearl:\nU-Um... So the person everyone was cheering for... I guess he got the prize?\nMaya:\nYup! You know who we're talking about, right Pearly? \"The Nickel Samurai\"!\nPearl:\nNo. Every Sunday, I only watch the Educational Channel's \"Kids' Masterpiece Theatre\".\nMaya:\nOK, that's it! From now on, it's \"The Nickel Samurai\"! All the kids watch it!\nPearl:\nDo you like \"The Nickel Samurai\" too, Mr. Nick?\nMaya:\nNah, Nick's an old fart, so he's not allowed to watch it anymore.\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. But I do like \"Kids' Masterpiece Theatre\".\nMaya:\nHey, I didn't know you were so young at heart, Nick!\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! You're a grown-up! You're not allowed to watch it anymore! You're supposed to act your age and have interests that match. ...It's very important.\nMaya:\nAw, give it a rest, Pearly!\nPowers:\nLooks like I made the right choice in inviting everyone here. I'm glad you're all having a good time.\nMaya:\nAaaaah... It's like a dream!\nPowers:\nToo bad for the Jammin' Ninja, though. Last year, he lost to The Pink Princess: Warrior of Little Olde Tokyo. I thought this might be his year...\nMaya:\nYeah... Oh, hey, did anyone else think that the Jammin' Ninja was a bit different today?\nPearl:\nDifferent? What do you mean?\nMaya:\nUm, well, he wasn't carrying his bright red guitar.\nPowers:\nHey, you're right! Strange he'd walk around without his signature guitar.\nPhoenix:\n(...*sigh* I will never understand these people and their shows...) Anyway, Mr. Powers, thank you very much for tonight.\nPowers:\nA-Aw, it was nothing... I owe you one, so it's just my way of saying thanks.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Come on! It's time to get going to the lobby! There's a post-ceremony stage show that's supposed to start real soon.\nPowers:\nAnd then, I heard there's going to be a press conference after that.\nPhoenix:\nA press conference? Is he going to make a speech about winning this year's prize?\nPowers:\nUh, well, not exactly... Something about the Nickel Samurai confessing something.\nPhoenix:\nConfessing...? Sounds pretty serious.\nMaya:\nArgh! Nick! COME ON! You don't want us to be the last ones there, do you!?\nPearl:\nYeah, Mr. Nick! Do you!?\nPhoenix:\n(Why me...? The show doesn't even start for another 20 minutes...)\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHallway\nPhoenix:\nWow, what is with this place? Looks like I've stumbled into Oz or something. Way in the back, there's a sign for the bathroom. Maybe I should visit it while I can before the show starts... (Changed from [I bet we have a little time to look around before the show starts...] in the original release)\nViola Hall (after clearing all Talk options in Gatewater Hotel - Viola Hall and visiting Hallway)\nPowers:\nSounds like the post-ceremony show is about to start.\nMaya:\nAlright! I'm so pumped! I wonder if he's going to show off his special move today? \"Nickel Samurai Smelting!\"\nPowers:\nActually, what I'm interested in most is the press conference.\nMaya:\nYou mean the \"big confession\" the Nickel Samurai's going to make after the show? So what is it? Don't you know what it's about, Mr. Powers?\nPowers:\nUh, well, I'm not the Steel Samurai anymore, so I don't have any idea.\nMaya:\nBah.\nPowers:\nS-Sorry. Ah, so I guess you are all going to the press conference then?\nMaya:\nYeah, of course!\nPowers:\nIf that's the case, then here, take these tickets so you can get in.\nPress Conference Ticket added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nThank you very much. Well, let's get going to the lobby.\nPearl:\nIt looks like it's over this way, Mr. Nick!\nMaya:\nOK! For great justice!\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Only a really gaudy hotel would have such a large, gaudy lobby to match.\nPearl:\nAh, I think they're going to have the post-ceremony show over there.\nPhoenix:\nThey're using a compact stage, I see.\nMaya:\nOoh... I'm all ready to use my special \"Samurai Power\".\nPhoenix:\n(Maya looks like she's ready to start a fight...)\nPA Notice:\nYour attention please, your attention please. The Nickel Samurai's Post-Ceremony Stage Show will not be held tonight due to unforeseen circumstances.\nMaya:\nWHAAAT!? WHYYYYY!?\nPhoenix:\nOww! You didn't have to pinch me! Pinch yourself if you don't believe it!\nPA Notice:\nWe are asking for everyone's cooperation at this time. So please stay where you are. ...This is a special request from the police.\nPearl:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nP-Police? Did they just say the police?\nPowers:\nD-Do you want me to go check out what's going on?\nPhoenix:\nUm, wait, I'll come with you...\n???:\nFreeze! You two! Didn't you hear the announcement just now!? It just finished telling you not to move!\nMaya:\nTh-That voice... I've heard that voice somewhere before...\n???:\nHonestly, youth these days can't be bothered to listen to other people when they talk! Just the other day it was the same thing! There was a small footbridge with a sign next to it that said, \"Beware, Bridge Out!\" And along comes a snot-nosed little punk kid right up to the bridge. I tried to tell the boy the bridge was out and it was dangerous, but would he listen!? No, of course not! He said he'd be careful and only walk on the \"in\" part of the bridge since the \"out\" part is what was dangerous! I am not kidding you here! The kid said that and really meant it! WELL! I really let him have it then, and knocked him clear off of that bridge! Honestly, kids these days don't know right from wrong, I tell you!\nPowers:\nThis non-stop chatter...\nPhoenix:\nI-It can't be... ...Ms. Oldbag?\n???:\n...\nOldbag:\nWhat is it, you young whipper-snappers!? Do I know you!? ...Wait. YOU! You're Powers, aren't you!?\nPowers:\nY-Yeah. Um, about what happened back then...\nOldbag:\nYou didn't even get nominated this year, did you? (Changed from [You didn't get nominated last year either, did you?] in the original release) Oh, that's right. You're doing that children's exercise program, trying to play nice.\nPowers:\nAh, yeah, that's me. Thankfully I still have a job...\nOldbag:\nI love that show, and you're a hoot! You're the \"big brother\" character, right? Yes, even with your face covered by a mask, I know. You're that giant rabbit! (Changed from [Yes, even with your face covered by a mask, I know. You ended up with a rabbit face.] in the original release) What a work of art, but that's how it is, you know? I mean, if you didn't wear the mask, who knows how many TVs you'd break? Really, and shame on those kids exercising around you. They're getting what they deserve. This is why I thought you shouldn't be anywhere...\nPhoenix:\nUm... What are you doing here?\nOldbag:\nLook at my uniform and tell me you can't tell I'm a member of security!\nMaya:\nBut that outfit...\nOldbag:\nAnnoying, noisy brats get the blaster!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nMaya:\n...Hey, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What is it? I don't like that devilish smile playing on your lips...\nMaya:\nLet's make like we're going to the bathroom, and check things out!\nPhoenix:\nN-No way. The police told us not go [sic] anywhere, remember?\nMaya:\nHuh!? How B-O-R-I-N-G! You're such a boring guy! You've got no motivation! No spirit!\nPearl:\nHuh? What? What's going on? Are you giving Mystic Maya trouble again, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Not you too, Pearls... Please don't stick your little nose into this one...)\nMaya:\nSo listen to this, Pearly. This one time at lawyer camp, Nick...\nPhoenix:\nO-OK! I get it! Let's go take a look.\nMaya:\nYay! I know you couldn't say no to me, Nick!\nPearl:\nThat's right. You'd walk over miles of hot coals for Mystic Maya, wouldn't you Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(That would be EVERY time we work a case together...)\nMaya:\nWell, what are we waiting for? Let's go already! You can come along too, Pearly.\nPearl:\nGoody! I get to come! I get to come!\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelViola Hall\nPhoenix:\nThere's nothing really out of the ordinary here...\nPearl:\nAre you looking for the \"in-si-dent\" that the old lady was talking about? (Changed from [Are you looking for the 'something' that the old lady was talking about?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nDoesn't look like it happened here. Well, we'd better go look somewhere else.\nMaya:\nAlright! Then, let's try...\nBellboy:\nExcuse me.\nMaya:\nAck!\nBellboy:\nAre you by chance, Ms. Maya Fey?\nMaya:\nUm, yeah... That's me.\nBellboy:\nYou have a phone call waiting for you at the front desk.\nMaya:\nA call? I wonder if it's someone from Kurain Village...\nPearl:\nWhat's wrong, Mystic Maya?\nMaya:\nOh, nothing. You guys go on ahead and I'll be right there, OK? (Changed from [Oh, nothing. I'll just go on ahead to check it out, OK?] in the original release)\nPearl:\nOK.\nBellboy:\nRight this way, Ms. Fey.\nPearl:\nLet's go look somewhere else now, Mr. Nick.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, OK.\nPearl:\nThis is a little exciting... And a little scary...\nHotel Lobby\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHallway\nI. TOLD. YOU. I get people the info they want! Which means that I've got a right to know!\nNope! Don't care who you are, pal, we're still investigating, so you can't go in!\nWhat's yer problem!? Just ya wait! It'll be all over the morning paper! \"Scruffy Detective's Secret Scandal Revealed!\" You'll see! I'll git ya back!\nPearl:\nThose two sound pretty serious...\nPhoenix:\n(That southern accent can only mean...)\nHey, Wright!\nPhoenix:\nH-Hey... Lotta...\nLotta:\nCome on, do a gal a favor and tell this cop I'm just doin' my job and I've got rights...\nGumshoe:\nAh, YOU!\nPhoenix:\nAh... Detective Gumshoe...\nGumshoe:\nHey pal, help a guy out! Tell her that only the police are allowed here! This is the scene of a murder, so she should leave this to us pros...\nPearl:\nA... A murder!?\nGumshoe:\nAw, shoot! Me and my big mouth!\nLotta:\nSee! I knew it! My gut instinct told me so! I always trust my gut! A murder, it said! And that's what it is! A genuine murder!\nGumshoe:\nH-Hey, wait...\nYeehaw, a murder! Of a big star, no less!\nGumshoe:\nOh, man... I'm in trouble now...\nAfter clearing \"The victim\" and \"Arrested?\" Talk options in Gatewater Hotel - Hallway:\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nPowers:\nHey! So what's going on, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like Juan Corrida has been killed.\nPowers:\nWh-Wh-What!? Juan is... He's...!?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like he was murdered... And a suspect was arrested. That suspect is Mr. Matt Engarde.\nPowers:\nY-You're joking, right!?\nPhoenix:\nNope. They arrested the Nickel Samurai on suspicion of murdering the Jammin' Ninja.\nPowers:\nOoogh... Not again... I feel sick.\nPearl:\n\"Again\"...?\nPhoenix:\n...About a year ago, something just like this happened, Pearls.\nPowers:\nI still can't believe... No way... No way Matt would...\nPhoenix:\n(...? What's Mr. Powers got in his hand...?)\nPowers:\n...Oh, before I forget... This... This is for you, Mr. Wright. I got this from the bellboy that came by earlier.\nRadio Transceiver received from Mr. Powers.\nPhoenix:\n...For me...? But why?\nPowers:\nI don't know. All he said was it was for Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPearl:\nUm... I was just wondering... Where's Mystic Maya? She's been gone a long time.\nPhoenix:\n(Now that she mentions it, she was only going to answer a phone call...)\nPearl:\nMaybe she got lost. I'll take a quick look around for her.\n...*beep beep beep*...\nPhoenix:\nAck!\nPearl:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Nick!?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? I... I'm not sure... (It's coming from this transceiver...) (Changed from [Did this transceiver just...?] in the original release)\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, hello? Wright here...\n???:\nIs this Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney?\nPhoenix:\nAnd you are...!?\n???:\nYou don't need to know who I am. I think you have other things to be concerning yourself with... Such as...\nMaya:\nHeeelp! Niiiiick!\nPearl:\nM-Mystic Maya!\nPhoenix:\nMaya...?\n???:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Wouldn't you agree that the more important issue is the fate of the girl?\nPhoenix:\n(Her fate? Does he mean what I think he means...?) Maya! Where are you!? Are you hurt!?\n???:\nCome now. Don't fall apart on me yet.\nPhoenix:\n(Th-This... No! This can't be!)\n???:\nNow that I have your attention, Mr. Attorney, I have a modest proposal for you. If you do what I require, then I will return to you your valuable \"item\" unharmed. ...What is this called again in your fancy lawyer terms?\nPhoenix:\n...\"Kidnapping for ransom\"...\n???:\nYes, that's it. This is a kidnapping.\nPearl:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Mystic Maya! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!\nPhoenix:\n(M-My sight... Everything's fading away... Maya... Maya... Maya's been kidnapped!)\n???:\n...--re you there? Mr. Attorney, are you there? (Changed from [You there? Mr. Wright, are you there?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nH-How much!? How much do you want!?\n???:\nVery good, Mr. Attorney. I'm glad you have such a good grasp of the situation.\nPhoenix:\nHurry up and state your condition! And then return Maya--\n???:\nMoney is not what I seek.\nPhoenix:\n...What?\n???:\nWhat I want is a certain verdict. I would like a complete acquittal.\nPhoenix:\nComplete acquittal!? Wh-What in the world have you done to need...!?\n???:\nI am not the person you will be representing.\nPhoenix:\nWhat...?\n???:\nYou are currently at the Gatewater Hotel, are you not? And I know that a murder has just taken place there.\nPhoenix:\nJuan Corrida was killed, and the suspect is Matt Engarde...\n???:\nYou are, as expected, quite on top of things, Mr. Attorney. Now then. What I want is very simple. I want you to obtain a complete acquittal for Matt Engarde.\nPhoenix:\nM-Matt Engarde? But why?\n???:\nHe did not kill anyone. I can attest to that. However...\nPhoenix:\nH-However!? However what!?\n???:\nHowever, someone is framing him for the murder. A very smart someone who is setting him up to take the fall...\nPhoenix:\n... (If I agree and do what he wants, can I believe he'll keep his end of the bargain!?)\n???:\nYou are, of course, at liberty to take me at my word or not. (Changed from [You are, of course, at liberty to believe me or not.] in the original release) However, there is one thing you can take as fact. Right now, your very precious \"item\" is with me, in my possession.\nMaya:\nMmngnhhh... Heeelp!... Nngmph... NIIIICK!\nPhoenix:\nMaya!\n???:\nYou have two days. Of course, tonight, he will be in questioning with the police. But the trial is in two days. At that trial, you will win a not guilty verdict. Remember, you only have one chance. One chance, Mr. Attorney. (Changed from [Remember, you only have one chance. One chance, Mr. Wright.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nO-One...!? Y-You expect me to get a not guilty in one trial day!?\n???:\nYes, exactly. I don't believe I was wrong in choosing you, so don't let me down.\nPhoenix:\nAagh!\n???:\nOh, yes, that's right. Now that I am playing the role of the kidnapper, I can't pass up this chance to say, \"And don't even think about callin' the cops!\" ...Hmm, not great, but you get the idea.\nPhoenix:\nD-Dammit! Who... Who the hell are you!?\n???:\nAlright, I'll tell you that much. My name is... ...De Killer.\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick! Wh-Where is Mystic Maya!?\nPhoenix:\n...She's been kidnapped.\nPearl:\nN-No... ... It's all my fault! If only I had gone with Mystic Maya...!\nPhoenix:\nIt's not your fault, Pearls.\nPearl:\nBut it is! It is! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaaaa! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\nPowers:\nMr. Wright... I think we... I think we should tell the police what it's [sic] going on...!\nPhoenix:\n(No! We can't do that! If we do, who knows what will happen to Maya...)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! What about the detective we saw earlier...?\nPhoenix:\n(...Detective Gumshoe!) Yes, that's it! Wait here, and I'll be right back!\nPowers:\nAlright! I'll take care of Pearl while you're away!\nHallway\nGumshoe:\nWHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!? RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANSOM!?\nPhoenix:\nShhh! Not so loud! ...The ransom is complete acquittal for Matt Engarde.\nGumshoe:\nWait, the deal is \"complete acquittal\" in exchange for Maya, you mean...? Then this means Matt Engarde is obviously the killer, pal! No doubt about it!\nPhoenix:\nBut the guy said that Mr. Engarde is innocent...\nGumshoe:\nYou really believe what a KIDNAPPER tells you, pal!?\nPhoenix:\n(I guess he has a point... If Engarde is really innocent, then why the kidnapping?)\nGumshoe:\nAnd on top of everything else, there's all this evidence we keep finding.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nThe forensics team's having a field day back there. (Changed from [The guys with the eagle eyes are really lapping it up like they just caught a huge fish.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nGumshoe:\nBut it's strange. There's so much evidence that it feels like something's wrong.\nPhoenix:\nThere's too much evidence? Is that possible? (Actually, didn't the kidnapper say something about Engarde being \"set-up\"...?)\nGumshoe:\nAnyway, looks like you won't be leaving here tonight, pal. Just sit tight and cooperate with the investigation. Tomorrow you can start yours.\nPhoenix:\n...A-Alright... (Isn't there another way...?)\nGumshoe:\nWe've also got to be careful about pushing the kidnapper the wrong way.\nPhoenix:\nYou're right...\nDate: ??? Time: ???Location: ???\nMaya:\nNnngh... Oww, my head... (Wh-Where... Where am I!? I wonder if I'm still in that hotel... Wh-What happened to me...?) Nick... Pearly! ... (Come on, you guys. This isn't funny anymore...)\n...*ka-click*...\n???:\nI see you have awoken.\nMaya:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Wh-Wh-Wh-Who are you!?\n???:\nMe? ...I am known as \"De Killer\".\nMaya:\n\"D-De Killer\"!? You mean like an \"ASSASSIN\"!? (I... I'm too young to die!)\n???:\nDon't worry. You are not my target. ...For now anyway.\nMaya:\nA-Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Nick! Nick! Where are you!? ...Help me...\n???:\nYes, that's right. Only one person can save you now, and that is Mr. Phoenix Wright.\nMaya:\n...Huh? Wh-What? Nick... Nick's going to save me...?\n???:\nCalm down and be a good girl. Think of this as a business transaction.\nMaya:\nA... A business transaction?\n???:\nI am going to contact him now. I hope you'll cooperate and play your assigned role well.\nMaya:\n...Nick... What's going to happen to me? Nick... Pearly... (Changed from [What's going to happen to me? Nick... Pearls...] in the original release) ...Sis...\n???:\n... Is this Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney? ... You don't need to know who I am. I think you have other things to be concerning yourself with... Such as...\nMarch 21, 8:11 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nPearl:\nGood morning!\nPhoenix:\nAh, morning, Pearls.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Mr. Nick! Come on! Let's hurry and go see Mr. Engarde!\nPhoenix:\nWe have to wait a bit, Pearls. Visiting hours don't start until 9 AM, so...\nPearl:\nOh, I see. Ah, Mystic Maya! If only... If only I had gone with you... (Changed from [Ah, Mystic Maya! If only... If only I went with you that time...] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Pearls... She's been like this since last night... We managed to get home somehow, yesterday evening... Thanks to Detective Gumshoe gently holding her by the hand and leading her here... But by the looks of it, I don't think Pearls got any sleep at all last night.)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Mystic Maya... She's alright, right!?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, she's alright. Either way, I'm going to save her. You can trust me on that.\nPearl:\nPlease... Please... Help her...\nPhoenix:\n(I'm only able to stay this calm and collected... Because Pearls is doing the crying for the both of us...)\nMarch 21, 8:57 AMDetention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\n(We couldn't wait for visiting hours to start, so Pearls and I came down here early... To visit one Nickel Samurai, charged with the murder of the Jammin' Ninja...)\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nG-Good morning. How are you today?\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nI know this situation might be a little tough for you...\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nUm... We're...\nEngarde:\nOh, sorry dude...\nPhoenix:\n...?\nEngarde:\nI already signed up...\nPhoenix:\nE-Excuse me...?\nEngarde:\nI already have life insurance. I signed up a long time ago cause my job is, you know...\nPhoenix:\n... Oh! No no no... We're not insurance salespeople!\nEngarde:\nReally...? Dude, I really don't need that right now either.\nPhoenix:\n...?\nEngarde:\nFire extinguishers. I mean, this building isn't my house, so...\nPhoenix:\n... No no no... We're not here to sell you fire extinguishers either! I'm a lawyer. My name is Phoenix Wright.\nEngarde:\nA lawyer...? ... Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask my manager, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nThe Nickel Samurai sure is a strange person, isn't he?\nPhoenix:\n(I think \"strange\" is an understatement.)\nEngarde:\nSorry about that. You're just in time.\nPhoenix:\nHuh!?\nEngarde:\nYou're a lawyer dude, right? My manager's looking for a good one right now, so how about it?\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick! This is our chance!\nPhoenix:\n(I have to make him let me take his case! I have to!)\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Press Conference Ticket and Radio Transceiver:\nEngarde:\n... ...Well, dude, I think it's about time for me to get going.\nPhoenix:\nPlease, wait! ...I really need to take your case!\nEngarde:\nThere's always other people in need of a lawyer, right? Want me to introduce you to a few?\nPearl:\nPlease! Please let Mr. Nick represent you!\nEngarde:\nMan, oh man. Lawyers these days. Now you dudes use kids to pull in clients, too?\nPhoenix:\nIf you don't take me as your lawyer, then De Killer is going to...!\nEngarde:\n... Wait... What did you just say?\nPhoenix:\n\"De Killer\"...\nEngarde:\nD-De Killer!?\nPhoenix:\n(...What's he doing? He looks like he's mulling something over...)\nEngarde:\n... Alright, dude. I accept your terms.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEngarde:\nI'll let you represent me in court.\nPearl:\nW-We did it! We did it, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nUh, yeah... (I don't feel any better for it... And he doesn't look too happy either...)\nEngarde:\nGo ahead, ask me anything. I'll help out as much as I can...\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\n... (...I guess this is about all I'm going to get out of him...)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah?\nPearl:\nLet's ask one last thing. Let's test Mr. Engarde to see if he really is innocent or not...\nPhoenix:\nW-We can do that...?\nPearl:\nYes. If you use this...\nPhoenix:\n(Maya's Magatama!)\nPearl:\nHe won't be able to hide any secrets from you, Mr. Nick. I'm sure of it.\nPhoenix:\n(I get it...!) ...Mr. Engarde, I'd like to ask you one more question. Please answer me honestly.\nEngarde:\nWhat is it, dude?\nPhoenix:\nDid you kill Mr. Juan Corrida?\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nPlease put the phone away and answer this question yourself.\nEngarde:\nAlright. Just so we're clear, dude, I didn't kill anyone, and that includes Juan Corrida, OK?\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nWell, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nNothing. Not a chain or lock in sight.\nPearl:\nWhich means... I think it is alright to trust him.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, it does appear that way. Well, at least I can breathe a sigh of relief knowing my client is innocent.)\nEngarde:\nUm... The trial's tomorrow, right? I'm counting on you, dude.\nTo be continued.\nMarch 21, 11:34 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nWell, at least we were able to get Mr. Matt Engarde as our client. And we know that he didn't do it... Which is very important...\nPearl:\nSo! So now what should we do!?\nPhoenix:\nWell, the trial is tomorrow. And we only get this one chance. There's only one way to prove Mr. Engarde's innocence. We have to find the real killer.\nPearl:\nOK! Then let's start looking!\nMarch 21Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nEngarde:\nAh, the lawyer dude. So what did you find out?\nPhoenix:\nUm, well... I'm still in the middle of investigating...\nEngarde:\nI see. ...But I've already told you everything I know, dude.\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nOldbag:\nHey! What do you think you're doing!? You can't come in without...\nPearl:\nGood morning.\nOldbag:\nHold on, it's YOU! What is going on around here!?\nPhoenix:\nU-Uh... Um...\nOldbag:\nI heard poor Juan was killed. Is that true!? It's a bad rerun is what this is. Another \"Steel Samurai\" doing the most evil of deeds.\nPhoenix:\nUm, you know... That's not entirely...\nOldbag:\nI'll have you know that I was a huge fan of Juan's! Why, oh why, do all the stars I'm interested in drop one by one like flies!? It's always been that way! Ever since I was a little girl in elementary school! The class hamster was fine until it was my turn to clean its cage, and then it died! The other kids started calling me the \"Queen Reaper\". I swear that's what they dubbed me! \"Whoever you name in your evil spell dies within three minutes,\" they would taunt.\nPhoenix:\nUm... Actually, I wanted to ask you about the murder and what happened...\nOldbag:\nHmph! Don't push me, boy!\nPearl:\nUm... Mr. Nick? I... Um... I couldn't hear everything she said... because she was talking too fast...\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, could you please speak a little slower...?\nOldbag:\nDon't boss me around, you spiky-haired, smarty-pants!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelViola Hall\nPhoenix:\nLooks like the investigation is still in full swing. The hotel staff and the police are running around like a bunch of headless chickens.\nPearl:\nI wonder if we can do any investigating of our own in this kind of atmosphere...\nPhoenix:\n...Well, got to roll up the sleeves and try, I guess.\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelHallway\nLotta:\nHey!

Where are we?\nPhoenix:\nWe're in Mr. Matt Engarde's dressing room... This is our client's room.\n???:\nMay I help you with something?\nPhoenix:\nUm, uh... We're...\n???:\nYou're Mr. Engarde's lawyer, correct? I gathered as much. I also looked for lawyers on my end, but to no avail.\nPhoenix:\nUm... How did you know I'm his lawyer...?\n???:\nYou were just saying that he is your client. In a situation like this, the only person who would use such a word would be his lawyer.\nPearl:\nWow...\n???:\nIt's simple deduction, really. The trial is tomorrow, and Mr. Engarde's situation is looking rather grim. So you came here, one stop in your mad dash, to find clues to build his case, correct?\nPhoenix:\nWell, you're not totally right, but you're not totally off either.\nPearl:\nIt's really not the time to be showing off, Mr. Nick.\nAndrews:\nI am Adrian Andrews. I hate to waste time, so let's get down to business.\nPhoenix:\nA-Alright...

What's happened!? The kidnapper! Has he contacted you again!?\nPhoenix:\nNot yet. He probably won't until we win Mr. Engarde's acquittal.\nGumshoe:\nUmm... You doing OK, pal? Hanging in there?\nPhoenix:\n(I just want Maya to be alright...)\nPearl:\n...\nGumshoe:\nWe don't have a lot of time left, but I'm going to help you as much as I can, pal.\nPhoenix:\nCan you do that? Even if we want to look around the crime scene...?\nGumshoe:\nJust this once... \"Special circumstances\" right, pal? I'll even tell you everything I know. But you've gotta keep quiet. It's my neck on the line here.\nPhoenix:\nThank you.\nGumshoe:\nOh, that's right. I got you guys a map of the hotel, pal. Here you go, little missy.\nPearl:\nWow, you're giving it to me!? Thank you!\nGumshoe:\nHa ha. Wouldn't want you to get lost in a hotel too big for its own good.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! I got a map!\nPhoenix:\nThat's great, Pearls!\nPearl:\n... Um...

I am a woman who can only live in insecurity. I'm physically small, and I don't really have a lot of self-confidence. I've pushed against all that, though... I've tried to live strongly. I never wanted anyone to find out the truth...\nPearl:\nMs. Andrews...\nAndrews:\nThis one thing... It's the one thing I wanted to take with me to the grave... It was my secret. Mine and mine alone.\nPhoenix:\nI... I'm sorry.\nAndrews:\nYou probably think I'm a worthless human being right now, don't you?\nPhoenix:\nPlease, Ms. Andrews. All I want to know is the truth.\nAndrews:\nAfter Celeste passed away, I heard that someone had hidden her suicide note... And that someone was Juan Corrida. Celeste... Without her... Without her, I became scared. Everything... Everyone seemed like they were out to get me.\nPhoenix:\nSo you got close to Mr. Corrida to recover her suicide note, correct?\nAndrews:\n... Looks like that tabloid reported the truth after all. Ironic, isn't it?\nPhoenix:\nWell, like they say, where there's smoke, there's fire.\nAndrews:\nAnd if they purposely add fuel to the fire, they keep the celebrity world burning.\nPearl:\n...\nAndrews:\nBut as for the suicide note? I didn't and wouldn't kill anyone for it. It just doesn't suit me, that's all.\nAndrews:\n... Well, that's enough for now. I still have work to do, so...\nPhoenix:\nI understand.\nAndrews:\nOh, I have one small favor to ask. My... attempted suicide... I'd like for you to keep it a secret.\nPearl:\nMs. Andrews...\nAndrews:\nIf... If people found out about my weakness... I... I would sooner choose to die than live.\nPhoenix:\nA-A-Alright!

I, Miles Edgeworth, will be taking her place. The prosecution is ready... naturally.\nEdgeworth:\nMs. von Karma was shot in her right shoulder, and is currently undergoing surgery. Luckily, I have looked this case over and am familiar with the details. The prosecution seeks to prove the guilt of Mr. Matt Engarde.\nJudge:\nTh-The court acknowledges the prosecution.\nEdgeworth:\n...Wright. I finally found the answer I was struggling for on my long journey this past year. By the time this case comes to an end, you too, will know the answer.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nNow then, the prosecution would like to call its first witness... Please bring Detective Gumshoe to the witness stand!\nEdgeworth:\nWitness, your name and occupation.\nGumshoe:\nMy name's Dick Gumshoe, sir. I'm a detective down at the precinct... for now.\nJudge:\n\"For now\"...?\nGumshoe:\nAfter this trial's over... I'm supposed to turn in my badge, sir.\nPhoenix:\n(D-Detective Gumshoe...)\nEdgeworth:\nThe prosecution has no need for a depressed witness. Lift your head up and face forward like a proud officer, Detective Dick Gumshoe!\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nNow, let's have your testimony. If we want to explore the various facets of this case, we must start with that.\nMia:\nGet ready, Phoenix. This is going to be one very rough fight.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... It would have to be with Edgeworth as my opponent.  (The answer he was \"struggling\" for... Interesting... Show me this \"answer\" you finally found, Edgeworth...)\nWitness Testimony\n-- Bare Facts of the Case --\nGumshoe:\nThis murder happened after the Hero of Heroes award ceremony, sir.\nThe victim, Juan Corrida, was found dead in his hotel room.\nAfter looking into the cause of death, we believe he was definitely murdered, sir.\nAt first, we thought there was something suspicious about the empty guitar case.\nHowever, we later found out that the guitar case had nothing to do with the murder.\nJudge:\nHmm... After the award ceremony ended, the victim was alone in his room...?\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir! Both the victim and defendant went alone to their rooms, sir.\nJudge:\nI see. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- Bare Facts of the Case --\nGumshoe:\nThis murder happened after the Hero of Heroes award ceremony, sir.\nGumshoe:\nThe victim, Juan Corrida, was found dead in his hotel room.\nGumshoe:\nAfter looking into the cause of death, we believe he was definitely murdered, sir.\nGumshoe:\nAt first, we thought there was something suspicious about the empty guitar case.\nGumshoe:\nHowever, we later found out that the guitar case had nothing to do with the murder.\nMia:\nOur first order of business should be to gather more info from his testimony.\nPhoenix:\nBut there might be a trap set up for us somewhere...\nMia:\nMaybe. However, setting off traps is a part of a lawyer's job too.\nPhoenix:\nIf you say so...\nMia:\nOf course, we're supposed to escape from them too, wouldn't you say?\nAfter pressing third, fourth and fifth statements:\nEdgeworth:\nI believe that is enough. First, the victim was choked to death with his bandana. Then, after the victim was dead, the killer deliberately stabbed him with a knife.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nEdgeworth:\nWhich brings me to my next point. Why then, did the police arrest Matt Engarde...? Because there was reason enough to suspect him.\nPhoenix:\n(Here it comes... Looks like Edgeworth's back in full swing...)\nJudge:\nVery well. Detective Gumshoe, please testify about this matter.\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir!\nWitness Testimony\n-- Why Arrest Engarde? --\nGumshoe:\nMatt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other.\nThey each thought the other guy was \"in his way\". That's motive enough in my book.\nAs for evidence... There's the Jammin' Ninja's button.\nIt was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's \"hakama\".\nThe defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife.\nThe defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!\nJudge:\nHmm... So the defendant's fingerprints were found on the knife used in the stabbing.\nGumshoe:\nIt was sort of sticky on the handle, so the fingerprints came out pretty clearly, sir.\nKnife added to the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\n...And there's this button.\nJudge:\nThat was found in the defendant's clothes, was it? Hmm... And is this button also covered in blood...?\nGumshoe:\nYes, and we know that the blood on it is the victim's blood, sir.\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nJammin' Ninja's Button added to the Court Record.\nJudge:\nAll of this points very clearly to the defendant, doesn't it?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, it most certainly does, Your Honor. Ready to give in yet, Wright?\nPhoenix:\nHmph! I'll find the hole in your argument somehow!\nEdgeworth:\nYou can press as hard as you'd like. Just hurry up with your usual pointless questions.\nPhoenix:\nGrrrrrrrrr...\nCross Examination\n-- Why Arrest Engarde? --\nGumshoe:\nMatt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other.\nGumshoe:\nThey each thought the other guy was \"in his way\".

If the judge were more rash, he would've already pounded his gavel in closing.\nPhoenix:\nWe're still in a world of trouble...\nMia:\nWell, before any battle, you must find your enemy's weakness. So let's find the weakness in this testimony, no matter how small it may be, OK Phoenix?\nPhoenix:\nWait a second!\nGumshoe:\nWh-What?\nPhoenix:\nSo the basis of your argument that this was a premeditated murder is simply that my client \"bought a knife beforehand\"?\nGumshoe:\nThat's right, pal. The defendant...\nPhoenix:\n...Did not buy this knife.\nGumshoe:\nH-Huh!?\nPhoenix:\nTake a good look at the handle of this knife, and you'll know what I'm talking about.\nGumshoe:\n...Huh?\nJudge:\nIt has a \"Gatewater\" seal set into the handle...\nGumshoe:\n\"Gatewater\"...? I think I've heard that name somewhere before.\nPhoenix:\nThat's the name of the hotel. The Gatewater Hotel.\nGumshoe:\n... Uh oh.\nPhoenix:\nThe murder knife was actually property of the hotel! Which means this murder was not premeditated!\nJudge:\nYes, that is very true! This is a very big...\nEdgeworth:\nHeh heh heh...\nJudge:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nI'm sorry, but the defense is simply too careless.\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nEdgeworth:\nI think whether the crime was premeditated or not... has already been determined.\nPhoenix:\nH-How so!?\nEdgeworth:\nI admit this knife is hotel property. There is no one currently on the police force that is dumb enough not to realize this.\nGumshoe:\n...But I didn't kn... Oh... *whimper*\nEdgeworth:\nThe question is... Where did this knife come from?\nJudge:\nWh-Why that's obvious! It came from the victim, Mr. Corrida's room...\nEdgeworth:\nSorry, Your Honor, but that is incorrect. The victim ate a last meal before he was murdered. With that being the case... I would like to draw the court's attention to what is on top of the table.\nJudge:\nThere is a knife and a fork on the table! Then... Where in the world did this knife come from!?\nEdgeworth:\nIf it pleases the court... I would like for us to recall the room of the defendant, Mr. Matt Engarde. Especially what was on top of his table... There is something missing... Perhaps, it is a single knife? We investigated the leftover dishes for fingerprints, and while we were investigating, we came to the conclusion that Mr. Matt Engarde's knife was missing.\nPhoenix:\nUrk...\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Engarde had gone to the victim's room with the knife he had used during dinner. Why would he carry a knife on a visit? To kill, of course. And with that, I believe the prosecution has proven... This was a premeditated murder.\nJudge:\nAmazing, Mr. Edgeworth. Absolutely brilliant. A brilliantly clear deduction.\nMia:\nIt seems like Edgeworth had this planned from the very beginning...\nPhoenix:\n(This must be one of those \"traps\", and I just walked headlong into it!)\nJudge:\nA murder weapon with fingerprints, and a button from the victim's costume. There is quite a sizable amount of evidence here.\nEdgeworth:\nI can safely say that any further deliberation is a waste of Your Honor's time. Although... I wouldn't mind if the defense were to present evidence not yet shown to the court.\nPhoenix:\n(Evidence not yet shown...?)\nMia:\nHe means evidence that the court hasn't seen yet. In other words, new evidence.\nJudge:\nWhat does the defense have to say about this, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nUm, well...\nMia:\nPhoenix. The judge is favoring the prosecution right now. If we answer with something wrong here...\nPhoenix:\n(That gavel of his will be ringing out to the sound of our defeat!)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, do you have something important and necessary to present to this court?\nPhoenix:\nThere's one...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nOne piece of evidence that catches my attention. Something that this court has yet to see!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. I will say this one more time. I do not feel this trial needs to continue at all. ... However, I am giving you one chance... and only one.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat the judge is saying, Wright, is don't try pulling one of your usual bluffs here.\nPhoenix:\n(If I mess this up, it's curtains for all of us!)\nJudge:\nYou may now present one, and only one piece of evidence. Now then, what is this important evidence that you must show to the court?\nJudge:\nThis... is a wine glass, is it not?\nPhoenix:\nPlease look at the photo of the crime scene one more time! The scene is a mess because of the victim's struggle against his assailant. The vase was broken, his makeup is all over the floor... These were all things that were at one point, sitting on top of the dresser.\nJudge:\nHmm... Well, yes, I see your point.\nPhoenix:\nHowever! This glass, that is sitting on top of the dresser, is mysteriously untouched. The only thing that had not fallen over along with everything else is this wine glass! This piece of evidence is more than strange enough to warrant further consideration!\nJudge:\n...\nGumshoe:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nW-Well? What do you all have to say...?\nJudge:\nAh, well, yes, it is a little peculiar...\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, isn't it!? I thought it was!\nJudge:\nYou can stop looking at me with those puppy dog eyes of yours now. Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is it, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nYour opinion...\nEdgeworth:\n...You don't need my opinion. Because there is no special meaning to that glass.\nPhoenix:\n...What!?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's safe to say that the glass was set there after the crime took place. By the person who discovered the body, Adrian Andrews, for example. She could have easily been so shocked that she set the glass down without thinking.\nJudge:\nHmm... That does sound very plausible. Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(Could Ms. Andrews really have set that glass down without thinking...?)\nPhoenix:\nThe defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory. We would like to see something that proves it was Ms. Andrews who set the cup on the table!\nJudge:\nHmm... You've turned the situation on its head yet again, as usual. Mr. Edgeworth. Do you have any proof to back up your claim?\nPhoenix:\n(There's no way he has any. He's just bluffing!)\nEdgeworth:\nUnlike Mr. Wright, I never say anything unless I have the evidence to support it.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!?\nEdgeworth:\nYou're not thinking hard enough today, Wright. Did you think this wine glass escaped my notice?\nPhoenix:\nTh-Then...\nEdgeworth:\nOf course it has been thoroughly inspected... for fingerprints.\nPhoenix:\nFingerprints...\nEdgeworth:\nThere were only one set of fingerprints left on this wine glass.\nJudge:\nOnly one? Well, whose were they!?\nEdgeworth:\nThey were not the victim's nor the defendant's. Rather, they were of one Adrian Andrews.\nPhoenix:\nWHAT!?\nWine Glass updated in the Court Record.\nEdgeworth:\nThat is why I said that the person who had discovered the body had left it there. Are we done here, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(Grrr! I can't believe I fell into another trap!)\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Andrews was probably holding the glass when she went to see Mr. Corrida. But upon seeing his dead body, she was stunned, and set the glass down on the dresser.\nJudge:\nHmm... What you just said makes a lot of sense.\nEdgeworth:\nTsk tsk tsk... Now do you see, Wright? You can't change any part of my scenario as it explains everything all too well.\nPhoenix:\nGrrr!\nEdgeworth:\nI've thought long and hard this past year about what it means to be a \"prosecutor\". And from here on out, I will show you the answer I have come to discover!\nJudge:\nW-Wait a second... Mr. Edgeworth! I think the prosecution has provided enough evidence for me to enter my verdict...\nEdgeworth:\nUnfortunately, I can not allow you to pass judgment yet. The prosecution has yet another witness we would like the court to hear from.\nPhoenix:\n\"Another witness\"...?\nEdgeworth:\nYes. Bailiff! Please bring in the next witness!\nMia:\nWhat in the world is Mr. Edgeworth thinking?\nEdgeworth:\nNow then, witness, please state your name and occupation...\nOldbag:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n... Witness! Your name and occupation, please!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nEdgeworth:\nUurrngh!\nOldbag:\n...Heh. G.O.T.C.H.A!\nEdgeworth:\nGrrrrrrrrr...\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder what happened to that calm composure he had earlier...)\nOldbag:\nOh, Edgey-boy! It's been what, a year since we last met, hasn't it? You should be more happy to see me!\nEdgeworth:\nI saw the report with her testimony, but who knew that under that helmet... it was the wicked witch of the witness stand!?\nOldbag:\nI tell you, this time I know what I'm supposed to do! So today, I'm going to tell you anything and everything! Even things that don't have to do with that terrible crime.\nJudge:\nMs... Witness... \"That terrible crime\" is all this court needs to know.\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nJudge:\nOof!\nOldbag:\nShush! I'm talking to my dear Edgey-Wedgey right now! Don't interrupt us, gramps!\nJudge:\nYes, madam.\nEdgeworth:\nNo no no, please, by all means interrupt her! Please! *ahem* Anyway, witness, your testimony please.\nOldbag:\nIt's true what they say, that youth are hotheaded nowadays. Not that I mind at all, Edgey. Now then, what should I start with...?\nEdgeworth:\nThe witness was on security detail at the hotel on the night of the murder. Is this correct, Ms. Oldbag?\nOldbag:\nIt was a great job being able to see my dearie Juan! It was almost too much for my little heart to handle!\nJudge:\nYou mean... You were a fan of the victim?\nOldbag:\nLook, everyone is crazy over that Engarde, saying he's cute in a fresh way, or something. But not me! I wouldn't say anything so silly. After all, I have no interest in a little child like him. I'm only interested in a real man: Juan Corrida!\nPhoenix:\n(Um... But those two were the same age...)\nOldbag:\nAnyway, as I was saying, I was pacing in front of his room that night.\nEdgeworth:\nVery well. Please tell the court what you witnessed the night of the murder.\nOldbag:\nLeave it to me, Edgey-poo!\nWitness Testimony\n-- What You Witnessed --\nOldbag:\nAnyway, after the ceremony, I went to pace around in the hallway in front of his room.\nThere was something I was interested in finding out, you know...\nWell, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time.\nThat's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room.\nIt was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!\nJudge:\nHmm... So Mr. Engarde came out from the victim's room...\nOldbag:\nSee! It has to be him! He's the murderer!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nJudge:\nI see. Well, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- What You Witnessed --\nOldbag:\nAnyway, after the ceremony, I went to pace around in the hallway in front of his room.\nOldbag:\nThere was something I was interested in finding out, you know...\nOldbag:\nWell, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time.\nOldbag:\nThat's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room.\nOldbag:\nIt was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!\nOldbag:\nHe was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show.\nMia:\nShe may not remember things or be mistaken here and there, but I don't think she's lying.\nPhoenix:\nThat's bad for us. Really bad.\nMia:\nBut, that's how the human mind is. It also has the tendency to jump off-topic. She's strayed onto a few interesting side-topics this time too, hasn't she? But that's what makes her a sweet old lady, right?\nPhoenix:\n(That's because you're not the one who has to question her...)\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag...\nOldbag:\nWhat!? Don't say my name for no reason!\nPhoenix:\nDo you know what this is?\nOldbag:\nAaaah! It's button number 2 on the Jammin' Ninja's costume!\nPhoenix:\n(Now I KNOW she's an obsessed fan... She identified it in a single glance!)\nOldbag:\nGive it here! Give it here! If you don't give it to me, I'll punish you with this!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... She really is a die-hard fan to want a button covered in blood...) This button was discovered on Mr. Engarde's body during a full body search.\nOldbag:\nSee! See! This button proves beyond a shadow of a doubt it was that rascal Engarde!\nPhoenix:\nIt was caught up in the pleats of his Nickel Samurai hakama pants.\nOldbag:\nSee! See! And Engarde is the Nickel Samurai!\nPhoenix:\n...Witness! Now, it may just be me, and I do have an active imagination, but just now, didn't you say that the defendant... Matt Engarde was wearing his \"usual racing jacket\"!?\nOldbag:\n... ... ... Ah... I'm so sorry. Sorry that you judge people based on what they wear! If I wore the trendiest dress, then maybe you'd think I was the most gorgeous woman ever! But instead, I have to put up with wearing this ridiculous-looking outfit. You'd agree this outfit is hideous, right? I've got a tape recorder stuck on my chest! Lemme tell you, it's HEAVY! So heavy, I wish we would have switched to CDs ages ago! But I'm keeping that dream alive for all those kids out there, I work hard with a smile on my face, don't you understand!? Now, take a look in the mirror. Your clothes are about as interesting as a documentary on curling! You should take a tip or ten from Edgey-poo. Now HE'S got style!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nJudge:\nNow hold your tongue still there for one second! So what you saw in actuality, was not Mr. Engarde, the man... but Mr. Engarde, the Nickel Samurai!?\nOldbag:\nBut when you think about it... They're really one and the same anyway...\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag! This is a very important point we're talking about!\nOldbag:\nEdgey-poo! Do you think so too?\nEdgeworth:\nWell, it might be something worth considering. (Changed from [Well, it might be something worth thinking about.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nJust say, \"It's important\" and agree with me for a change!\nJudge:\nWitness! Think carefully and try to remember as much as you can before you testify!\nOldbag:\n*sigh* Alright, if you insist.\nPhoenix:\n(I should be the one sighing, not you!)\nWitness Testimony\n-- Who I Saw --\nOldbag:\nEngarde... Engarde... Yes, now I remember!\nThe Nickel Samurai, that's right, it was the Nickel Samurai that I saw!\nYes, it would have been convenient for him to wear his costume during the murder.\nHe had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know.\nSo he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan.\nPhoenix:\nI... I knew it... I knew you'd say he was inside that costume!\nOldbag:\nWhat? Did you think there could've been someone else inside that costume? Don't be a bad little boy, thinking such rude things.\nPhoenix:\nBut... But the possibility does exist!\nOldbag:\nAh, young'uns today. I told you, there is no way it was anyone else.\nJudge:\nH-How do you know that?\nOldbag:\nBecause... I said so. And what I say is the truth.\nPhoenix:\n(At least she's just as delightful a witness as she was a year ago...)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.\nCross Examination\n-- Who I Saw --\nOldbag:\nEngarde... Engarde... Yes, now I remember!\nOldbag:\nThe Nickel Samurai, that's right, it was the Nickel Samurai that I saw!\nOldbag:\nYes, it would have been convenient for him to wear his costume during the murder.\nOldbag:\nHe had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know.\nOldbag:\nSo he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan.\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\nMia:\nYou don't need to think too hard on this one.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMia:\nThere's a contradiction in her testimony and it's sitting in plain sight. The question is what that contradiction means for us...\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I have to figure out what you're talking about first, but OK...)\nPhoenix:\nPlease take a look at this.\nOldbag:\nYeah, so, it's a knife. Big deal. If you're trying to scare me with that, I'll have you know it won't work!\nPhoenix:\nNo no, that's not my intention at all...\nJudge:\nThat's the knife that was used in the murder, correct?\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor. Do you know why this piece of evidence is important to this case?\nJudge:\nYou don't even have to ask. It's because the defendant's fingerprints are on it.\nEdgeworth:\n... Is that what you're driving at...?\nPhoenix:\nThat is exactly what I am driving at.\nJudge:\nWhat are we driving at? And whose car are we driving?\nPhoenix:\nIf Mr. Engarde was really in the Nickel Samurai costume at the time of the murder, then it's impossible for his fingerprints to have been left on this knife! Actually, he would have wiped all previous fingerprints on this knife right off!\nJudge:\nOh, that's right! The Nickel Samurai wears gloves, doesn't he?\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nHe probably took his gloves off before he began the stabbing!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAnd why would he do something like that? To leave his prints on the murder weapon? There is no way he would do something like that!\nEdgeworth:\nHowever, there is one possibility!\nPhoenix:\nThen let's hear your \"possibility\"!\nEdgeworth:\nIt's very simple. The defendant went to the victim's room while in costume as the Nickel Samurai. At that time, the defendant held no intent to murder. He was probably just going to relax and talk with the victim about the stage show. Which is why he took his gloves off!\nJudge:\nHmm... But the murder still did take place...\nEdgeworth:\nIt's well known that there was bad blood between the defendant and the victim. (Changed from [It's well known that the defendant and the victim had bad blood between them.] in the original release)\nJudge:\nHmm, yes... I have heard that before... (Changed from [Hmm, yes... I have heard of that...] in the original release) Well, Mr. Wright? What do you have to say about Mr. Edgeworth's theory...?\nPhoenix:\n(So let me get this straight. Edgeworth's theory goes like this: When the defendant went to the victim's room, he had no intentions of killing him. Now, up to this point, are there any problems with his theory...?)\nPhoenix:\nThis theory contradicts something in an earlier testimony!\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What are you babbling about...?\nPhoenix:\nNow, for argument sake, let's suppose Mr. Engarde was the killer. If that's the case, I think it's impossible for the killer to have gone to the victim's room without intent!\nPhoenix:\nThis knife. This was used by Mr. Engarde at dinner.\nJudge:\nY-Yes, we did establish that.\nPhoenix:\nWhich means that if my client was, in fact, the killer... Then he brought this knife with him when he went to visit Mr. Corrida.\nEdgeworth:\nI suppose...\nPhoenix:\nHowever, you just said it yourself. \"At that time, the defendant held no intent to murder.\" If that were true, then why would he bring a knife!? He wouldn't, would he!?\nEdgeworth:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\nWhich means, Mr. Edgeworth, your theory was flawed from supposition one! And one more thing! If the murderer was wearing the costume at the time of the murder... Then there should be glove marks left on the knife! Which means the defendant's fingerprints shouldn't be all over it like bees on a hive!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAnd that brings me to my final point... This knife was planted by the real killer to hide their identity and mislead us!\nJudge:\nO-Order! Order, I say! Order in the court!! Was this knife really planted by the killer!? Why would the murderer do such a thing!?\nPhoenix:\nIt's to frame my client, Mr. Engarde, of course!\nJudge:\nTo frame...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nA-Aren't you forcing the interpretation just a little too hard on this one!?\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nBut we just established that the witness saw the \"Nickel Samurai\" in costume, and if that were true, then there shouldn't be a single fingerprint on this knife!\nEdgeworth:\nGrrrrrrrrr! Witneeeeeesssssss!!\nOldbag:\n... Looks like I've made your life a tiny bit more difficult, huh Edgey-poo...? (Changed from [Looks like I've made your life a tiny bit more difficult, huh Edgey...?] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\nGnnnnngh...\nJudge:\nWitness, did you or did you not really see the Nickel Samurai?\nOldbag:\nWell, I guess at first I might have forgotten, but...\nPhoenix:\nAre you saying you mixed up Mr. Engarde with the Nickel Samurai, his character on TV!?\nOldbag:\nBut I mean, I can't really do anything about that now! (Changed from [But I mean, I can't really do anything about that!] in the original release) Look, I was waiting around in front of their doors because, well... Well, I wasn't waiting around for the Nickel Samurai, that's for sure!\nPhoenix:\n...! (She wasn't waiting for the \"Nickel Samurai\"...?) Alright then... Who were you waiting around for then?\nOldbag:\n... Hmph! That's top secret to anyone outside of security!\nJudge:\nI have a feeling that you were waiting for Mr. Juan Corrida. Am I correct, witness?\nOldbag:\nHa ha ha. The way you think, you are a sad amateur with a terrible case of near-sightedness.\nJudge:\nAmateur...? Me...? What am I an amateur of...?\nPhoenix:\n(So Oldbag was waiting around in front of the victim's room... But it doesn't sound like she was waiting to catch a glimpse of Mr. Corrida...)\nMia:\nMaybe... Phoenix! Maybe the old bag was waiting around for \"that\" person!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, if it's who I think Mia's hinting at... It's certainly possible...) Ms. Oldbag. You were waiting for this person to come out of the victim's room, weren't you?\nJudge:\nWho is this person...?\nPhoenix:\nThis is Adrian Andrews, Mr. Engarde's manager.\nJudge:\nB-But why would the defendant's manager be in the victim's room...?\nEdgeworth:\nIt seems that this is the latest rumor in circulation, Your Honor.\nJudge:\n...Hmm... Oh... This is... Well, this is... Hmm, hmm... Hah, I see...\nPhoenix:\n(The judge seems to be really into the \"article\"... If it can be called such a thing...)\nJudge:\nThen this manager with the initials A. A.... Are you saying it's...?\nEdgeworth:\nAdrian Andrews. Without a doubt, the witness thought so as well.\nOldbag:\n... Hmph. Looks like you found me out. Well, that's fine. I can throw away this whole \"sworn to confidentiality stuff\" then. (Changed from [Well, that's fine. I can throw away this whole sworn to confidentiality stuff.] in the original release)\nJudge:\nW-Witness...? What in the world are you...\nMia:\nWatch out, Phoenix. I've got a bad feeling about this... A very bad feeling.\nOldbag:\nI got some information... Some very secret information from a certain source. So that's why I was doing my own little investigation... In secret, of course.\nJudge:\nB-But what for...?\nOldbag:\nOh, just for myself... Personal reasons and all that.\nJudge:\n... Well, Mr. Edgeworth. How will you proceed from here?\nEdgeworth:\nI really don't want to do this, however I cannot simply let this point slide.\nJudge:\nI see. Very well then. Witness, please testify about this \"secret information\".\nOldbag:\nGet ready! This is going to take the wind out of you young'uns!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm sure we're all capable of handling this... Really, it's not like we're ten years old.)\nWitness Testimony\n-- Secret Information --\nOldbag:\nThat Engarde is one evil, evil man!\nHe thought he could ruin poor Juan by causing a huge scandal!\nSo to do that, he sent his own manager to get in close with Juan!\nI cannot condone such dirty tricks! So I took action!\n...Oh, and this is top secret, you got that!? Nobody else but you and me know yet, OK?\nJudge:\nThe defendant sent his manager...? What a distasteful topic for this court!\nOldbag:\nWhat!? Nobody's above gossip! And isn't there a saying!? \"The truth is never pleasant.\"\nPhoenix:\n(Never heard that one before...)\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth. What about this Adrian Andrews person...?\nEdgeworth:\nWe have looked into this matter, and found that the \"truth\" the article proposes is, in fact, baseless gossip.\nJudge:\nHmm... But should this be true... Then this proves that the defendant did bear ill-will towards the victim.\nPhoenix:\n(...So this means I have to smash this rumor once and for all.)\nJudge:\nNow then, Mr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.\nMia:\nBe careful. The old bag seems rather excited right now.\nOldbag:\nThat's right! Engarde is nothing but your average foul-blooded youth!\nPhoenix:\n(Well, as the old saying goes... You've gotta burn old bags with fire! Time to fire up the afterburners and hit the highway to the danger zone!)\nCross Examination\n-- Secret Information --\nOldbag:\nThat Engarde is one evil, evil man!\nOldbag:\nHe thought he could ruin poor Juan by causing a huge scandal!\nOldbag:\nSo to do that, he sent his own manager to get in close with Juan!\nOldbag:\nI cannot condone such dirty tricks! So I took action!\nOldbag:\n...Oh, and this is top secret, you got that!? Nobody else but you and me know yet, OK?\nMia:\nSounds like just another tidbit of gossip, doesn't it? But you can't just ignore it either. It makes your client look bad either way.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I don't think I heard anything really out of the ordinary just now...)\nMia:\nThere has to be something we can catch her on...\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah... And when I find it, I'm going to press the heck out of it...)\nPhoenix:\nThe \"investigative photographer\", Lotta Hart...\nJudge:\nOh yes... I remember that mischievous girl.\nPhoenix:\nShe reported that she had lost a certain note she had written to herself.\nJudge:\nShe reported such a thing...?\nPhoenix:\nOn that piece of paper, she had written down some of her outrageo... er, impressions about the relationship between the victim and Ms. Andrews.\nOldbag:\nWh-What!? Outrageous ideas, you say!?\nPhoenix:\nNo no no, I said impressions.\nOldbag:\nThen... Then...! Then everything written on this piece of paper is completely meaningless!?\nPhoenix:\nAh! That's it! That's the note!\nOldbag:\nAh! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH! Noooo! You see, this is something completely different! This is my top secret list of groceries to buyyyyyyy!!\nJudge:\nHmm, then you are the one who took Ms. Hart's note?\nOldbag:\nI'm a huuuuuuuge fan of Juan's, that's why! That infamous, puffy-haired whippersnapper... She's working with that evil Engarde! She said so herself! \"En garde! I'm his sidekick!\" She was so happy, smiling like a silly duck. I was only checking what she had written!\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nOldbag:\n... Edgey-poo! You believe me, don't you!?\nEdgeworth:\nNngh...\nOldbag:\nI was only trying to help out like the angel I am! It's only one little piece of paper! I've never taken anything else before!\nEdgeworth:\nYou really should come with a supply of cheese to match your vintage whine.\nJudge:\nWell, it was only a piece of paper. I suppose we can overlook this just this once.\nPhoenix:\n(She looks like she's really sorry... Should I forgive her?)\nPhoenix:\nWitness! You said that the only thing you stole was that note. Is this correct?\nOldbag:\nS-S-Stole!? Why don't you listen more carefully, you annoying brat!? I saved this piece of paper from the terrible, lonely trash can! That's all!\nPhoenix:\nYou're lying, dammit! And I can prove it!!\nOldbag:\nAre you putting my credibility under scrutiny again!?\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag! I don't believe that the note is the only thing you stole that night!\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag! That note was with a camera, inside its case, wasn't it?\nJudge:\nA camera...?\nPhoenix:\nYesterday, Lotta Hart was raising a huge stink over her camera. She kept saying something like, \"My sweetie $1,600 camera disappeared on me!\"\nJudge:\nWhy... Why... Witness!!\nOldbag:\nWhat is it, gramps?\nPhoenix:\nIf you have the note, then it is only logical that you have the camera too!\nOldbag:\nGrr... Looks like you found me out again, sonny... Is this the camera you're looking for?\nPhoenix:\nAh, that's...!\nOldbag:\nWhat!? Even though I look like this, I'm still a person, you know! I still eat meals like you, I fall in love... and \"borrow\" things from people!\nJudge:\nUm... I think your definition of \"borrow\" is a little off...\nOldbag:\nI saw that woman's business card and that's when I noticed it said, \"Slimebag Celebrity Photographer Extraordinaire\"! Well, when I saw that, I had to know what sort of pictures she had taken! I'm a professional security guard! It's my business to know these things!\nJudge:\nBailiff! Check this camera's photos. Hurry! We must examine them at once!\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Edgeworth... What do we have?\nEdgeworth:\nThere is only one photo that seems to be relevant to this case.\nJudge:\nPlease present it to the court! Th-This is... This is the Nickel Samurai!\nOldbag:\nSee, I told you! That's the guy I saw!\nJudge:\nThis proves that the witness was not lying earlier about this matter.\nLotta's Photo added to the Court Record.\nJudge:\nWh-What does all this mean, Mr. Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\nThis photo by itself does not prove that the person in it is the defendant. However! In his own confession, Mr. Engarde clearly stated that... At the time of the murder, he was still in his Nickel Samurai costume!\nJudge:\nIf that is the case, then... this Nickel Samurai is...\nEdgeworth:\nThe defendant.\nJudge:\nHow did it come to this...? I think this brings us to the end. We have examined every piece of evidence thoroughly. Final comments, Mr. Wright? The court will consider them before we close. Do you agree that this photo is decisive evidence against your client?\nPhoenix:\n(If this photo really is decisive, then we're done for! But if I raise an objection here and blow it, then I would put Maya's life in jeopardy. I can't make a mistake here! There is only one road out of this mess!) This photo that Lotta took... There's...\nPhoenix:\nThere's... There's something strange with this photo!\nEdgeworth:\nI knew this was coming, Wright.\nJudge:\nYour thoughts, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nI think we can all agree there is nothing strange with this photo. There is no way for the defense to debunk this photo, even with a bunker buster.\nJudge:\n\"Debunk with a bunker buster\"!? Is that what you're planning to do, Mr. Wright!?\nPhoenix:\n... Um, anyway, please look at the photo one more time!\nJudge:\nIf you really believe you can honestly find something wrong with this photo, then you should only need one chance, correct...?\nPhoenix:\nUm... Well... (I have to find something wrong with this photo! I can't let this chance go by! Where in the heck did she take this photo from anyway...? (Changed from [Where in the heck did she take this picture anyway...?] in the original release) It's all out of focus! Why can't she take a good shot, especially when it counts!?)\nJudge:\nNow then, let's hear your objection. What about this photo is \"strange\"...?\nPhoenix:\nI would like to direct the court's attention to this one area right here!\nJudge:\nWh-What are you pointing to? His ankles...?\nPhoenix:\nIf you could see this person's ankle, that would be one thing... However you can't.\nJudge:\nA-And...? What does that mean...?\nPhoenix:\nThe costumed person in this photo could not have been Mr. Engarde! (Changed from [The 'Nickel Samurai' in this photo could not have been Mr. Engarde!] in the original release)\nJudge:\nWhat is the meaning of this!?\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nI wonder if you would care to elaborate... With actual facts, that is.\nPhoenix:\nLet's take a look at the Nickel Samurai's poster. Please pay particular attention to the area around the bottom of the hakama.\nJudge:\nHis... His socks... You can see his socks...\nPhoenix:\nExactly! However, in this photo... The Nickel Samurai is clearly holding his hakama up just to walk!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nThere is only one explanation for this! The person inside this costume is clearly much shorter than the defendant! (Alright. I think I've turned things around for myself this time!)\nMia:\nThat's curious...\nPhoenix:\nHuh? What is?\nMia:\nEdgeworth is unusually calm today...\nPhoenix:\nThat's true...\nMia:\nHe's just letting the trial run itself -- as if he's only along for the ride.\nPhoenix:\n\"Along for the ride\"...? What do you mean by that?\nMia:\nI can only think that perhaps he doesn't feel under attack at all...\nPhoenix:\n(He doesn't feel under attack!? Then, I haven't damaged his case at all!?) (Changed from [He doesn't feel under attack!? Then, he's not taking any damage!?] in the original release)\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth! Where does this leave us!?\nEdgeworth:\n...\nJudge:\nIf the person in this photo is not Matt Engarde... Then everything the prosecution has tried to prove has become meaningless!\nEdgeworth:\n... Hmm... I thought it would come to this.\nPhoenix:\nWHAT!?\nEdgeworth:\nWright. I have something I want to ask you. I think you have proven that the person inside this costume is not Matt Engarde. In that case... Who IS this a photo of...?\nPhoenix:\n(Who is the person wearing the Nickel Samurai costume?)\nMia:\nDon't stress out over this, Phoenix. It's very simple. What you should be focused on is Edgeworth's attitude, don't you think?\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah... Why is he so calm...?)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. Let's hear your thoughts. Who is the person in this photograph...?\nJudge:\nA-Adrian Andrews...?\nPhoenix:\nIf you want to know who that Nickel Samurai is, it is none other than this woman!\nEdgeworth:\nAnd why would you say it must be Ms. Andrews!? What in the world points you to her? (Changed from [And why would you say it would be Ms. Andrews!? What in the world points you to her?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nFor starters, she's short. And, she can freely move in and out of Mr. Engarde's room. Finally, she had dinner with Mr. Engarde that night.\nJudge:\nAnd how does that all add up?\nPhoenix:\nIt means that it makes it very easy for her to get a certain item. ...A certain knife with Mr. Engarde's fingerprints all over it!\nJudge:\nThe knife that was used as a murder weapon!\nEdgeworth:\nWhy don't you just say what it is you want, Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(I have to do this now! This is my last chance to turn things around!) The defense motions to indict Ms. Adrian Andrews in the murder of Juan Corrida! It was Ms. Andrews who tried to frame the defendant for the crime!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order!! ORDER!! It looks like this trial has hit a most unexpected development! Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nYes, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nThis court is issuing a subpoena for Ms. Adrian Andrews! A verdict cannot be passed without first hearing her testimony!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Alright! This is it...)\nMia:\nThis... is kind of bad for us.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? What do you mean?\nMia:\nIf Adrian Andrews is summoned to court as a witness... It means that the trial will go on for another day.\nPhoenix:\nOne more day...? Ack!! (If I don't get a verdict TODAY, then Maya...!)\nJudge:\nNow then, we shall set Ms. Andrews' testimony for tomorrow...\nPhoenix:\n(Wh-What am I supposed to do!? The judge is about to adjourn the court!)\nEdgeworth:\nI abhor wasting such valuable time...\nPhoenix:\nE-Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor. I request that you please continue with today's trial.\nJudge:\nB-But... We cannot continue due to this unexpected development!\nEdgeworth:\nTsk, tsk. \"Unexpected\" development? I think you underestimate me, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nAnd what do you mean by that...?\nEdgeworth:\nThat Mr. Phoenix Wright would slave his way to subpoenaing Ms. Adrian Andrews is all happening according to plan... Even if Wright was a bit slow to catch on...\nPhoenix:\nWh-Wh-Wh... WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT!?\nJudge:\nWhat is the meaning of your statement, Mr. Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Adrian Andrews is currently waiting in the prosecution lobby... She is the next witness.\nPhoenix:\n...! (Everything... Everything was planned out in advance by that man...?)\nMia:\nSomehow, I knew there was no way Edgeworth would overlook Ms. Andrews... Looks like this battle is far from over.\nEdgeworth:\nExactly.\nJudge:\nVery well. We will call the next witness. However... Before we proceed, we shall take a 10 minute recess. Please prepare your witness in that time, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nJudge:\nThe court will now take a 10 minute recess.\nTo be continued.\nMarch 22, 2:14 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3\nEngarde:\nDude! I can't believe that Adrian... No way! Not cool and collected Adrian Andrews!\nPhoenix:\nShe is your manager. It would have been very easy for her to pull this off. The only person who had easy access to the knife you used at dinner was, well... her.\nEngarde:\nSo after the ceremony, during the break, huh...? I was sleeping like a log the entire time...\nPhoenix:\nSee, she could have also easily planted that blood-covered button in your hakama.\nEngarde:\nHmm... Because she was the one that came to wake me up? ... Then... Dude, you're saying it really was her...?\nPhoenix:\nYes. She is the real killer... She was the one who murdered Juan Corrida.\nEngarde:\nBut... Why!? I thought she was buds with Juan...!\nPhoenix:\nShe has her own agenda.\nEngarde:\nH-Her own agenda!? Wh-What are you talking about?\nPhoenix:\nI'm sure you'll see by the time this trial's over. It'll be alright. I'll get you acquitted by the end of today.\nEngarde:\nGet me a verdict that's refreshing like a spring breeze, OK Mr. Lawyer dude?\nMia:\nPhoenix... You think her motive is related to Celeste Inpax's missing suicide note, right?\nPhoenix:\n...Yes. Ms. Andrews depended on Ms. Inpax for her strength and reason to live. (Changed from [Ms. Andrews depended on Ms. Inpax for her strength and will to live.] in the original release) But then Ms. Inpax suddenly killed herself. It sounds like she left a suicide note, and the person thought to have hidden it...\nMia:\n...Is Juan Corrida, the victim of this murder.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's why I think that Ms. Andrews got close to Mr. Corrida... All to get the suicide note back!\nMia:\nThat sounds plausible... But one thing bothers me.\nPhoenix:\nUm, what...?\nMia:\nWho was it that first told us about their relationship? Better stated, Mr. Andrews' dependency issues with regards to Ms. Inpax...? (Changed from [Better stated, Mr. Andrews' co-dependency with regards to Ms. Inpax...?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n... It was Edgeworth...\nMia:\nIt looks like he's still the one in command of this ship. Don't let your guard down yet.\nMarch 22, 2:25 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3\nJudge:\nCourt will now reconvene. Now then, Mr. Edgeworth, if you please.\nEdgeworth:\nThe prosecution calls the witness subpoenaed by this court. Ms. Adrian Andrews, the person who discovered the crime in Mr. Juan Corrida's room!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is your occupation?\nAndrews:\nI am the manager of the defendant in this case, Mr. Matt Engarde.\nJudge:\nI see. Now then...\nAndrews:\nBefore we begin, Your Honor, I have one request.\nJudge:\nUh, yes, sure. What is it?\nAndrews:\nI'm sure everyone in this room is wondering the same thing, and would love to find out more about my relationship with the victim. After all, it was the topic of a certain weekly \"magazine\" recently...\nJudge:\nAh, no, I have no idea what you mean. I've never even heard of \"Gossip Land\"...\nPhoenix:\n(If the judge was ever a prosecution witness, he'd do all my work for me...)\nEdgeworth:\nAnyway, I was wondering if you could please tell us about your relation to the victim.\nAndrews:\nYes, I was seeing Mr. Corrida. I was also aware of the rivalry that existed between Matt and Juan... But this was a private matter between Juan and myself.\nJudge:\nHmm, so it was a \"fry 'n bait\" matter... or was that \"bait 'n fry\"? Reminds me of fishing...\nAndrews:\nBut I... But I didn't kill him.\nEdgeworth:\nNo one has accused you of that.\nAndrews:\nI think there's someone who would beg to differ. (Changed from [I've got a feeling someone will soon...] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n...!\nJudge:\nI think we all understand your relationship with the victim now, Ms. Andrews.\nEdgeworth:\nVery well then. Witness, please testify to the court about what happened when you discovered the murder that had taken place.\nWitness Testimony\n-- When I Found the Body --\nAndrews:\nIt was time for the show to start, so I went to get Matt from his room.\nAfter that, I went to Juan's room.\nAnd there was his dead body. I... I was in shock...\nWhat I saw was, naturally, the exact same scene as in the crime scene photo.\nI felt as though I was about to faint, so I poured myself a glass of juice.\nJudge:\nYou poured yourself a glass of juice...?\nAndrews:\nYes. Sadly, I didn't remember not to touch things at the scene of a crime... And I disturbed the crime scene by moving this one thing...\nEdgeworth:\nAnd that is when the fingerprints on the wine glass were made, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nI see. Well, Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.\nMia:\nPhoenix. She is one cool and collected customer, and she has the brains to match.\nPhoenix:\nYes... I know.\nMia:\nIn order to catch a person like her, you have to avoid head-on confrontations. You should disrupt her pacing. (Changed from [You should disrupt her pace.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nDisrupt her pacing...? (Changed from [Disrupt her pace...?] in the original release)\nMia:\nShe's the type of woman who is easily thrown off by things inconsistent with her thinking so you have to attack when she least expects it. The instant you let up on your offense is the instant this trial is over. Understand?\nCross Examination\n-- When I Found the Body --\nAndrews:\nIt was time for the show to start, so I went to get Matt from his room.\nAndrews:\nAfter that, I went to Juan's room.\nAndrews:\nAnd there was his dead body. I... I was in shock...\nAndrews:\nWhat I saw was, naturally, the exact same scene as in the crime scene photo.\nAndrews:\nI felt as though I was about to faint, so I poured myself a glass of juice.\nAndrews:\nI was the one who knocked the flower vase over, where it fell onto the guitar case.\nPhoenix:\n(It doesn't sound like there's any glaring contradictions in her testimony just now...)\nMia:\nI warned you earlier that she would not crack so easily. The only way to make her is to...\nPhoenix:\n...Keep on the offensive and not let up.\nMia:\nThe only way you're going to catch her is with some very strong, decisive evidence...\nPhoenix:\n(I have to find something! I just have to! ...For Maya's sake...)\nPhoenix:\nYou testified that you knocked the flower vase over. Is this correct?\nAndrews:\nYes.\nPhoenix:\nAnd are you sure it fell onto the guitar case?\nAndrews:\nI-Is there some problem with what I said...?\nPhoenix:\nIt's not \"some\" problem, it's a \"major\" problem. It's true that the top of the guitar case was wet with water. However, that's exactly what is so strange! Ms. Andrews! You testified that the vase fell onto the guitar case! However! If that was true, the case should have gotten wet on the inside, not the outside!\nJudge:\nTh-That's very true!\nPhoenix:\nFurthermore, there is one other strange thing about this guitar case.\nJudge:\nAnd wh-what is that?\nPhoenix:\nLet's take another look at the crime scene photo. The remains of the vase are scattered on the floor.\nJudge:\nAnd what is wrong with that?\nPhoenix:\nIf the guitar case was open when the vase fell... The glass shards should be INSIDE, not outside the case!\nAndrews:\nAh!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is your point, Wright!? That the case was closed at the time the vase was knocked over? Is that all!?\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nNo. Think back to what Ms. Andrews testified to! She said that other than the vase, she didn't touch anything else!\nEdgeworth:\nNngh...\nJudge:\nYes, that's right... She did implicitly say she didn't touch the guitar case!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nBut... But this whole matter with the guitar case is a dead end! The bright red guitar was found at the studio! It has no bearing on this case at all!\nPhoenix:\n... That may very well be, however... (Argh, the empty guitar case does seem to have no relation to this case, doesn't it...) (Changed from [An empty guitar case does seem to have no relation to this case...] in the original release)\nJudge:\nHmm... It seems that there is no deeper meaning to the guitar case. Well, Mr. Wright? Do you think we need to hear more details about the guitar case?\nPhoenix:\nThe empty guitar case... I believe this is a crucial piece of the puzzle!\nEdgeworth:\nHeh! I can't believe ANYONE would reach for straws like this! But it is you...\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe I'm doing this either...)\nJudge:\nAlright. I'll follow along... For now. Ms. Andrews, please testify to the court about the guitar case.\nAndrews:\nYes, Your Honor.\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Guitar Case --\nAndrews:\nI don't remember too clearly because I was a bit dazed.\nI suppose I must have opened the guitar case... after I knocked the vase over.\nIt's not a big deal though, right? The case was empty after all.\nAs for why I opened the case... Even I don't know.\nJudge:\nHmm... It looks like this really wasn't a very important point.\nEdgeworth:\nThis wastefulness is such a familiar feeling by now that it's almost... comforting.\nPhoenix:\nUm, anyway, I'll just go ahead and start the cross-examination...\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. Using \"anyway\" to change the topic -- a convenient escape for a weak man.\nCross Examination\n-- The Guitar Case --\nAndrews:\nI don't remember too clearly because I was a bit dazed.\nAndrews:\nI suppose I must have opened the guitar case... after I knocked the vase over.\nAndrews:\nIt's not a big deal though, right? The case was empty after all.\nAndrews:\nAs for why I opened the case... Even I don't know.\nMia:\nCome on, Phoenix. We can't afford to let up on her now.\nPhoenix:\nI wasn't planning on letting up, but...\nMia:\nShe's at her weakest now, so this is our chance!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, if we had a weapon to hit her with...)\nMia:\nI'm sure a weapon is hiding somewhere in the Court Record, waiting to be found.\nPhoenix:\nI have your proof right here. This wine glass.\nAndrews:\nThe wine glass?\nPhoenix:\nYou left your fingerprints very clearly on this wine glass.\nAndrews:\nAh...\nPhoenix:\nEven if you took your gloves off when you poured yourself this glass of juice, wouldn't you think it was just a little strange... That you put your gloves back on, just to open the guitar case!?\nAndrews:\nUgn!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order!!\nMia:\nLooks like you hit the nail on the head this time.\nPhoenix:\n...? What do you mean?\nMia:\nI believe that guitar case plays a very important role here.\nPhoenix:\nBut it's just an empty case...\nMia:\nI wonder if it really was empty though...\nPhoenix:\nB-But the guitar... The bright red guitar was at the studio!\nMia:\nPhoenix, drop all of your presumptions. What was in the guitar case was not the bright red guitar.\nPhoenix:\n(You don't mean... it was a bright WHITE guitar!? Wait, that's not right either...)\nJudge:\nHmm, I admit it would be unnatural for someone to do that. So the witness was not wearing gloves, despite the fact that on the case...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor, this is obviously the defense's usual misdirection tactic at work. Steer the court towards an unrelated topic, and lull us all into his misguided...\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nNo, Your Honor! Please recall that Ms. Andrews had testified that the vase \"fell onto the guitar case\"! Which means that the case was closed when the crime took place! However, it is wide open in this photo of the crime scene! I am sure this guitar case has some relation to the murder!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nIf you are so sure, Wright, then I'm sure you can somehow substantiate your outrageous claim, correct!? Please, enlighten us as to why that guitar case has anything at all to do with this murder!\nPhoenix:\nUh...\nJudge:\nCan you do that, Mr. Wright!?\nPhoenix:\nUm, well... Let's suppose for a second... That the bright red guitar was not the only thing that could have been in the case...\nJudge:\nThe bright red guitar not being the only thing...? Y-You don't mean to suggest that a bright BLACK guitar was inside the--\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nSo, you intend to push your theory that the case was not empty!? Is that it, Wright!?\nPhoenix:\nI wouldn't say something I didn't intend to prove!\nEdgeworth:\nDeflate that head of yours! You haven't proven anything yet! Now then, let's have it. What was inside this case at the time of the murder!?\nJudge:\nTh-This is... This is a photograph...!\nPhoenix:\nYes, but what is important is what is in that picture, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nI-In this picture...?\nPhoenix:\nIt doesn't take a genius to see what I mean! What I am proposing is... Inside the guitar case was the Nickel Samurai! The hero's very own costume!\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What!?\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Wright! Explain yourself!\nEdgeworth:\nWright! Are you saying that the witness opened the guitar case to take out a costume!? What insane point would there be to doing something like that!?\nPhoenix:\nThat insane point would be to wear the costume, of course. Ms. Andrews put it on to hide her identity so she could make her escape. After all, you couldn't let anyone see you leave, could you, Ms. Andrews?\nAndrews:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nI-I refuse to accept your theory! Do you have anything to support such a preposterous idea!?\nPhoenix:\nJust outside the door was an investigative photographer who was starving for a big scoop. And in the end, she managed to get this shot, correct?\nJudge:\nYou... You mean this photo!? Order! Ordeeeer! It looks like we've wandered into quite another mess again, haven't we...?\nMia:\nNice job, Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\nWell, you know my strategy. Speak first, think later!\nJudge:\nHmm... So the real murderer was hiding inside a costume...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nW-Wait one second, Your Honor! The Nickel Samurai's costume would have been Mr. Matt Engarde's! Why would something of the defendant's be in the victim's room!? And inside the guitar case, of all places!?\nJudge:\nHmm, true... That is a little baffling... Mr. Wright, the court would like to hear your thoughts. What was this Nickel Samurai costume doing inside the guitar case...?\nPhoenix:\nMr. Engarde did not take his costume off during the break period... In that case, the costume we are talking about was a spare one.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat...?\nJudge:\nThen... are you saying that on the night of the murder... there were TWO Nickel Samurai costumes at the Gatewater Hotel!?\nPhoenix:\nYes, that is what I am saying.\nJudge:\nAnd how do you explain the costume that was inside the guitar case...?\nEdgeworth:\nIt would mean that the victim himself had brought this spare to the ceremony on purpose! (Changed from [It would mean that the victim himself had planned to bring this spare to the ceremony!] in the original release)\nJudge:\nBut... But why!? The victim, Mr. Corrida, was the Jammin' Ninja. Why would he secretly bring the Nickel Samurai's spare costume with him...? What could be the reason behind such a peculiar act?\nPhoenix:\n... And therein lies the sticking point... (Changed from [... Ah, so that's what he intended...] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What are you mumbling to yourself about now!? Have you just been rambling all this time without any sense of inner monologue!?\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? N-No, I just...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, please explain yourself! Why do you think the victim had the Nickel Samurai's spare costume!?\nMia:\nPhoenix... Are you sure you can explain this one? Think carefully before you answer... And then answer with gusto! I believe in you!\nPhoenix:\nAlright. This is what I think. The reason the victim brought the Nickel Samurai's spare costume to the hotel was...\nJudge:\nWhat is this...?\nPhoenix:\nOn the night of the murder, after the stage show, the Nickel Samurai was going to hold a special press conference.\nJudge:\nA press conference...?\nPhoenix:\nYes, the Nickel Samurai was supposed to confess something at this conference.\nEdgeworth:\nI heard about this as well. For once, you're not making something up, Wright.\nPhoenix:\nBut what struck me as strange was that Mr. Engarde himself said he had no idea he was supposed to be holding a press conference that night.\nAndrews:\n...\nJudge:\nBut how can that be!?\nPhoenix:\nThe way I see it, that can mean only one thing: The conference was set up by none other than the victim, Mr. Juan Corrida himself!\nJudge:\nTh-The victim?\nPhoenix:\nYes. The spare Nickel Samurai costume was prepared for that very conference! Mr. Corrida was going to hold the press conference as the \"Nickel Samurai\"!\nJudge:\nHe was going to dress up as the Nickel Samurai and hold a conference!? But why would the victim do such a thing!?\nPhoenix:\nThat's something I don't quite know yet, however... What I am concerned with right now is what he intended to reveal at that conference.\nEdgeworth:\nThe Nickel Samurai was going to \"confess\" something. And by \"confess\", I'd wager he was going to reveal something about \"himself\".\nPhoenix:\nWhich means that Juan Corrida, posing as the Nickel Samurai, was going to speak about Matt Engarde!\nJudge:\nYes, I guess that is what it would mean...\nEdgeworth:\nBut, if that's the case... that's not a \"confession\"! That's \"public disclosure\"!\nAndrews:\nHmph.\nJudge:\nM-Ms. Andrews...?\nAndrews:\nI can see why you are pros at what you do.\nJudge:\nPardon me?\nAndrews:\nYes, just as you say, the press conference was set up by Juan.\nJudge:\nMs. Andrews! Please offer us an explanation for this!\nAndrews:\nI was the one he asked to help set it up. And the person who prepared the second costume for him... That was also me.\nJudge:\nYou...!?\nAndrews:\nJuan had bet everything on the Jammin' Ninja this year. And if he lost the Grand Prix... He was going to make sure Matt was going down with him. That's what he thought anyway.\nJudge:\nHe was going to ruin him, huh...?\nAndrews:\nIt looked like somehow, Juan had in his hands a secret so powerful... that it would destroy Matt's acting career had it been revealed!\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nJudge:\nAnd do you know what this \"secret\" of Mr. Engarde's is, Ms. Andrews...?\nAndrews:\n... That's something only Juan knew. I... I don't know what it is.\nJudge:\nAh... I see.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nAndrews:\nI... I've probably been coming off quite suspicious to everyone, but that's to be expected. I've been trying to protect Matt, after all...\nPhoenix:\nP-Protect Mr. Engarde!?\nJudge:\nAnd yet again another strange bit of truth comes to light it seems... Ms. Andrews, if you could, please tell us the truth about your behavior!\nAndrews:\nYes, Your Honor. I understand.\nWitness Testimony\n-- Protecting Matt --\nAndrews:\nFrom the moment I saw the crime scene, I had a feeling that Matt was the murderer.\nMatt had to kill Juan no matter what.\nAnd he didn't have an alibi for what he was doing at the time of the murder.\nMy thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife...\nBut I'm Matt's manager... So I felt that I had to protect him...\nJudge:\nHmm... This does account for everything...\nAndrews:\nWell... I am the logical type.\nMia:\nWe're finally seeing her true self. She is more nervous than a scared rabbit.\nJudge:\nIf the defense can find no fault with this testimony, I am ready to make a ruling. (Changed from [If there are no objections, I feel that I can pass a verdict based on this testimony.] in the original release) Please keep that in mind as you cross-examine, Mr. Wright. (Changed from [Now then, Mr. Wright, if you please.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like somehow everything has swung to the opposite end of the scale again... That just means I have to put my weight into this and turn her logic upside-down!)\nCross Examination\n-- Protecting Matt --\nAndrews:\nFrom the moment I saw the crime scene, I had a feeling that Matt was the murderer.\nAndrews:\nMatt had to kill Juan no matter what.\nAndrews:\nI know what his motive was. ...But I don't have any way to prove I'm right.\nAndrews:\nAnd he didn't have an alibi for what he was doing at the time of the murder.\nAndrews:\nMy thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife...\nAndrews:\nThat button was torn off of Juan during his fight with Matt.\nAndrews:\nBut I'm Matt's manager... So I felt that I had to protect him...\nPhoenix:\nAs I expected, Ms. Andrews' testimony seems pretty solid.\nMia:\nReally? Because to me, it sounded a little wishy-washy.\nPhoenix:\nWishy-washy? (Well, I guess we'll see if I press a little more...)\nMia:\nYou should know this by now, but you'll need strong, decisive evidence to make her talk.\nPhoenix:\nGot it, Chief! (...I'm going to pin you down this time, Ms. Andrews!)\nPhoenix:\nThis is the victim's autopsy report. It clearly states that the cause of death was \"strangulation by a scarf\".\nAndrews:\nS...Strangulation...\nPhoenix:\nThe knife stab to the victim was done after the victim had already died.\nJudge:\nA-And what does that mean?\nPhoenix:\nLet's examine the evidence. This button has the victim's blood on it. Which would mean that it was ripped off of the costume... when?\nEdgeworth:\nAfter the knife was stabbed into the victim...\nPhoenix:\nExactly! Which means... It is impossible that this button was torn off during the victim's final struggle, because the victim was strangled to death in that fight!\nAndrews:\nAh...\nPhoenix:\nThat's right, Ms. Andrews. There is no way this button was ripped off during the struggle. This button was consciously pulled off of the victim's already dead body!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Wh-What is the meaning--\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is the meaning of this, Wright!? So what if the button was torn off the body after the victim had already died? What does that change!?\nPhoenix:\nLet me ask you one simple question, Mr. Edgeworth. Why was the button torn off? What purpose did that serve?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat \"purpose\"...?\nPhoenix:\nWe now know this button was not torn off during the fight. So the murderer took the time and effort to purposely rip this from the victim's body. That would mean that the murderer had something in mind, wouldn't it?\nEdgeworth:\n...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Does this mean... Does this mean you know what the murderer wanted to do with this button!? What was it!?\nPhoenix:\nThere is only one logical reason for doing something like that. It was to pin the crime on Mr. Engarde!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nThere is no way anyone would put a bloodied button in their own pants! That's right! Mr. Engarde was set up! By the real killer, of course!\nJudge:\nAnd... The real murder is...? Well, Mr. Wright!? Who in the world is the real killer then!?\nPhoenix:\n(Finally... I can't believe I managed to bring this trial all the way up to this point...)\nMia:\nPhoenix... You can't let your guard down yet! Not until the very end!\nPhoenix:\nThe real killer, the person who planned to frame Mr. Engarde is...\nPhoenix:\nMs. Adrian Andrews! I choose you! You are Mr. Corrida's killer!\nAndrews:\nWh-What!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order!! Mr. Wright! This is a very grave matter! Do you have any evidence that supports your charge...?\nPhoenix:\n\"Any evidence\"...? ALL of the evidence points to Ms. Andrews!\nAndrews:\nWh... How preposterous! You can't stick any of that on me!\nPhoenix:\nI can't, can I? Would you care to test me?\nAndrews:\nThen... Then what about this knife!?\nPhoenix:\nThe knife was used to stab the victim after he had already been strangled to death. It was used to throw suspicion onto Mr. Engarde, naturally. A knife covered in the defendant's fingerprints could only be taken from his room. And the only one who had dinner with him, and knew which knife to take, was you.\nAndrews:\n...Tsk! Th-Then! What... What about the button that was found in Matt's hakama!?\nPhoenix:\nThis button was removed from the victim's body after he had already died. The only people who could've done so were the person who found his body or the killer. However, if Mr. Engarde was the real killer, there is no way he would have put such incriminating evidence in his own hakama!\nAndrews:\nUghn...\nPhoenix:\nThe only person who could have put this button into Mr. Engarde's hakama, is the person who went to wake him from his nap... which is you, yet again, Ms. Andrews.\nJudge:\nI... I see... What about the empty guitar case...?\nPhoenix:\nThat is also another piece of evidence that incriminates Ms. Andrews. That costume was used to hide the real killer's identity as they fled the crime scene. Now, who could have known that there was just such a costume inside the guitar case...? It could only have been the person who prepared the costume for the victim. And that person is... you, Ms. Adrian Andrews!\nAndrews:\nN...No... I...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nBut Ms. Andrews' fingerprints were nowhere to be found on the guitar case! And it was you who proved that she was not wearing gloves at the time!\nJudge:\n...! Th-That's right!\nPhoenix:\nThat's because she did not intend on leaving any prints. If anyone had found out that she had touched the case, they would have asked her why. So to avoid leaving any prints, she used a towel or something else to open it. But! The glass of tomato juice is a different story! Ms. Andrews purposefully left her fingerprints on the glass to show that yes, indeed, she was the classic \"dazed discoverer\" of a dead body!\nAndrews:\nAaaaaah!\nPhoenix:\nAnd to top it all off, there is this photo! A photo of the killer as they exited the scene of the crime. No reasonable person on Earth can believe this Nickel Samurai is Mr. Engarde! He would be much too short for his own costume if it was him.\nAndrews:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nSpeaking of how tall people are... Ms. Andrews, you're also kind of short in stature, are you not?\nAndrews:\nP-Please... Stop...\nPhoenix:\nWell, how about it, Ms. Andrews!?\nAndrews:\nUm...\nPhoenix:\n(I've got her this time!)\nAndrews:\n...\nJudge:\nMs. Andrews...?\nAndrews:\n... I... I... I refuse... to testify.\nPhoenix:\nWhat was that...?\nAndrews:\nTh-There's a law... It says I can't be forced to testify about something... if it can incriminate me!\nJudge:\nWell, yes... You are absolutely correct, Ms. Andrews. The law does provide us with a way to avoid self-incrimination... by allowing a witness to not testify if the testimony can cause damage to themselves.\nPhoenix:\nWHAT!? (\"Pleading the fifth\" is not something most people would think to do on the spot! Actually... Thinking back to yesterday in Mr. Engarde's room...)\nvon Karma:\nAdrian Andrews!\nAndrews:\nY-Yes...?\nvon Karma:\nThink hard about what we just discussed. Understood!?\nAndrews:\nA-Alright... ...\nPhoenix:\n(That's it. That's when Franziska planted this idea into her head... She must have told Ms. Andrews to not testify if things looked bad.)\nMia:\nYou did a good job proving everything up to this point, Phoenix. But there is still one thing you haven't done.\nPhoenix:\nSomething I haven't done...?\nEdgeworth:\nHeh heh heh. What's wrong, Wright? Are you finished already? Run out of evidence?\nPhoenix:\n...!\nJudge:\nWhat is so humorous, Mr. Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\nI'm sure you realize this as well, Your Honor... But, everything the good lawyer here has proven up to this point is meaningless.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!?\nEdgeworth:\nEverything you have proven is circumstantial.\nPhoenix:\nCircumstantial...?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, circumstantial. You have yet to provide a single piece of definitive proof. Proof that Ms. Andrews, did in fact, harbor a wish to murder Mr. Corrida!\nJudge:\nM-Ms. Andrews! You... Did you want to kill Mr. Corrida...?\nAndrews:\nI believe this may lead to me incriminating myself, so I will abstain from answering.\nJudge:\nBut Ms. Andrews... If you do that, it would be the same as admitting your guilt, don't you think...?\nAndrews:\nMaybe so, or maybe not. There is nothing to prove it either way. Besides, you don't even know what crime I would be \"guilty\" of due to my silence.\nPhoenix:\n(NO!! She's taking that defiant attitude again!) M-Mia! What should we do...?\nMia:\nSomehow, we've landed in the worst possible situation.\nJudge:\nI think we have reached a certain conclusion at this point in time. Ms. Adrian Andrews has refused to testify. And the defense's theory that she is the actual murderer... has not been fully substantiated with solid, definitive proof.\nPhoenix:\nBut! That's not true!\nJudge:\nIn this situation, there is only one thing this court can do. And that is to declare a recess.\nPhoenix:\nR-Recess...!?\nJudge:\nI request that both the prosecution and the defense look further into this matter. And at tomorrow's trial...\nPhoenix:\n(T-Tomorrow...!? We don't have a \"tomorrow\"! If we don't get a not guilty verdict today, then...)\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nPlease wait, Your Honor! Th...That's not necessary! The trial... Please continue the trial!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat are you sweating for...? Your client is getting one more day to live, isn't he?\nPhoenix:\nThat... That's not it! This isn't about that. Edgeworth! I know you know who the real killer is! Please... Let the trial continue! If I don't get the verdict... then Maya...\nEdgeworth:\n...?\nJudge:\nBut it's impossible to continue as long as the witness refuses to testify. Now then, this court is...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nIt is not impossible for this trial to continue.\nAndrews:\n...!\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth! Wh-What are you...\nEdgeworth:\nIt's true Ms. Andrews holds the right against self-incrimination; however, if the topic of conversation were something unrelated to whatever she may be guilty of, then she has no right to withhold testimony!\nJudge:\nY-Yes, that is very true, but...\nEdgeworth:\nActually, there is one little thing that I'm curious about. Ms. Andrews.\nAndrews:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nWhen you found the victim's dead body, you poured yourself a glass of juice.\nAndrews:\nY-Yes... And...?\nEdgeworth:\nI can't help but think how unnatural that is. Usually when one finds a body, they are shaken up, not stirring a glass of juice.\nAndrews:\nSo my actions were \"unusual\"? But I've already...\nEdgeworth:\nBefore you speak, I want to state that if you have a reason behind your actions, I would like you to testify to that effect.\nAndrews:\nTestify...!?\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor! I would like to request that the witness testify again as to what happened when she first discovered the victim's body! Whatever we find out in this testimony should in no way implicate the witness.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nMia:\nI don't know what it is about Edgeworth today, but I can't get a good read off of him. Is he friend or foe? I just don't know...\nJudge:\nThe court acknowledges the prosecution's request. Ms. Andrews, if you please.\nWitness Testimony\n-- When I Found the Body --\nAndrews:\nThat glass of juice... I didn't really pour it for myself.\nI was surprised when I walked into the room and saw it in that messy state.\nAnd Juan... He was sitting slumped over and tired-looking in the corner.\nWhen I saw him sitting like that, the thought that he was dead didn't cross my mind.\nTo be honest, I thought he had just fainted or something. So I went to pour him some juice.\nWhen I realized that he was dead... That's when I knocked the flower vase over.\nJudge:\nHmm... So you poured that glass of juice for the victim. Why didn't you say so in your earlier testimony?\nAndrews:\n...I didn't think I needed to include something so trivial.\nMia:\nPhoenix. Please be careful here. If you can't find anything wrong with this testimony, then there's nothing left...\nPhoenix:\nI know. (Edgeworth... What the heck is going on in that brain of yours...?)\nJudge:\nNow then, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- When I Found the Body --\nAndrews:\nThat glass of juice... I didn't really pour it for myself.\nAndrews:\nI was surprised when I walked into the room and saw it in that messy state.\nAndrews:\nAnd Juan... He was sitting slumped over and tired-looking in the corner.\nAndrews:\nWhen I saw him sitting like that, the thought that he was dead didn't cross my mind.\nAndrews:\nTo be honest, I thought he had just fainted or something. So I went to pour him some juice.\nAndrews:\nWhen I realized that he was dead... That's when I knocked the flower vase over.\nMia:\n... This is what it all comes down to.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMia:\nThis is the absolute end for both sides... And Adrian is letting her guard down. Phoenix, now is our best chance yet to kill the prosecution's case!\nPhoenix:\n(Isn't that a bit harsh...? Ms. Andrews... Will you tell us the truth this time...?)\nPhoenix:\nSo you honestly didn't think he was dead when you found him?\nAndrews:\nNo, not at all...\nPhoenix:\nEven though this is what you saw when you discovered the body?\nAndrews:\n...Ah!\nJudge:\nWh-What is the meaning of this!?\nPhoenix:\nIsn't it obvious, Your Honor? There is a knife sticking straight out of Mr. Corrida's chest! Anyone who saw this scene would have immediately thought that here was a dead man!\nAndrews:\nAh... Um... That's... Well, you see...\nPhoenix:\nI doubt a single person in the world would mistake this for someone who fainted, and then so nonchalantly go pour something to drink!\nJudge:\nY-Your point is...?\nPhoenix:\nMs. Andrews! Your testimony just now... It was all one giant lie!\nAndrews:\nUngh!\nPhoenix:\nAnd your lie has proven one thing very clearly. That you are the real killer!\nAndrews:\n... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!\nJudge:\nIt looks like the defense has somehow brought the ugly truth to light. The defendant, Mr. Matt Engarde, is not guilty after all...\nAndrews:\nThat... But that's impossible! You're wrong...\nJudge:\nM-Ms. Andrews! Try to have some composure!\nAndrews:\nIt... It wasn't me... It wasn't me, I tell you! It was Matt! I swear it! He's the one who killed Juan!\nPhoenix:\nBut you were the one who refused to testify! And your reason for not doing so was that you \"might\" end up incriminating yourself!\nAndrews:\nTh-That's because...\nJudge:\nMs. Andrews, I will give you one last chance. What exactly are you hiding that may \"incriminate\" you?\nAndrews:\n... I... I... I refuse... to testify.\nJudge:\nThen there is no need for this court to continue any further. Mr. Matt Engarde's innocence has been clearly demonstrated.\nPhoenix:\n(Is... Is it... over...? Have we... Have we found the truth at last...?)\nMia:\nWhat's wrong, Phoenix?\nPhoenix:\nUsually... Well, usually, the real killer confesses his or her guilt. And now that I think about it, this is the first time someone hasn't.\nJudge:\nNow then, I would like to hand down my verdict for Mr. Matt Engarde.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor. The prosecution feels that it would be premature to pass down a verdict at this time.\nJudge:\nWh-What...?\nEdgeworth:\nThe reason is quite simple. This witness has yet to speak the absolute, real truth.\nJudge:\nThe \"absolute, real truth\"...? What are you...?\nEdgeworth:\nWitness... Don't you understand yet?\nAndrews:\n...Huh?\nEdgeworth:\nI don't know who planted this silly idea in your head, but as long as you \"protect\" yourself through your silence, Matt Engarde will go free. And in his place... YOU will become the guilty party!\nAndrews:\n...Th-That's... That's a lie! I... I don't believe you!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat...?\nAndrews:\nI... I was told... If I spoke... If I spoke, then it would be all over... And Matt would never be declared guilty...\nPhoenix:\n(Wh-What in the world is she talking about!? Has she lost it!?)\nAndrews:\nI... I can't speak about it... I'm too scared...\nMia:\nIt's Franziska von Karma...\nPhoenix:\nHuh...?\nMia:\nDon't you rememeber, Phoenix? Ms. Andrews lives by gripping tightly onto the words of another. Because she doesn't have the strength to believe in herself.\nPhoenix:\nTh...Then, right now... Ms. Andrews is...\nMia:\nYesterday, she was tossed a life-saver by Ms. von Karma. \"Don't say a word, no matter what happens. If you do, Matt Engarde will be acquitted.\" Ms. Andrews undyingly believes in those words right now, and is clinging onto them...\nPhoenix:\n(Th-Then what should we do!? This... This is the first time I've ever come across anything like this! But Ms. Andrews has to be the killer, right!? All we have to do now is... is get our not guilty... That is my only priority!)\nAndrews:\nIt wasn't me! I'm begging you, please believe me! I didn't kill Juan! Help... Please... Someone... Help me...!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nThe court can't continue on like this, therefore I'd like to hear what you intend to do.\nPhoenix:\n(What I intend to do...!? Wh-What am I supposed to do!? What am I supposed to say!?)\nEdgeworth:\nWright! I suggest you think very carefully about this! Think about what this witness did, and what she did NOT do! And think about who is the real mastermind behind this crime!\nPhoenix:\n(Who's the real mastermind? Isn't that obvious!? There's no one else it could be except the woman crying over there! ...Right?)\nEdgeworth:\nCome now! What will you do!? What kind of man are you, Mr. Phoenix Wright!?\nJudge:\nThat's enough! I commend you for trying, Mr. Edgeworth. However, it's clear that the defense's theory is the truth.\nAndrews:\n...Y...You're wrong...\nEdgeworth:\n... What a shame... (Changed from [Such a shame...] in the original release)\nAndrews:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nI had hoped things wouldn't come to this, however...\nJudge:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Andrews. Since you absolutely refuse to testify... It falls on my shoulders to disclose this to the court.\nAndrews:\n...S...Stop...\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\nThis witness... How should I put this... She has an illness.\nAndrews:\nWhat!?\nEdgeworth:\nAnd because of this illness, she has tried to commit suicide in the past.\nAndrews:\nS-Stop... Please stop...!\nEdgeworth:\nNo matter how much you want to hide it, it's no use. I have the evidence right here.\nAndrews:\nAh! Th-That's...!\nPhoenix:\n(That's the second part of the suicide report -- the attempted suicide report!)\nEdgeworth:\nWhat will you do now, witness? You know what I am about to do, don't you? I will now reveal to the court, the true nature of the pitiful woman known as Adrian Andrews!\nPhoenix:\n(The secret of her dependent nature... (Changed from [The secret of her co-dependant [sic] nature...] in the original release) Having other people know about it scares her more than anything else in the world...)\nAndrews:\nPlease! Please STOP!! I beg you!! If people find out... If people find out... I... I'll...\nEdgeworth:\nIf you're going to say you would \"choose death\", that is of no concern to me.\nAndrews:\n...!\nPhoenix:\n(Edgeworth... How can you be so cold...!?)\nEdgeworth:\nHowever, before you die... I will pull the truth from your still-breathing lips! (Changed from [I will pull the truth from your breathing lips!] in the original release) ... No matter what I have to do.\nAndrews:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nSo, will you tell the court yourself, or shall I!? Either is fine with me.\nAndrews:\n... ... ...I... I'll talk. But please... Help me... N-Nothing matters anymore...\nWitness Testimony\n-- My \"Crime\" --\nAndrews:\nWhen I first saw him... I really thought he had fainted. Honest.\nWhen I realized he was dead... That was when I formulated my plan.\nOnce I made sure there was no one in the hallway, I made a dash back to Matt's room.\nAnd then... I stabbed Juan's dead body with the knife, and ripped off the button.\nJust when I finished and was returning to Matt's room... I had a bit of an inconvenience.\nAnd that's why... That's why I ended up using the Nickel Samurai costume.\nJudge:\nS-Stabbed the body!? With the knife!? But why would you do that!?\nAndrews:\nIsn't it obvious? To pin the blame on a certain person... A certain cowardly man!\nJudge:\nWh... What do you mean by all of this...?\nEdgeworth:\nIt might take this court a little while to understand, but... This is the truth.\nAndrews:\nThe real killer is Matt! That scumbag of a man! I'll never forgive him! He's trying to escape his guilt again! Just like last time!\nPhoenix:\n(\"Last time\"...?)\nEdgeworth:\nSo, Ms. Andrews stabbed the victim, Juan Corrida, in the chest with the knife. However, she didn't do it with murder in mind. She did it with the intent of framing Matt Engarde for the murder... And this! This is her \"crime\"!\nPhoenix:\n(Wh-WHAT!? How is this possible!? I mean... Wasn't Ms. Andrews supposed to be the real murderer!?)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. Please get over your shock and commence the cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- My \"Crime\" --\nAndrews:\nWhen I first saw him... I really thought he had fainted. Honest.\nAndrews:\nWhen I realized he was dead... That was when I formulated my plan.\nAndrews:\nOnce I made sure there was no one in the hallway, I made a dash back to Matt's room.\nAndrews:\nAnd then... I stabbed Juan's dead body with the knife, and ripped off the button.\nAndrews:\nJust when I finished and was returning to Matt's room... I had a bit of an inconvenience.\nAndrews:\nAnd that's why... That's why I ended up using the Nickel Samurai costume.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't want to concede, but this testimony... it rings of the truth...)\nMia:\nI'm sorry, Phoenix...\nPhoenix:\nN-No, please, don't apologize to me. We were both taken by surprise.\nMia:\nStill, I'm sorry...\nAfter pressing all statements:\nJudge:\nI think we've heard enough! So, after that, you went back to Mr. Engarde's room and planted the button?\nAndrews:\n...Into Matt's hakama? Yes. After that, I folded up the costume I was wearing and put it into a bag. Then I snuck it out of the hotel and got rid of it.\nJudge:\nM-My word... What does all this mean...?\nAndrews:\n...Mr. Edgeworth, is it?\nEdgeworth:\n...\nAndrews:\nThe real criminal... is Matt Engarde!! Yesterday... That woman prosecutor sat me down for a talk...\nPhoenix:\n(Franziska, huh...)\nAndrews:\nShe said that I should, under no circumstances, confess to what I had done. That if I just kept quiet, then Matt would be found guilty for sure... I... I had no choice but to believe in her words...\nPhoenix:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n...\n...............\nJudge:\nWhat this witness has done is clearly unlawful. However... As long as her testimony stands, we can be certain she is not the real killer!\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait, Your Honor! The defense still...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nWright.\nPhoenix:\n!\nEdgeworth:\nIt's pointless. At this point in time, it is not possible to indict Ms. Andrews on anything.\nJudge:\nYes, exactly. There isn't a single piece of evidence that points to her as the murderer. The cross-examination of this witness is over. And so is today's trial. You couldn't establish that the witness was the culprit. Please let it go, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nB-But!\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth, please place Ms. Andrews under arrest for further questioning.\nEdgeworth:\nUnderstood, Your Honor. The prosecution will arrange for her detention immediately.\nJudge:\nThat's all. Court is adjourned for today!\nPhoenix:\n(Today's... Today's trial... It's over...! And I didn't win an acquittal!)\nEdgeworth:\nWitness... Would you mind if I asked you something?\nPhoenix:\n...! (Edgeworth...?)\nAndrews:\nWhat is it...?\nEdgeworth:\nBefore you leave court today, I wondered if I might look at one thing. The card in your hand. It's had my interest for quite some time now. What exactly is it...?\nAndrews:\nOh, this...? Mr. Wright also asked about this. Although I didn't remember at the time you asked me about it, Mr. Wright, I remembered just now. I found this in the room on that day.\nPhoenix:\n\"The room\"...?\nEdgeworth:\n\"That day\"...?\nAndrews:\nYes. I found this card when I discovered Juan's body. It was lying there right next to him...\nPhoenix:\nYou found that card... next to the victim's body?\nAndrews:\nI suppose I must have unconsciously slipped it into my pocket... ...But it's not as if this card has any relevance to Juan's murder, right?\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, I guess not. But it's still a strange card, if you ask me... But as far as a clue to this case...? I don't see why...)\n???:\nEdgeworth:\nWitness! That card... Give it to me! Hurry!\nPhoenix:\nE-Edgeworth...?\nEdgeworth:\nDo you have any idea what you have stupidly, yet inadvertently done!? This... I can't believe you hid this from me all this time!\nAndrews:\nI... I didn't mean to...\nMia:\nWh-What is this all about...?\nPhoenix:\n(I've never seen Edgeworth so emotional before... (Changed from [I've never seen such an emotional Edgeworth in my entire life...] in the original release) That card... What in the world is it? And what does it mean...!?)\nTo be continued."

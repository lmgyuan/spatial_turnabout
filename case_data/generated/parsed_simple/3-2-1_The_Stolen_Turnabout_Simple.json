You can clean the toilet later! This is important!\nPhoenix:\n*sigh* What are you freaking out about now?\nMaya:\nHey hee. Today will be the last time you talk to me that way!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMaya:\nWe're about to hit the big time!\nPhoenix:\n\"Big time\"? And what do you mean by \"we\"? You don't mean you and me are...?\nMaya:\nHa! Don't be silly. I'm talking about me and Pearly, of course!\nPearl:\nHello. It's a pleasure to see you again, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nPearls! You haven't changed a bit! Wait... What are you doing here anyway?\nPearl:\nHee hee. Haven't you heard, Mr. Nick? Here! Take a look at this!\nPhoenix:\n(What's this...? Some kind of poster?) Kurain Village... Isn't that...?\nMaya:\nThat's right. It's our hometown... Pearly and mine, that is.\nPhoenix:\nWhat's this about \"treasures\" from the boonies?\nMaya:\nHa ha ha. Very funny. You can laugh all you want... But you'll be singing another tune tonight!\nPhoenix:\nTonight? What about tonight?\nPearl:\nThe \"Treasures of Kurain\" exhibit doesn't actually start until next week, but... ...the promoter sent us some special VIP entry passes!\nMaya:\nThat's why I dressed up extra special today! What do you think, Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Heh. Same Maya. Different day.) This young lady here is Maya Fey... The younger sister of Mia Fey... ...My friend and mentor. I first met her two years ago... I was working on the case surrounding Mia's death, and ever since then...\nMaya:\nI've been the one who's been keeping this law office afloat from behind the scenes.\nPhoenix:\nActually that's just a cover for her true identity... In reality, she's a spirit medium, and a bit of a shady character.\nMaya:\nHey! Who are you calling \"shady\"!?\nPhoenix:\nAnd this little girl is Pearl Fey, but I usually call her \"Pearls\". She's Maya's cousin and a spirit medium in training herself.\nPearl:\nI know I'm a bit young, but I want to help in any way I can, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nKurain Village is the home of the mysterious Kurain Channelling Technique. And Maya here is the daughter of the Kurain School of Channeling's Master. ...I know it sounds ridiculous, but it's no joke. I've seen her power with my own eyes... It's the real thing alright.\nMaya:\nEarth to Nick! How long are you going to make two gorgeous women like us wait!?\nPearl:\nYes, Mr. Nick! I can't wait any longer! I want to see the exhibit!\nPhoenix:\n(*sigh* Looks like I don't get a choice here.

The city's fanciest and most expensive department store. Treasure Exhibit, huh... I have to admit I'm pretty impressed.)\nMaya: \nWow... This is awesome!\nPhoenix: \nYeah... You can make even the cheapest junk look great... It all depends on how you display it.\nPearl: \nOh! They even have the dusty old hanging scroll that was in the Fey Manor storeroom!\nMaya:  \nOh yeah, I remember scribbling on it when I was a little girl!\nPhoenix:\n(On a family heirloom...!?)\nMaya:  \nSay, Nick... The person in charge of this exhibition is waiting for us in the basement warehouse.\nPhoenix:  \nAlright...

I feel like a monster could jump out at any time...\nMaya:\nDon't be scared, Pearly! I'll protect you!\n???:\n...Oh... ...Mr. Wright.\nMaya:\nEeeeeeeek!! A monster! You were right!\nPhoenix: \n(Huh? A monster...?)\n???: \nGood evening. ...It's good to see you again.\nPhoenix: \nY-You... I know you...\n???: \nHa ha. Nice to see you again too, little miss.\nPearl: \nAh! H-Hello!\nMaya: \nIs she a friend of yours, Nick? ...And how do you know her, Pearly?\nAndrews: \nNice to meet you. I'm Adrian Andrews.

Have you all eaten yet?\nPhoenix: \nUm, well actually...\nAndrews: \nI've already made a reservation at the restaurant on the 12th floor. Why don't we all dine together?\nMaya: \nOoh! I like the sound of that! \"Dine\"... It sounds so fancy!\nPearl: \nI'll have the \"Kid's Lunch\"!\nMaya: \nHa ha ha. Pearly, it's dinner, not lunch. Why don't you go for it and really eat your fill with a \"Kid's Dinner\"?\nPearl: \nOK! In that case, one \"Kid's Dinner\" for me!\nAndrews: \nHa ha. Shall we head upstairs, then?\nPhoenix: \nAfter that pleasant evening, all that remained was to wait for the exhibition's opening. It was wonderful seeing Ms. Andrews looking so happy.

You're cleaning the toilet again!? I never knew you were such a toilet freak!\nPhoenix:  \nGimme a break, would you? My brain just hit the snooze button for the fifth time...\nPearl: \nUm... I'm going to turn on the TV!\nAnnouncer:  \n...We've got an update on the recent treasure heist!

This is the fifth heist by the phantom thief, who only targets rare treasures.\nPhoenix:  \nL-Lordly Tailor...!?\nMaya:  \nWell, Nick!? What are you going to do!? Don't you dare go back to scrubbing the toilet!\nPhoenix:  \nTreasure...? Lordly Tailor...? You don't think...!?\nMaya:  \nYes! Now, get up, Nick! It was stolen! By Mask☆DeMasque!

Let's see if we can find some clues that might lead us to the bad guy!\nPhoenix: \n...But it doesn't look like anything has been disturbed.\nMaya: \nYeah, it looks pretty much the same as it did last night.\nPearl: \nHmmm... Bad guy, huh.\n???: \nHey! You can't poke around here, pal!\nPhoenix: \nWait a minute... that voice. Oh no! Not him again!\n???: \nIt's YOU!! And I'm the one who should be saying \"not again\"! Why is it that every time something bad happens, you always show up, pal?\nPhoenix: \nI should be asking you that. Aren't there any other detectives?\n???: \nNo, I should be asking YOU that. What are you doing hanging around here?\nPhoenix: \nHey, I asked you first. Why are you here any--\nMaya: \nAlright, alright, we got it! Why don't you two kiss and make up already?\nPearl: \n...Um, hello. It's been a long time, Mr. Scruffy Detective!\n???: \nOh! It's you, little missy! ...Um, ahh...\nGumshoe:\nActually, my name is Gumshoe. \"Detective Dick Gumshoe\"! Now is a good chance for you to try to remember it right!\nMaya: \nAnd if it's too long for you, you can just call him \"Dick\".\nPearl: \nOkay! It's good to see you again, Mr. Detective Dick!\nGumshoe: \nUm... Yeah...

To protect the art pieces, you know.\n???: \n...Welcome! To my private little \"Banquet of Chaos\".\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? What the heck does THAT mean...?)\n???: \nI'm afraid I have very little to offer, but please... make yourself at home.\nMaya: \nErr, umm... Who are you anyway...?\n???: \nSHHH! SILENCE! ...

The universal skeptic would say that how is nothing but a question of why. I am traveler of both time and space, and a swimmer of dreams.\nMaya: \nWhat is he talking about? I can't make heads or tails of it...\n???: \nWithout further ado, let me fulfill what should be the first duty of any gentleman...\nAtmey:\n...and introduce myself. The name is Atmey...

I've been told that you too are pursuing the mysterious thief.\nPhoenix:\n...Well, I'm not sure would say that exact--\nMaya:\nThat's right! We're going to find the Sacred Urn no matter what we have to do!\nAtmey:\n...Excellent. I will trust you. I permit you to take a look around while I investigate elsewhere.

You captured Mask☆DeMasque!?\nGumshoe:\nBingoooo! Well... Actually, he surrendered... ...But I still got him!\nPhoenix:\n(Mask☆DeMasque surrendered?)\nPearl:\nThat's great! So when can we come and pick up the Sacred Urn?\nGumshoe:\nUm, ahh, well ya see... I was gonna tell you...\nPhoenix:\nWhat...? Something wrong?\nGumshoe:\nDo you think you can swing by the detention center sometime?\nPhoenix:\nThe detention center...? (Changed from [Detention center...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nHe wants to talk to you... Mask☆DeMasque, that is.\nMaya:\nWhaaaat!? He wants to talk to Nick?\nGumshoe:\nI'll be waiting for you, pal. So get over here soon.\nPhone:\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\n(The detention center, huh?)\nOctober 12Atmey Detective Agency\nPhoenix:\nThis is a detective agency?

Let's take that framed picture back with us as a memento!\nPhoenix:\nDon't you dare, Maya! (Guess we'll have to try back later...)\nOctober 12\nDetention CenterVisitor's Room\nGumshoe:\nHey, pal!

So where's the Sacred Urn?\nGumshoe:\nOh, Sorry about that, pal... I guess I didn't really think about it before... But you're the \"victim\" in this case.\nMaya:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nWell, I guess I should let you guys hear the story straight from the horse's mouth.\nMaya:\nYou know, he's right, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nHe is?\nMaya:\nIf you think about it reeeeal hard, we are the victims!\nPhoenix:\nWell... I guess so... In a way...\n???:\nUmm...\nMaya:\nI'm so used to thinking of the victim as a dead person 'cause we're always on murder cases.\n???:\nEx-Excuse me...\nMaya:\nBut anyway! I have to get the Sacred Urn back!\n???:\nPleeeeease! Don't just ignore meeeeee! ...Err.\nMaya:\n...Um, who are you?\n???:\n...I, err, umm. I-I-I... I-I'm Ma-Ma-Ma...

Your husband told us that you wanted us to stop by.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nI'm Maya Fey, and this is Phoenix Wright, attorney at law.\nDesirée:\n\"Nicky boy\" and Maya, huh? I can't tell you how grateful I am that you decided to help my Ronnie.\nMaya:\nWell, um... Aha ha... You're welcome.\nPhoenix:\n(Did she really call me \"Nicky boy\"?)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nDesirée:\nSay... Can I ask you something, Nicky boy?\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it?\nDesirée:\nI know I may seem like a \"bad girl\" on the outside... But the one thing I won't stand for is illegal activity.\nMaya:\nI had the feeling you wouldn't! You're tough... But I can tell you've got a good heart. (Changed from [I had the feeling you didn't! You're tough... But I can tell you've got a good heart.] in the original release)\nDesirée:\nSomebody framed my poor Ronnie, I just know it. Umm... Could you give this to Ronnie for me?\nMaya:\nA letter?\nDesirée:\nYes, for Ronnie. I want him to fight back.\nMaya:\nMs. DeLite... OK, you've got it!

Could you please take my case? My trial starts tomorrow...\nMaya:\nHey, hang on a second! He can't be your lawyer!\nPhoenix:\nWhy not?\nMaya:\nWhat do you mean, \"why not\"!? We're the victims in this case, right!? Victims of this DeMasque guy!\nPhoenix:\nWell, yeah... But according to Desirée, he didn't do it...\nPearl:\nShe said, \"Poor man, he's deluded himself into thinking he did it.\" Right, Mr. Nick?\nMaya:\nCome on! She could be lying to protect her husband!\nPhoenix:\nW-Well, that's true. ...Err, no actually not. Actually it's hard to say (...Oh no, it's spreading!)\nRon:\nOh, please! I'll give you the treasure of your choice in return...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... What should I do?)\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick...! I-I was wrong about you...

From the bottom of my heart, I apologize for what I said!\nPhoenix:\nAww, it's OK! I'm the one that should be apologizing!\nPearl:\nWell, I'm going out now for a little bit.\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? Wh-Where are you going...?\nPearl:\nI may be small, but I still have a lot of spirit channeling power! So I'm going to show you I can be useful too... By finding some evidence!\nPhoenix:\nHey!

A lawyer, and... a spirit medium. ...Am I correct?\nMaya:\n...Umm. I think we've already been through this.\nAtmey:\nHa! So my estimation was correct! Zvarri! ...How truly elegant. Now then, what can I do for you?\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\nWell it looks like we got one thing cleared up anyway.\nMaya:\nHuh? What? That Atmey is the greatest Ace Detective in the world?\nPhoenix:\nNo, that he never actually saw the thief.\nMaya:\nOh... that's right! So the thief may not even be Mask☆DeMasque...\nAtmey:\nJust one moment, Sir Lawyer! The thief was unquestionably Mask☆DeMasque!\nMaya:\nBut you never actually saw him!\nAtmey:\nPerhaps so, but I installed a security camera for just such a contingency.\nMaya:\nOh...\nAtmey:\nLast night, the camera went off exactly once. Behold! This is a photo of the dastardly thief, taken by the security camera!\nPhoenix:\n...Th-That's him!\nMaya:\nM-Mask☆DeMasque...!\nSecurity Camera Photo added to the Court Record.\nAtmey:\nThe thief can be none other than the arch-criminal, Mask☆DeMasque.

Nick! Remember what Detective Atmey said!?\nAtmey:\nExactly that. Mr. DeLite had a very good reason to dress up and commit those crimes.

Ever since grade school, he's been... Not exactly a close friend, but yeah, we know each other.\nButz:\nHey, man, that wasn't nice! I was your very first client!\nPhoenix:\nWe've got quite the... storied history, he and I.

This is an important investigation!\nPhoenix:\n(That's true... And truth be told, I have to admit I am kind of curious...)\nMaya:\nWell? What's in there?\nPhoenix:\nH-Hang on a sec. I'm taking it out now... (Whatever it is, it feels... kinda hard... and smooth...)\nAtmey:\n...Well, hello there!!\nMaya:\nEEEEEEK! H-He's here!\nAtmey:\n...What are you doing, Sir Lawyer? I'm shocked to see a servant of the court ignoring the law so flagrantly!\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm really sorry! M-Maya made me do it!\nMaya:\nNick! I can't believe you!\nAtmey:\nA gentlemen never uses a lady as an excuse for his own poor behavior... The real question is... Can you afford to waste time lollygagging about here?\nPhoenix:\nWh-What do you mean by that?\nAtmey:\nPerhaps I should make myself more clear? Tomorrow's trial... Zvarri! Shall we say the figurative Sir William will be dropping his panties before lunchtime?\nMaya:\nWow, Nick! Sounds like it's gonna be really exciting.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\n(It looks like we're done investigating for the day.)\nAtmey:\nHee hee hee hee hee... Sir Lawyer... The stage has been set and all the pieces are finally in place. All that remains now... is for the dance to begin!\nPhoenix:\n(A new prosecutor, an Ace Detective and a thief... This will be one tough trial.)\nTo be continued."

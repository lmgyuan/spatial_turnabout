What is it, Pearls?\nPearl:\nDoes magic have anything to do with channeling spirits?\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think it has anything to do with channeling...) You don't know about magic, do you Pearls?\nPearl:\nI'm sorry...\nPhoenix:\n(I braved the winter cold and took Pearls to see the circus. It's been six months since the incident in Kurain Village... and it was during that trying time that I met Pearls... (Changed from [It was during that terrible time that I met Pearls...] in the original release) Thankfully, she seems to be recovering from it, and is returning to her normal self. (Changed from [It seems like she is starting to get back to normal...] in the original release))\nMaya:\nAhh... It's time to go.\nPearl:\nYou're right. We can't miss the last train.\nPhoenix:\nPearls! You remembered the train!\nPearl:\nOf course I did! But I don't really understand what everyone means by \"express train\".\nMaya:\nWell, Nick...

You have to turn on the TV!\nPhoenix:\n(The TV?)\nTV:\n...Now let's check in at the scene!\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? What happened...?)\nTV:\n...Thank you. We're here at the Berry Big Circus.

They arrested him too!\nPhoenix:\nA-Arrested who?\nMaya:\nMax! They arrested Max Galactica!!\nPhoenix:\n(Maximillion Galactica. Fans call him Max. A popular magician who can fly through the sky at will... Maya said she was a huge fan of Max...)\nMaya:\nAlright Nick! I'll see you in two hours at the Detention Center.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?

You've still got plenty of time to clean up your office later!\nPhoenix:\nW-WWWHHHAATTT!?\nPhone:\n...*beep*...\nDecember 28, 11:19 AMDetention CenterVisitor's Room\nMaya:\nWhat are they talking about? Why did they arrest Max?\nPhoenix:\nYou're asking the wrong man on that one, Maya. Maybe he used his magical skills to deal death with a slight [sic] of hand...\nMaya:\nMaximillion Galactica would never do such a thing!!\n???:\nFABULOUS!! What the young lady just said was absolutely fabulous! What a clever girl! Such a fabulous understanding of events!\nPhoenix:\n(...What's with all this fabulous talk...)\nMax:\nWelcome to the Visitor's Room!\nMaya:\nIt's MAX!! Nick!! Look!

I want this one.\nMax:\nSo sweetie, let's be honest here... You came to this visitor's room to visit me, didn't you?\nMaya:\nY-Yes! I'm your biggest fan!!\nMax:\nFabulous! Absolutely fabulous! Thank you so much!!\nPhoenix:\nHey... Umm... What about my card?\nMax:\nThink of it as a souvenir.\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nWell Nick... I think it's time to get to work.\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nWhat's the matter, Nick? Why are you looking at the ceiling?\nPhoenix:\nI was just thinking about what I should have for lunch.\nMax:\nSweetie... Drop porcupine head over there. Shower me with your attention. OK?\nMaya:\nO-O-O-Oh, yes...! (Changed from [Y-Y-Y-Yes...] in the original release)\nMax:\nAb-so-lute-ly... FABULOUS!!\nPhoenix:\n(Absolutely cringe inducing.)\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Attorney's Badge:\nMax:\n... Anyways... I've been curious about something for a while now.\nMaya:\nWhat's that?\nMax:\nWhy do you keep looking at me with such a sad look on your face, sweetie?\nMaya:\nBe-Because! You've been arrested! For murder!\nMax:\nOh, don't be ignorant. They wouldn't arrest someone like me!!\nPhoenix:\nWhy is that?\nMax:\nObviously because I'm the fabulous Maximillion Galactica!\nPhoenix:\nSo?\nMax:\nI'm the very big star of the Berry Big Circus.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that means?\nMax:\nI'm rich. I'm paid fabulous sums!\nPhoenix:\nWhich means what?\nMax:\n...\nMaya:\nMax...\nMax:\nQuit joking around! You've got to be pulling my magic wand! The police aren't really serious about all this, are they?\nPhoenix:\nThey don't arrest people as a joke.\nMax:\n...!!\nMaya:\nLook at Max... He's crushed...\nPhoenix:\nWell he needed to wake up and smell the coffee. (This is serious business.)\nMax:\nUmm... Umm...\nPhoenix:\nYes?\nMax:\nPorcu... I mean, Sir. You're a lawyer, right?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Oh, yeah. I'm an attorney.\nMax:\nPlease! Help me! I didn't kill nobody!\nMaya:\n\"Didn't kill nobody!?\"\nMax:\nI may be more spoiled than a hog in a hamburger mud pit... But a killer!? That's insane... I... I... I could never...\nMaya:\nM-Max?\nMax:\nI swear!! I just wanted to pay off my daddy's debt... He's back on the farm...\nPhoenix:\nOK... OK... I'll take your case.\nMax:\nR-Really?\nPhoenix:\nReally.\nMax:\nUh... Thank ya much. Ya'll sure are nice folks.\nMaya:\nUmm... Max.\nMax:\nYes?\nMaya:\nWhat's your real name?\nMax:\nIt's Billy Bob Johns...\nMaya:\n............ (Changed from [... Ugh...] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nWhat's the matter, Maya?\nMaya:\nHe's really just a country bumpkin!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMax:\n...Ahem. I must apologize for not being my absolutely fabulous self just now, sweetie.\nMaya:\nH-Huh?\nMax:\nMr. Attorney.\nPhoenix:\nYes?\nMax:\nA few minutes ago, you took one of my cards, didn't you?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Now that he mentions it... I did take a card.)\nMax:\nIt was the 10 of Hearts. Right?\nPhoenix:\n(Wha... How'd he... He got it right, again!)\nMax:\nWhat can I say? You, too... You've stolen some of my most valued possessions. Ten of Maximillion Galactica's hearts...\nPhoenix:\n(You sure do have a lot of hearts, don't you?)\nMax:\nAh ha ha ha... I'm putting my faith in you sweetie.\nPhoenix:\n(He didn't just call me sweetie, did he?)\nMaya:\nAlright! Let's make this an absolutely fabulous case! C'mon, Nick!\nDecember 28Wright & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nAlright... We've got lots of things we have to look into. No time for slacking. Let's get going.\nMaya:\nOK.\nPhoenix:\n? What's the matter? You seem down.\nMaya:\nMaximilion Galactica... Who would have guessed he was country bumpkin?\nDecember 28Berry Big CircusCircus Entrance\nMaya:\nWe're here again...\nPhoenix:\nYep. But this time we are here for work. (It hasn't been that long since the crime, so the police are still on the scene.)\nMaya:\nLet's find someone who might know something about what happened.\nPhoenix:\nSounds like a plan.\nDecember 28Lodging HousePlaza\nPhoenix:\nThis seems to be a dorm where all the performers in the circus stay...\nMaya:\nReally!? So we might run into that stoogey clown here, right? He's so kooky! (Changed from [Really!? So that stoogey clown should be here, huh? He's so kooky!] in the original release)\n???:\nAhhh! It's you two!\nMaya:\nOh... Detective Gumshoe!\nGumshoe:\nHow is it you guys always seem to know when I'm working a crime scene, pal? (Changed from [I always see you hanging around when I'm working a crime scene, pal.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nBecause you're always working, Detective. (Changed from [You always seem to be working so hard, Detective.] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nWell, I'd rather not be always working, but with crime, you don't make your own hours. (Changed from [I'd rather not be working hard, but with crime you don't make your own hours.] in the original release) If I have to be at the circus anyway, I want to see the lion tamer and the tightrope. However, no matter where I go, the show is always the same... Dead body. Stage left.\nMaya:\nNick! Nick! He complained!!\nPhoenix:\nHeh heh... That's a rarity. Let's get back to business now, OK?\nAfter clearing \"The eyewitness\" Talk option in Lodging House - Plaza:\nDecember 28Lodging Hall 1st FloorMoe's Room\nPhoenix:\nI wonder whose room this is. (Changed from [This is it?] in the original release)\nMaya:\nThe nametag on the door says \"Moe\" on it.\nPhoenix:\nI guess he's not here...\nMaya:\nWow... It's a real mess in here!\nPhoenix:\n(My room's probably worse though...)\nMaya:\nOh well... I give up. We'll have to come back later.\nDecember 28Berry Big CircusBig Top\nPhoenix:\nThe circus stage sure doesn't look this small from out in the audience...\nMaya:\nWow... This is where they all perform, isn't it? Nick! Do some somersaults!\nPhoenix:\nI'm not doing any somersaults.\nMaya:\nWhy not!? You look like you'd be great at it!\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I look like I'd be great at somersaults!?)\n???:\nGrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...\nMaya:\nHuh? Nick?\nPhoenix:\nIt wasn't me.\n???:\nGrrrrrrrrrrr... Grawwwwwww!!\nMaya:\nT-T-T-T-T-T-T... TIGER!!\nPhoenix:\nH-H-H-He's c-c-coming this way!!\n???:\nGrrrrrrrrr... Grawwwwwww!!\nPhoenix:\nAHHHHHHHHHHH!!\nMaya:\nNick! You're too young to die! NICK!!\n???:\nSTAY! STAY! HEEL!\n???:\nGrrrrrrrrr...\nPhoenix:\n(I'm still here... I'm not dead, yet!!)\nMaya:\nN-Nick! Nick! Are you OK?\n???:\nAhahaha! Scared ya didn't I? Regent is such a cute tiger! Isn't he!?\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\n...\n???:\nWhat's the matter? You two sure are quiet.\nMaya:\nDon't \"What's the matter?\" me! N-Nick... He almost died there!!\n???:\nHah! He wasn't anywhere close to getting hurt, let alone dying! This little tiger hardly ever bites people. And besides, people normally never get to play with a wild tiger, right? So if you think about it, you're actually really lucky!\nPhoenix:\nHuh!?\n???:\nYou agree, don't you?\nPhoenix:\n... I guess...\nMaya:\nW-W-W-What do you mean you guess!? Why are you agreeing with her?\n???:\nWoohoo!! Your costume...\nMaya:\nEh?\n???:\nIt's cute. I wanna try it on!!\nMaya:\nC-Costume? You mean my clothes...?\n???:\nYou don't mind letting me try it on, right?\nMaya:\nUhh... I guess not...\n???:\nREALLY!? Hehehehehe!! You're the best!\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... The tables turned quickly on that one. So much for the tiger thing...)\n???:\nOh! I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Regina Berry... The renowned animal tamer of the Berry Big Circus!\nMaya:\nMy name's Maya Fey. I'm a spirit medium.\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix Wright. Attorney at law. (When you put us up next to an animal tamer, I bet we really look odd!)\nRegina:\nNice to meet ya!\nPhoenix:\nUhh... Likewise...\nDetention Center\nAfter clearing \"Something unusual\" and \"The eyewitness\" Talk options in Lodging House - Plaza, and visiting Big Top:\nDecember 28Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nMaya:\n... Max isn't here.\nPhoenix:\nHe must be in questioning.\nMaya:\nAww... I wanted to see a magic trick.\nPhoenix:\nHe should be back in a little bit.\nMaya:\nI guess so.\nLodging House - Plaza\nWright & Co. Law Offices\nAfter presenting Russell Berry profile in Berry Big Circus - Big Top:\nDecember 28Big TopRingmaster's Room\nMaya:\nThis was the Ringmaster's room?\nPhoenix:\nYes. This room belonged to the victim. Which means this must be where Max met the Ringmaster last night.\nMaya:\nNow that you mention it, that is what he said.\nPhoenix:\nI wonder what... Hmm... That's an interesting poster. (Changed from [I wonder what... Hmm... That's an intresting [sic] poster.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nAh! It's a poster of Max! I want it! I want it! Nick!

Ha... Huh? M-Me?\nPhoenix:\nYes. You work at the circus don't you?\n???:\nN-No. I'm just your everyday average Joe.\nMaya:\nAn average Joe who just happens to hang out at the circus? I don't think so.\n???:\nY-Yes I am. I've got nothing to do with what's going on here.\nPhoenix:\n(He's lying. Like any regular person would hang around the circus... Dressed like that!) I'm an attorney. My name is Phoenix Wright.\nMaya:\nI'm a spirit medium. My name is Maya.\n???:\nWell... I... Um... Just happened to be... Umm... Passing by...\nPhoenix:\nI don't suppose you happen to be some kind of carny?\n???:\nNot a c-c-carny... I-I'm a p-performer. Actually, I'm a v-v-v-ventriloquist.\nMaya:\nVentriloquist?\n???:\nHe-he-he-he-he-he-he... I-I-I'm Benjamin Wo-Wo-Wo-Woodman...\nMaya:\nYour last name is Woodman? *snicker* (Changed from [You're [sic] last name is Woodman? *snicker*] in the original release)\n???:\nY-Yes... T-T-That's right... But e-everyone c-c-calls me B-B-B-B-B-Ben.\nMaya:\nAh... Yes yes yes... That's your alias, right?\nPhoenix:\nI believe they call it a stage name.\nBig Top\nWright & Co.

Aha!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMoe:\nI welched on giving you more than one!!\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nMoe:\nNo no no! If it was funny, it is your duty as a human being to laugh!! People who don't laugh are usually last-seen in Lan-sing. Catch my drift? Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Maya?\nMaya:\nAha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nPhoenix:\n(This is like some Faustian nightmare...)\nMaya:\nC'mon! It was funny! Clowns are always funny in my book!\nPhoenix:\nIn my book, they're just funny lookin'.\nMoe:\nYou sure do have a great taste in clothes girlie! Look at that garb! You look just like Gretta Garb... OH! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nPhoenix:\n*sigh* I'm goin' home...\nMaya:\nNo! Nick! You can't!!\nPhoenix:\nYou know, I can excuse a bad joke or two... But this stooge keeps laughing at his own jokes! That's what I object to!\nMaya:\nOK OK... I get it. But you have to admit he is kinda funny...\nPhoenix:\n(Argghhh... No, I do not have to admit that, because he isn't!)\nMoe:\nAha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nWright & Co. Law Offices\nBig Top\nAfter presenting Max profile in Lodging Hall 1st Floor - Moe's Room:\nDecember 28Big TopCafeteria\nMaya:\nEww... This place is gross.\nPhoenix:\nThis must be because of last night. They didn't have time to clean up after dinner because of the murder.\nMaya:\nThat reminds me... What was it that Moe said?\nPhoenix:\nHe said that yesterday morning Max \"clonked\" Ben over the head here.\nMaya:\nHe also said that, \"There's Gotti be something interesting there.\" Nick? What's \"Gotti be interesting?\"\nPhoenix:\nDon't ask...\nMaya:\nHmph!\nAfter examining posters and table in Big Top - Ringmaster's Room and clearing all Talk options in Lodging Hall 1st Floor - Moe's Room:\nDecember 28Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nMax:\nOh!

Ben's not here anymore!\nPhoenix:\nYeah... I wanted to ask him something.\nMaya:\nIt's cold out... He's probably in the tent.\nDecember 28Berry Big CircusBig Top\nMaya:\nWhat do you think, Nick? I wonder if we've been making any progress...\nPhoenix:\nDon't be so negative... Of course we are making progress.\nMaya:\nBut... Everyone loved the Ringmaster... And there's no sign of footprints on the scene... There's still a lot of mysteries left to be solved.\nPhoenix:\nOf course.\nMaya:\nAnd now Regina isn't here!\nPhoenix:\nI'm not seeing how that's related...\nDecember 28Big TopRingmaster's Room\nMaya:\nIt looks the same as always... A great big mess. Considering how messy it is, I bet they wouldn't notice if another poster went missing.\nPhoenix:\nWill you just stop it, you poster pilferer!\nMaya:\nI'm just kidding! You know I already got one of these posters!!\nPhoenix:\nYou mean \"stole\" one of those posters!\nMaya:\nYeah... Uh... Let's focus on what Max told us.

Now try speaking to me again, but this time with some proper respect!\nPhoenix:\n(Not again... *sigh*) Mr. Quist... Is that better?\nTrilo:\nNo! Look at me when I am talking to you, you 8-bit excuse for an attorney!\nBen:\nTrilo! We talked about insulting people! You promised!!\nTrilo:\nBut he was mocking me!

Being mean to bullies was not included in the deal!] in the original release)\nBen:\nI'm sorry, Trilo...\nMaya:\nNick! What just happened? Trilo is still a puppet right? A ventriloquist's puppet!\nTrilo:\nHey! Who do you think you are, calling me a puppet!?\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nBen:\nUmm... Uhh... Thanks...

Money?\nAfter presenting Trilo Quist, then clearing all Talk options in Big Top - Cafeteria:\nDecember 28Lodging HousePlaza\nMaya:\nHuh? Detective Gumshoe took off already.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... Probably because we ditched him earlier. (Changed from [Yep. Just leave him alone for a while, OK Maya?] in the original release) I bet he and the other cops got lonely and headed back to the precinct. (Changed from [I'm sure he just got lonely and headed back to the precinct.] in the original release)\nDecember 28Lodging Hall 1st FloorMoe's Room\nMoe:\nOh my! If it isn't \"Mr. Wright All The Time\"!!\nPhoenix:\n*ugh*\nMoe:\nIt's all Wright to be wrong every now and again, Wright?\nMaya:\nSee Nick! It just took awhile for the joke to find its audience!\nPhoenix:\n... *sigh*\nMoe:\nSo what can I do for you? Did you remember a good joke you wanted to tell me? Pull up a chair, or maybe just pull my finger, and let me have it.\nMaya:\nWe're going to get the same sound effect either way, aren't we?\nMoe:\nHow'd you know I put a whopee [sic] cushion on the chair!? You really know what it takes to be a clown, don't you? Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!

It seems like he's not around today...\nMaya:\nEh... That's a big pile of junk over in the corner...\nMoe:\nI don't think it'd be wrong to assume that Phoenix's stuff is over there too... Just be careful to make sure you've got the Wright stuff.\nMaya:\nThanks Moe! See you later!\nMoney has been added to the Court Record.\nAcro's Room\nMaya:\nHoly cow! There's a fork...

Check this out.\nMaya:\nIt's a ring...\nPhoenix:\nThere's something engraved on it... \"From T to R\"...\nRing put in pocket.\nPhoenix:\nWell... I think it's about time we wrap up our investigation...\nMaya:\nDo you think we'll win in court tomorrow?\nPhoenix:\nWho knows... Even I can't imagine what kind of testimony will come out tomorrow. (I'm guessing Moe will be a witness in court tomorrow... Moe and maybe the puppet.)\nMaya:\nDon't worry Nick. No matter what, we've still got a magician on our side!!\nPhoenix:\nThat's good, because we might need some magic tomorrow...\nTo be continued.\nMoe's Room (before examining junk pile in Lodging Hall 3rd Floor - Acro's Room)\nMaya:\nHuh? Moe must have gone off somewhere...\nPhoenix:\nJust as long as he isn't off writing new jokes...\nMaya:\nOh, that reminds me Nick... You have to get your Attorney's Badge back by tomorrow, or we're in trouble.\nPhoenix:\nI know. I know. (I'm gonna have to try and find out where that monkey hid it...)"

You can't imagine how much I've suffered...\nYou... suffered?\nAnd now... the perfect opportunity presents itself. At last... I shall have my revenge!\nWhat!?\n...Merry Christmas.\nDecember 25, 10:08 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nMaya:\nHey, hey, Nick! Do you know if there's any good waterfalls around here?\nPhoenix:\nWaterfalls...? Dare I ask why?\nMaya:\nDuh, Nick! Isn't it obvious? I need a waterfall to stand under! Preferably a freezing one!\nPhoenix:\n... Oh... Is that part of your spirit medium training?\nMaya:\nOf course! Except, I've been slacking off lately... I need to brave the elements and be forged anew under the rushing spring waters!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Okay... I don't know about any falls per se, but Gourd Lake is pretty close...\nMaya:\nOh. Darn.\nPhoenix:\nSorry, but them's the breaks. Couldn't you just take a cold shower or something?\nMaya:\n... Good idea!\nPhoenix:\n(So much for the rushing spring waters...)\nTV:\nNext in the news... A large, unidentified animal was sighted at Gourd Lake! The town is buzzing with excitement! Locals are calling it \"Gourdy\" in a tip of the hat to Nessie, the Loch Ness monster. Though its namesake, Nessie, proved to be a hoax... locals are confident their Gourdy is the real deal. ...\nPhoenix:\n*yawn* Bor-ing. Can't they show real news for a change?\nMaya:\nNick?\nPhoenix:\n?\nMaya:\nThe water pressure's kind of low in that shower.\nPhoenix:\n... You want more pressure, huh? Why don't you go down to the fire department and have them spray you with the hose?\nMaya:\n... Good idea, Nick!\nPhoenix:\n(Apparently, Fey blood is no aid in detecting sarcasm...) (Changed from [Apparently, E.S.P. is no aid in detecting sarcasm...] in the original release)\nTV:\nWe interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin! Strange occurrences continue at Gourd Lake... But this time, it's murder!\nPhoenix:\n(Gourd Lake again?)\nTV:\nThe body of a man was found in the lake early this morning. A suspect was apprehended. Sources inside the police department revealed... that the suspect's name is Miles Edgeworth, age 24. Edgeworth was an up-and-coming prosecution attorney, known for his skill and connections. He was guaranteed a long and rewarding career... Has he thrown it all away?\nPhoenix:\n(...? E-Edgeworth!?) What's going on!? Edgeworth would never do something like--\nMaya:\nNick?\nPhoenix:\nYipes! M-Maya!\nMaya:\nThe fireman yelled at me when I called him.\nPhoenix:\nWe've got bigger things to worry about than that! They arrested Edgeworth!\nMaya:\nWhat? You mean, the prosecutor?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, he's a suspect... in a murder!\nMaya:\nWhaaaaat!? When? Where? Whom? Why? How?\nPhoenix:\nI-I don't know!\nMaya:\nLet's go find out, Nick!\nDecember 25Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nMaya:\nYou know, Nick... We've all been in here one time or another, haven't we?\nPhoenix:\nI guess it comes with the territory.\nMaya:\nI'm not sure it's something we should mention to too many people... Aah!\nPhoenix:\n... Hey! Edgeworth! Come back!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat are you doing here!?\nMaya:\nNick, I don't think he's in a very good mood.\nPhoenix:\nWell, he is in detention. Were you in a good mood when you were here?\nEdgeworth:\nSo, you've come to laugh at the fallen attorney? Then laugh, laugh! Well? Why aren't you laughing?\nMaya:\nNick... Should we be laughing?\nPhoenix:\nNah. It's a trick. Laugh and he'll get mad... or burst into tears. Edgeworth. We don't have so much free time we can spend it coming down here to laugh at you.\nEdgeworth:\n... Yes you do.\nPhoenix:\n(Actually, he's right.)\nEdgeworth:\n... I hoped you wouldn't come. I didn't want you to see me. Not like this.\nPhoenix:\n(I didn't want to see you like this, either. Believe me.) (Changed from [Hey, I didn't want to see you either, believe me.] in the original release)\nDecember 25Gourd Lake ParkEntrance\nMaya:\nThis is where it happened?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. Gourd Lake is in the middle of this park.\nMaya:\nI can see some police walking around in there.\nPhoenix:\nQuestioning people, probably.\nMaya:\nHey! Isn't that Detective Gumshoe over there?\nGumshoe:\nWell, pal!? There's enough of us here! Anyone found anything?\nPolice:\nS-sorry, sir... Nothing.\nGumshoe:\nIdiot! The trial's tomorrow! We need clues, on the double!\nPolice:\nB-but, sir... There weren't any clues... that's why we arrested that attorney, Mr. Edgeworth! It's clear, sir. He's the one who--\nGumshoe:\nShaddup! Just you try saying that again! I'll... I'll... I'll make you sorry if you do! (Changed from [I'll... er... I'll make you sorry if you do!] in the original release) So just... just, get outta my face, pal! (Changed from [I mean... just, get outta my face, pal!] in the original release)\nPolice:\nY-yes, sir!\nMaya:\nDetective Gumshoe's kinda scary today!\nGumshoe:\nRecruits... peh! ... Aah!\nMaya:\nEek!\nGumshoe:\nHey, you're that Harry guy! Harry Butz!\nPhoenix:\nWright! Phoenix Wright! (Will he ever learn my name!?)\nGumshoe:\nAnd just what are you doing here, pal? Investigating!?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Um, well, yes. I suppose.\nGumshoe:\nWell, I'm here to help! Ask me anything you want! Bring it!\nMaya:\nHe seems different than usual. I wonder what's up? Umm... Mr. Edgeworth hasn't actually asked us to defend him yet...\nGumshoe:\nHuh!? Oh? Y-you don't say...\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPolice:\nDetective Gumshoe, sir!\nGumshoe:\nWhat? Find something!?\nPolice:\nUm, no, sir. Not yet. But there was a call from the precinct. They want to hold an investigation briefing...\nGumshoe:\nA briefing? Right! I'm off! Oh... Sorry, pal. I guess you heard. I gotta go. Any last things you want to ask me about before I head back?\nPhoenix:\nYou're not coming back, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nErm... Probably not, pal.\nPhoenix:\nSo, what should we do if we have something to talk to you about...?\nGumshoe:\nAh, right. Here, I'll show you how to get to the precinct. Come down and see me anytime.\nDetective Gumshoe gave you directions to the police station.\nPhoenix:\nOh, hey! Detective Gumshoe!\nGumshoe:\nW-what!?\nPhoenix:\nUm, we'd like to take a look around in the park. Can we walk around?\nGumshoe:\nYeah! No problem, pal. You got my permission.\nMaya:\nYou know, Nick. I think there's something to be said for talking to people when they're busy.\nPhoenix:\nYeah. They don't have time to think about not giving you information...\nMaya:\nRight! Now, let's get investigating!\nDecember 25Police DepartmentCriminal Affairs\nMaya:\n... Looks like Detective Gumshoe isn't here.\nChief:\nSomething wrong, miss? Hmm? Turning yourself in? Okay, what did you do? Shoplifting? Larceny? Public indecency...?\nMaya:\nN-no! None of those things! We're looking for Detective Gumshoe... is he around?\nChief:\nGumshoe? Oh yeah. He's in a meeting right now. I don't think he'll be out any time soon.\nMaya:\nOkay, we'll come back.\nChief:\nYou do that. Oh, and go straight home and stay out of trouble. No more shoplifting, you got that?\nMaya:\n... Do I look like a criminal or something?\nDecember 25Gourd LakePublic Beach\nMaya:\nWowsers! This is \"Gourd Lake\"?\nPhoenix:\nYup. I'm not sure it warrants a \"wowsers,\" though.\nMaya:\nHmm. Probably not. But hey, look at that snack stand!\nPhoenix:\n\"Samurai Dogs\"...?\nMaya:\nI wanna Samurai Dog! Please! I bet they're great!\nPhoenix:\nWith a name like Samurai Dog, how could they not be?\nMaya:\nThey're a little behind the times, though. The kids are all into \"The Pink Princess\" now. I mean, like, y'know!?\nPhoenix:\n(Nope.)\nWright & Co. Law Offices\nDetention Center\nDecember 25Boat Rental Shop\nMaya:\nNick... what is this place?\nPhoenix:\nA boat rental shop. Closed for Christmas it seems. I guess a murder taking place on one of the boats won't be good for business, either.\nMaya:\nBoats... I've never ridden on a boat.\nPhoenix:\nReally? Well, how about we go out on one when the trial is finished?\nMaya:\nHey, good idea! You bet!\nDecember 25Gourd Lake Woods\nMaya:\nI like it here, Nick. Look... someone's camping!\nPhoenix:\nThey've got guts, camping at the scene of a murder.\nMaya:\nHey, hey, Nick! If they were camping here last night, they might know about the murder!\nPhoenix:\n(That's true...) Good call, Maya. Let's go talk to them.\nPhoenix:\nThis camera has a mic and some sort of attachment. It must take pictures when triggered by a noise.\nMaya:\nWow! Cool! Let's try it out! *cough* \"Hi, I'm Nick!\" ... Maybe I'm not saying it loud enough. \"HEY! I'M NICK!!!\" ... Huh. NIIIIIIIIII......IIIIIIIIIICK!\nPhoenix:\nWill you stop that?\nMaya:\nMaybe it's broken?\nPhoenix:\nD-don't kick it! Maybe it isn't set up to respond to voices?\nMaya:\nWell what then? These things?

Y'all know how much a roll of that film costs!?\nMaya:\nI-I'll pay you back!\n???:\nWhat were ya'll thinkin' settin' off a party-popper in a place like this?\nMaya:\nUh... well...\n???:\nWhat! Don't try to play stupid with me just 'cause you think I'm some country bumpkin! Yeah, I know how y'all Yanks think! \"I say, those southern folks talk with that exaggerated drawl, why they must be dumb!\" Well let me tell you, just because I might be dumb don't mean we all are!\nMaya:\nN-Nick, help!\n???:\nAnd who are you, now? Her chaperone?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, uh, no, rather, uhh... we're sort of... friends?\n???:\nJus' figure out what y'all are gonna say and say it for bejeezum's sake! Gawd, I'd rather sit through one of papa's drawls than listen to you stutter all day.\nPhoenix:\n(Oh boy... I guess we should pay her for the film...)\n???:\nWatch it!\nPhoenix:\nYes ma'am. (On second thought, I'll pay later...)\nMaya:\nI'm really sorry!\nPhoenix:\nI, er, this is my badge.\n???:\nHuh? Aren't badges supposed t' be all shiny and impressive? You a cop or something?\nPhoenix:\nUmm... I'm a lawyer.\n???:\nWh-what!? Y'all ain't gonna try and pull one o' them lawsuits on me over that film now? Cause I'll have you know I'm a fighter and I wrassled meaner looking' things'n you!\nPhoenix:\nN-no, that's not it at all. We're here investigating a murder that took place here, on the lake.\n???:\nA murder...? ... Sounds cool! Why didn't y'all say that in the first place! Go ahead, ask me anything ya like!\nPhoenix:\n(Finally! Some cooperation!)\n???:\nYou too. Y'all can come out of hiding now. I won't bite. Hard.\nPhoenix:\n(Come to think of it, where did Maya get to?)\nMaya:\nS-sorry... I-I was feeling a little overwhelmed. The culture gap and all...\n???:\nNever you mind, honey. I kin' talk Yank for ya if... ahem... if it pleases you?\nMaya:\nTh-thanks. I think I'll be okay.\nLotta:\nGreat then! I'm Lotta, Lotta Hart, but y'all can call me Lotta! I'm here photographing meteor showers for a research project. Mighty pleased ta meet ya!\nPhoenix:\nLotta?\nLotta:\nYeah?\nPhoenix:\nSo, your camera... it triggers on loud explosion noises?\nLotta:\nAyup.\nPhoenix:\nActually, the victim in the case we're researching--he was shot with a pistol.\nLotta:\nA pistol...?\nPhoenix:\nRight. Now wouldn't a gunshot make a similar noise to our party popper...?\nLotta:\nI guess it would.\nPhoenix:\nYour camera... didn't get a picture of the murder, did it?\nLotta:\n... Hey! Y'all are pretty bright!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nLotta:\nI see what yer sayin'... Tell ya what, I'll have a look-see at my film.\nPhoenix:\nIt would have been a photo taken late last night...\nLotta:\nI checked 'em once, don't remember if there was anything on 'em though. But what if I got sumtin'! I could be witness to a genuine murder! Yeehaw! I'll go check that film. Y'all come back now, y'hear?\nMaya:\nShe went inside her SUV. I guess we should come back later...\nWright & Co. Law Offices\nAfter presenting Lotta's Camera in Gourd Lake Woods:\nDecember 25Police DepartmentCriminal Affairs\nMaya:\n... I guess Detective Gumshoe is still in that meeting.\nGumshoe:\nHey! Thanks for coming down, pal!\nMaya:\nDetective Gumshoe!\nGumshoe:\nWe just finished the meeting. For better or for worse...\nPhoenix:\n(I get the feeling we're in for some bad news...)\nWright & Co. Law Offices (after clearing \"The autopsy report\" Talk option in Police Department - Criminal Affairs)\nMaya:\n...\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it?\nMaya:\nOh. Nothing... Just, something's been bothering me. ... Could you show me that autopsy report once more? ... ... ... Hey! I-I remember now! This guy! This is a lawyer that was at that office Mia worked at! I met him once when I went there to hang out with Sis!\nPhoenix:\nThat office...? Wait! You mean Grossberg's office?\nMaya:\nRight! That guy!\nPhoenix:\n(That was the last name I expected to come up... Maybe I should go talk to him... for old time's sake.)\nDecember 25Grossberg Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nIt's been a while since I was here last. Mr. Grossberg is out as usual.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick. Look at the wall.\nPhoenix:\n(That painting is still missing... Mia must have known about the deal with Mr. Grossberg and Redd White... She kept track of all of White's extortion and blackmail rackets.)\nDetention Center\nAfter clearing \"The autopsy report\" Talk option in Police Department - Criminal Affairs:\nDecember 25Gourd Lake Woods\nLotta:\nHey y'all!\nMaya:\nLotta!\nLotta:\nWait up a sec! We got bingo!\nMaya:\nBingo...?\nLotta:\nMy automatic camera took two pictures last night!\nMaya:\nHey!\nLotta:\nThis is them. Take a look!\nPhoenix:\nWait...!\nLotta:\nSee? See? He's shooting him with that pistol!\nPhoenix:\nI-it looks like that, yes.\nMaya:\nBut you can't really tell who that is shooting.\nLotta:\nYeah, well there was enough fog out there last night t' strangle a bullfrog. But, y'know... Seeing these photos reminded me of something.\nMaya:\nWhat...?\nLotta:\nI saw the murder happen. I'm a witness!\nMaya:\nWhaaaaaaa!?\nPhoenix:\nA-are you serious!?\nLotta:\nCourse!\nPhoenix:\n(How do you forget... never mind.)\nLotta:\nY'all reckon I should tell the cops?\nLotta:\nHey, so, I'm off to talk to the cops. Y'all can have this photo. Later.\nPhoenix:\nW-w-wait! Lotta!\nLotta:\nWhat? Can't y'all see I'm kinda busy?\nPhoenix:\nT-tell us what you saw, too! Please?\nLotta:\nNice try, honey, but I wasn't born yesterday. I'm a witness, and that means I'm on the side of justice, and that means the cops! I'd sooner eat the south side of a north-bound skunk than tell you!\nMaya:\nL-Lotta!\nLotta:\nDon't let it get your skivvies in a bunch. Friends today, enemies tomorrow! Or was that the other way round? No matter. I'm gone! Hey! Maybe they'll let me do some testifying! Hot darn!\nMaya:\nShe left... ... Well, that's one more witness. What do we do now, Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Well, if she saw something, there's not much we can do about it. The question is: what exactly did she see...? I guess we'll find out in the trial tomorrow.)\nLake Photo added to the Court Record.\nDecember 25Gourd LakePublic Beach\nMaya:\nLooks like the police have given up their interviewing.

I see the connection!\nPhoenix:\nDon't be ridiculous!\n???:\nDude, it's me!\nPhoenix:\nL... Larry! What are you doing here!?\nButz:\nIsn't it obvious? I'm working my day job! I sell Samurai Dogs! Want one? Gotta get money for dates, you know, My girl Kiyance deserves the best!\nPhoenix:\n(K-Kiyance...? Not another model, I hope...)\nButz:\nOh, Kiyance's a fine, fine woman, Nick. It was her idea that I wear this costume! She was all \"You go girlfriend!\" Y'know? She bought this costume for me!\nPhoenix:\nThat... that's great, Larry.\nMaya:\nWow! A Santa costume! She must be really nice!\nButz:\nWhoa! Cute! Nick! Who's she? She's not your...?\nPhoenix:\nNot my... what? N-no, she's not!\nMaya:\nI'm his partner, Maya Fey. I'm, uh, the little sister.\nButz:\nSister...? ... Wow, Nick, must be tough. Working nine to five, having to take care of a little sister...\nMaya:\nN-no, I'm not Nick's sister, I'm my older sister's little sister...\nButz:\nHuh. Sounds great!\nPhoenix:\n(Don't worry, Maya, he's not listening...)\nDecember 25Police DepartmentCriminal Affairs\nMaya:\n... Not a Gumshoe in sight.\nPolice:\nIf you're looking for Detective Gumshoe, he's in the questioning room. Apparently, an important witness turned up.

I guess you don't really need to know.\nEdgeworth:\nHuh... My letter of request. Please give it to Detective Gumshoe.\nEdgeworth's Request put in pocket.\nPhoenix:\nWell, I guess we should... ... W-what's that!?\nMaya:\nE-earthquake! Nick! It's a big one! Whaaaaa! I-it's calming down... ... Whew... that was scary!\nPhoenix:\n...? Huh? Where's Edgeworth?\nMaya:\n... There. He's on the floor in a ball, shivering. I guess he doesn't do so well with earthquakes.\nPhoenix:\n(I've heard of running, but curling up in a ball?)\nMaya:\nWell, I guess we're done. Mr. Edgeworth doesn't seem like he's going to stand up any time soon. Let's go, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nUh.. right. We have to give Edgeworth's letter of request to Detective Gumshoe.\nAfter Edgeworth's Request is added to the Court Record:\nDecember 25Police DepartmentCriminal Affairs\nGumshoe:\nWhat's going on here!?\nMaya:\nEek!\nPhoenix:\nW-what's wrong, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nThis wild lady comes in here just a while ago... Says she came \"to talk to y'all after hearing what Mr. Wright had to say\"! What's this all about, pal!?\nPhoenix:\n(Lotta Hart...)\nGumshoe:\nWhy are you going around finding more witnesses!? You want to give Mr. Edgeworth the death sentence, pal!?\nPhoenix:\nN-no, not at all... Just... I mean, she did see something. There's nothing I can do about that. I can't go around covering up evidence!\nGumshoe:\nEr... You trying to say something about the way I do my job?\nPhoenix:\nNo sir!\nPhoenix:\nLook what I got.\nGumshoe:\n... Hey, you did it, pal! Glad I waited till the last minute to file those papers! I'll rip 'em up and start new ones for you!\nPhoenix:\nThanks, Detective. Well, see you in court tomorrow, then.\nGumshoe:\nGood luck, pal. Hey! You guys feel that earthquake a little while back? I was worried!\nMaya:\nWorried? We're fine! I've lived out here my whole life. I'm pretty used to them by now.\nGumshoe:\nOh, I wasn't worried about you two. I was worried about Mr. Edgeworth!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, right...) He did seem to over-react a little, now that you mention it.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, well, I'm not surprised. It was a pretty big quake. I'm going to go check on him. You two go eat and get your rest for tomorrow's trial. Later!\nMaya:\n... I wonder what it is with Mr. Edgeworth and earthquakes?\nPhoenix:\nI wonder... He was never that scared of them when he was in school.\nPhoenix:\n(Then again, I only really got to know him in 4th grade. (Changed from [Then again, I was only in the same class as him for 4th grade.] in the original release) He transferred to another school after that. I wonder what happened to Edgeworth...)\nTo be continued.\n\nDecember 26, 9:44 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2\nPhoenix:\nKarma...? (ellipsis and question mark highlighted in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\nThat's right, Manfred von Karma. He's the best prosecutor there is. He hasn't lost a case in his 40-year career. He is a god of prosecution, Wright! A god!\nMaya:\nNot a single case?\nEdgeworth:\nHe'll do anything to get a guilty verdict, anything.\nPhoenix:\nHmm. Sounds like someone else I know, Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. You don't understand. I mean he'll really do anything. Manfred von Karma is a man to be feared.\nPhoenix:\n(That's quite a claim coming from someone who forges evidence...)\nEdgeworth:\nHe taught me what it really means to \"prosecute.\"\nPhoenix:\nWh-what!?\nEdgeworth:\nJust picture a prosecutor as vicious as me... multiplied by a factor of ten.\nMaya:\nUgh... So... so was he your teacher, then, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nSomething like that...\nMaya:\nAnd now he's trying to get you found guilty!? What a creep! Oh, wait... Maybe he's planning on losing on purpose to help you out.\nEdgeworth:\nNot a chance... He hasn't lost once in 40 years. 40 years! He's as ruthless as me, times twenty!\nMaya:\nThat's pretty ruthless...\nEdgeworth:\nLike I said. He's a god among prosecutors.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess that's something like Mia was to me. Speaking of Mia...) Um, Maya?\nMaya:\nUh huh?\nPhoenix:\nWe could really be using Mia's help right now... don't you think?\nMaya:\nOh...\nPhoenix:\n?\nMaya:\nI can't. Sorry. I tried, I really tried, but I couldn't reach.\nPhoenix:\nYou couldn't \"reach\"?\nMaya:\nI think it's because I haven't been training. My powers are weak again...\nPhoenix:\nOh man, what bad timing!\nMaya:\nI'm really sorry. I'll try my best!\nPhoenix:\nI hope so!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat are you whispering about?\nPhoenix:\nO-oh, it's nothing. Well, it's time. Let's head in...\nDecember 26, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3\nJudge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Miles Edgeworth.\nPhoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.\nKarma:\n...\nJudge:\nErr, Mr. von Karma? Is the prosecution ready?\nKarma:\n... Fool... You seriously think that I would stand here were I not completely prepared?\nJudge:\nR-right, my apologies!\nPhoenix:\n(He's even got the Judge scared!)\nJudge:\nVery well, your opening statement, please.\nKarma:\n... Decisive evidence... A decisive witness... What else could possibly be required?\nJudge:\nAh... er, nothing of course. That should be fine. The prosecution may call its first witness.\nMaya:\nWhat's with this guy? Is he royalty or something?\nPhoenix:\nHow am I supposed to fight against this!?\nKarma:\nI call the detective in charge of this case, Detective Dick Gumshoe.\nPhoenix:\n(Okay, Gumshoe's first... Let's see how this goes.)\nKarma:\nDescribe the incident. Now!\nGumshoe:\nY-yessir!\nPhoenix:\n(Detective Gumshoe looks nervous...)\nGumshoe:\nEr, please take a look at the map. The murder happened late Christmas Eve, around midnight. There was one boat in the very middle of the lake. There were two men on the boat. Now, there happened to be a woman camping here on the edge of the lake. At 12:10 AM, she heard two pistol shots. Then the boat started to move. It went towards the boat rental shop.\nKarma:\nHmm.\nOverhead Map added to the Court Record.\nKarma:\nTestify to the court about your arrest. Now!\nJudge:\nW-w-wait! Mr. von Karma...\nKarma:\nYes?\nJudge:\nActually, I'm the one that's supposed to be handling these proceedings...\nKarma:\nWrong. There is only one thing you need to do here. You will slam down your gavel and say the word \"guilty.\" That is your role!\nJudge:\nY-yes, of course. You're quite right.\nPhoenix:\n(No, he's not!!!)\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Arrest of Edgeworth --\nGumshoe:\nA man called into the station around 30 minutes after midnight.\nWe headed to the scene of the crime as fast as we could.\nThat's where we found Mr. Edgeworth.\nNow, I didn't suspect him of anything at all.\nBut... the next morning, a body was found in the lake.\nSo we had to arrest Mr. Edgeworth.\nJudge:\nHmm... I see. Very well...\nKarma:\nBegin your cross-examination, attorney. Now!\nJudge:\n...\nCross Examination\n-- The Arrest of Edgeworth --\nGumshoe:\nA man called into the station around 30 minutes after midnight.\nGumshoe:\nWe headed to the scene of the crime as fast as we could.\nGumshoe:\nThat's where we found Mr. Edgeworth.\nGumshoe:\nNow, I didn't suspect him of anything at all.\nGumshoe:\nBut... the next morning, a body was found in the lake.\nGumshoe:\nSo we had to arrest Mr. Edgeworth.\nGumshoe:\nThe murder weapon we found in the boat was decisive evidence.\nMaya:\nNick. Doesn't it seem like Detective Gumshoe is being a little vague?\nPhoenix:\nI bet von Karma is feeding him lines! His testimony's probably filled with landmines just waiting for me to press.\nMaya:\nWhat do we do?\nPhoenix:\nGrit our teeth and press, I guess. What else can we do?\nMaya:\nWell said, Nick! You're the man!\nAfter pressing fifth statement and pressing modified sixth statement:\nKarma:\nMembers of the court... We now have the pistol used in the murder, and the bullet found in the body! Detective!\nGumshoe:\nY-y-yessir!\nKarma:\nWas the bullet found in the body fired from this pistol?\nGumshoe:\nYes. The ballistic markings on the bullet match the pistol.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! What does he mean, \"ballistic markings\"?\nKarma:\nShocking! To imagine someone here does not know something as basic as ballistic markings!\nMaya:\nN-Nick! He's glaring at me!\nKarma:\nTsk... very well, I'll explain. Actually, Judge! You do it.\nJudge:\nEh? M-me? ... Erm, ahem. Ballistic markings are like the \"fingerprints\" of a gun. The barrel leaves distinctive marks on each bullet it fires. You can examine these \"ballistic fingerprints\" to see which gun fired the shot. It's quite accurate.\nKarma:\nIndeed. This leads to one, inevitable conclusion: the bullet found in the victim's heart... was, without a doubt, fired from this pistol. This pistol which, as you may recall, was covered with the defendant's own fingerprints!\nJudge:\nO-order! Order!\nPhoenix:\n(This is bad... This makes it look like Edgeworth did it!)\nKarma:\nWell, Judge?\nJudge:\nI'd say it's almost decisive, yes. Honestly, I could declare a verdict at this point. However...\nKarma:\nYou wish to hear the witness speak, no doubt. Very well. I am somewhat fatigued, and so I will take a brief break. I will call my witness after the recess. Which will last ten minutes. Judge!\nJudge:\nY-yes?\nKarma:\nWhat are you doing? A ten minute recess! Now!\nJudge:\nB-but, wait, I...\nKarma:\nJust bang your flimsy gavel and get on with it, man!\nJudge:\nY-yes! Ahem. This court will take a ten minute recess.\nPhoenix:\n(Who's running this court, anyway!?)\nDecember 26, 11:09 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth! What's going on here!? Your fingerprints were on the murder weapon!\nEdgeworth:\nUh... hmm...\nPhoenix:\nAnd that foggy photo makes one thing clear... The only one who could have shot that man was the person in the photo!\nEdgeworth:\nTrue...\nPhoenix:\nWas that you in the boat?\nEdgeworth:\n... Yes. It was me.\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nEdgeworth:\nBut... you must believe me. I didn't shoot him.\nPhoenix:\nTh-then who did!?\nEdgeworth:\nI... don't know.\nPhoenix:\nYou don't know!? Weren't you right there!?\nEdgeworth:\n... I heard a gunshot from very close by. Then... the other man fell from the boat. I can't say why, but... I thought, at the time, that he had shot himself!\nPhoenix:\nY-you mean it was a suicide!?\nEdgeworth:\n... That's the only explanation I can come up with.\nPhoenix:\nHuh... (How am I going to convince anyone of that!?) Say, Maya?\nMaya:\nHuh? Wh-what?\nPhoenix:\nAny progress with Mia?\nMaya:\nOh... Sorry. It's no good.\nPhoenix:\nUgh...\nMaya:\nI know... I'm no good for anything, am I, Nick? If I can't call my sister, I might as well not be here, right?\nMaya:\nI don't know anything about trials, or defense... What's more, I'm a spirit medium who can't even contact spirits...\nPhoenix:\nAww, everyone has their off days! I mean, I've just been getting lucky lately... But you never know when my luck is going to run out!\nMaya:\nReally...?\nEdgeworth:\nW-w-whoa! Wright! Don't jinx this case any worse than it already is! It's bad for my heart...\nPhoenix:\nOh? Oh! S-sorry... (Whoops!)\nJudge:\nCourt is back in session. Mr. von Karma, call your witness.\nKarma:\nYes. Will Ms. Lotta Hart take the stand?\nKarma:\nLotta Hart, you are a research student at a university?\nLotta:\nThat I am.\nKarma:\nGood. Begin by telling us what you saw the night of the incident. And don't add anything trivial or subjective. Understand?\nLotta:\n... Y'all need to learn some manners.\nKarma:\nUNDERSTAND?\nLotta:\nY-yeah, I understand, I understand!\nJudge:\nEr... very well. Your testimony, please.\nWitness Testimony\n-- Witness's Account --\nLotta:\nIt was Christmas Eve, just after midnight, I reckon.\nI was in my car.\nI heard this \"bang\" come up from the lake.\nWhen I looked out the window, I saw two gents in a boat.\nThen there was another \"bang\"...\nThere wasn't nary a thing on the lake but that boat.\nKarma:\nEnough.\nLotta:\nHuh?\nKarma:\nJudge! She happened to take a photo of the incident! This is that photo. Accept it as evidence.\nJudge:\nW-well! This is a surprise! This looks like... the very moment of the murder! O-Order! I will remove you from the court if I do not have order immediately!\nKarma:\nAs the witness testified, she looked at the lake when she heard the shot. There were no other boats on that lake! So, the man in the boat with the victim must have been the one who shot him... Yes. It was the defendant, Miles Edgeworth!!!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order...! I will have order!\nKarma:\n... Well, Judge?\nJudge:\nThe evidence is... decisive. I have very little doubt about this case. Very well, this court finds the defendant...\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nW-wait! Your Honor! I haven't cross-examined the witness yet!\nKarma:\nA cross-examination? We have photographic proof! What question can there possibly be!? This photo is worth a thousand words... and they all read \"guilty\"! You lose. Or... Do you claim to have found a contradiction in her testimony!?\nPhoenix:\n...!\nKarma:\nVery well. If you have to, you may cross-examine the witness. You will only flounder and ask meaningless questions! You will fail to find anything! And then, I will have you held in contempt of court!\nMaya:\nUh, Nick... contempt...?\nPhoenix:\n\"Contempt of court,\" you know?\nMaya:\nI... guess I understand. Well... what are you going to do? Do you really think there was a contradiction with the facts in her testimony?\nPhoenix:\nI understand... I will cross-examine the witness!\nKarma:\nTsk tsk tsk... Very well!\nJudge:\nI pray for your sake this isn't a waste of time.\nCross Examination\n-- Witness's Account --\nLotta:\nIt was Christmas Eve, just after midnight, I reckon.\nLotta:\nI was in my car.\nLotta:\nI heard this \"bang\" come up from the lake.\nLotta:\nWhen I looked out the window, I saw two gents in a boat.\nLotta:\nThen there was another \"bang\"...\nLotta:\nThere wasn't nary a thing on the lake but that boat.\nPhoenix:\n(Th-there weren't any contradictions in there!)\nMaya:\nSorry, Nick. If only my sister were here...\nPhoenix:\n(Maya's really taking this hard.)\nAfter selecting \"Press further\" upon pressing second, fourth, and sixth statements, and pressing fifth statement:\nJudge:\nEnough! I think we've heard all we need to hear, Mr. Wright. It seems you are unable to find a contradiction in the testimony worth noting.\nPhoenix:\nB-but, Your Honor!\nKarma:\nYou keep your promise!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. I am afraid that I will have to penalize any further outbursts... By holding you in contempt of court!\nKarma:\nAnd if that happens, you'll have to leave the courtroom immediately! Understood...?\nPhoenix:\nUh... uh huh.\nMaya:\nNick...! Lotta's testimony is fishy, Nick! Real fishy!\nPhoenix:\nI... know what you mean. But... If I can't say anything, what can I do?\nJudge:\nI believe we've covered the evidence sufficiently to make a decision.\nKarma:\nThen, pass your judgment!\nJudge:\nVery well. Mr. Miles Edgeworth, please take the stand.\n???:\nJudge:\nWh-who was that!?\nMaya:\nIt... was me.\nPhoenix:\n(Maya!)\nJudge:\nI-is something wrong? D-do you need to use the facilities?\nMaya:\nNo, I do not! Lotta Hart! Your testimony stinks! It's unclear whether you were actually looking at the lake! It's highly doubtful that you actually say Mr. Edgeworth! Tell us the truth! This is a matter of life or death!\nLotta:\n...!\nMaya:\nLotta! Did you really clearly see Mr. Edgeworth that night!? Did you see him fire that pistol!?\nJudge:\nYou will stand down! The court does not acknowledge the defense's outburst!\nMaya:\nAnswer me, Lotta!\nLotta:\nWhat's the big idea, treating me like some kind of criminal!? I saw him! I swear it! I saw Edgeworth...\nKarma:\nKarma:\nEnough! Judge... Declare the defense in contempt of court!\nJudge:\nY-yes... yes, of course. I'm sorry, but you WERE warned. Guard! Escort Mr. Wright out of the courtroom! He is in contempt of court, and must leave.\nPhoenix:\n(No... No...!)\nWait!\nMaya:\nI-I was the one who made the outburst, Your Honor! Nick is innocent!\nKarma:\nHah! What's the difference? All that remains is for the guilty verdict to be declared! Isn't that right, Mr. Phoenix Wright!?\nPhoenix:\nDid you hear what Ms. Hart just said? She said she clearly saw Mr. Edgeworth! That was not in the testimony! That changes her testimony, and I have a right to cross-examine her again!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order! Order! Order! Order!\nKarma:\nYou're in contempt of court! It's too late for wild claims! Judge! Sustain my objection!\nJudge:\n... ... I'm sorry, Mr. von Karma, but I cannot.\nKarma:\nWhat!?\nJudge:\nMs. Lotta Hart has made a new testimony. The defense does have a right to cross-examine her again.\nKarma:\nB-but he is in contempt of court!\nMaya:\nNo, I am! If you're going to arrest someone, arrest me!\nJudge:\nHmm... Very well. Maya Fey! You will leave the courtroom immediately.\nMaya:\nNick! I did what I could... You have to do the rest! Good luck!\nPhoenix:\nM-Maya...!\nKarma:\nPeh! I care not for this melodrama! Listen well, Mr. Wright! I do not tolerate badgering of my witnesses!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm running out of time... I'd better find a contradiction in here or else...)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Begin your cross-examination!\nCross Examination\n-- That Last Statement --\nLotta:\nI saw it clear as day. The man on the boat was Mr. Edgeworth!\nPhoenix:\n(That's it...? Uh oh. I don't know if I can find anything in that... What will Maya say...?)\nPhoenix:\nGot you. Got you, Ms. Hart! Finally!\nLotta:\nWh-what!? You got what?\nPhoenix:\nLook at this photograph.\nLotta:\nThe photo I took...?\nPhoenix:\nThe very same. There's something I want you to see in this photo... it's quite clearly visible. The fog, Ms. Hart.\nLotta:\nSo... so?\nPhoenix:\nThis picture was taken with professional, high quality film, correct? Yet even it could not capture the faces of the men on the boat! Yet you claim you saw Mr. Edgeworth! How!?\nLotta:\nWhut!? Wha--!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright has a point!\nKarma:\nKarma:\nThat's why I told her not to say that in her testimony! Please!\nPhoenix:\nYet, now she has said it, Mr. von Karma. How could you possibly see Mr. Edgeworth!? Explain yourself!\nJudge:\nMs. Hart.\nLotta:\nWhat!\nJudge:\nCould you see the defendant that night?\nLotta:\nO-of course! I said I could and I meant I could!\nJudge:\nThen, please testify as to the circumstances of your sighting.\nPhoenix:\n(I did it! I finally found a hole in von Karma's carefully vague testimony!)\nWitness Testimony\n-- How Edgeworth Was Seen --\nLotta:\nYer right. It was a cold night, and the fog was thick as grits.\nSo, once I was finished setting up my camera, I got back in the car.\nStill, I brought my binoculars with me.\nWhen I heard that noise out on the lake, I looked with my binoculars.\nSee? No problem!\nJudge:\nHmm...You used binoculars? Very well. You may begin your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(This one'd better be good!)\nCross Examination\n-- How Edgeworth Was Seen --\nLotta:\nYer right. It was a cold night, and the mist was thick as grits.\nLotta:\nSo, once I was finished setting up my camera, I got back in the car.\nLotta:\nStill, I brought my binoculars with me.\nLotta:\nThe camera was set up to take pictures of a meteor shower.\nLotta:\nWhen I heard that noise out on the lake, I looked with my binoculars.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't care how many von Karmic objections I get... I'm going to find a hole in this testimony if it's the last thing I do!)\nLotta:\nOoof!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! What are you driving at?\nPhoenix:\nThe witness was not at the lake to photograph shooting stars, Your Honor!\nLotta:\n...!\nJudge:\nW-well then, what exactly was she photographing?\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! Take a look at this... What was Ms. Hart trying to photograph at the lake?\nPhoenix:\nMs. Hart. This is what you were trying to photograph!\nJudge:\nWhat's this? A newspaper article? \"Gourdy\"...? Ah, the sighting at Gourd Lake...\nPhoenix:\nWell, Ms. Hart?\nLotta:\nI... I never heard of no lake monster! You got proof or something? Let's see you prove that I was down at the lake trying to photograph this \"Gourdy.\"\nJudge:\nVery well, let's see it. And... no joking around this time, please. Here is proof that the witness was trying to photograph Gourdy, the lake monster!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! I see... I, too, thought it was a little strange.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, sure!) Well, Ms. Hart? You were camping there to try and take a photo of Gourdy, weren't you?\nLotta:\n... Yeah. Not bad. Are all you lawyers that smart? So, smart boy, I was down there trying to photograph Gourdy, you got me. So what?\nPhoenix:\nHuh...?\nLotta:\nThat don't change what I saw, does it?\nKarma:\nExactly! What you just used several precious minutes of our time to prove... is nothing more than that the witness is an idiot who thinks monsters exist!\nLotta:\nH-hey!\nKarma:\nBut, as she so succinctly said, so what!? It changes nothing!\nPhoenix:\n(Not true! You were hiding the whole thing about Gourdy for some reason, I know it! But what could it have been...? Whatever it is, I'm getting to the bottom of this!)\nJudge:\nMs. Hart. Why did you hide the fact that you were searching for Gourdy from the court? Please revise your testimony.\nLotta:\n... Right. Fine, I'll testify. It won't change nothing, though.\nPhoenix:\n(Something will change... it has to! And I'm going to spot it!)\nKarma:\n...\nWitness Testimony\n-- Lotta's New Testimony --\nLotta:\nActually, I'm not a research student at a university.\nI'm an investigative photographer.\nImagine what a scoop it'd be if I got a picture of that monster!\nThat's why I was camping out by the lake.\nBut, that's all I was hiding.\nWhen I heard the \"bang\" I looked right straight out at that lake.\nThere wasn't much else to look at, so I just watched that boat the whole time.\nThen I saw a flash, near one of the men's hands, and I heard another gunshot.\nI was looking right at that boat, the whole time, cross my heart and hope to fry.\nJudge:\nHmm... Well, Mr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.\nKarma:\nKarma:\nThe witness's testimony is unchanged from before! Whether she is a research student or a photographer has no bearing on this case! There is no need to waste more of our time with another pointless cross-examination!\nJudge:\nEr... hmm.\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nI claim the defense's right to cross-examine the witness, Your Honor! (von Karma's up to something, I know it! He doesn't want me to cross-examine her because... why? Was there a contradiction?)\nJudge:\nVery well. You may begin the cross-examination. You seem sure of yourself, you must have something in mind.\nKarma:\nHah! That would be a first!\nPhoenix:\n(Hah hah, very funny.)\nJudge:\nYou understand that this is your last chance at a cross-examination, Mr. Wright? If there is no problem with the testimony this time, we will let the witness leave. I will announce my verdict at that time, Mr. Wright. Understood?\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.\nCross Examination\n-- Lotta's New Testimony --\nLotta:\nActually, I'm not a research student at a university.\nLotta:\nI'm an investigative photographer.\nLotta:\nImagine what a scoop it'd be if I got a picture of that monster!\nLotta:\nThat's why I was camping out by the lake.\nLotta:\nBut, that's all I was hiding.\nLotta:\nWhen I heard the \"bang\" I looked right straight out at that lake.\nLotta:\nThere wasn't much else to look at, so I just watched that boat the whole time.\nLotta:\nThen I saw a flash, near one of the men's hands, and I heard another gunshot.\nPhoenix:\n(I'd better find some sort of contradiction in this testimony... I won't be able to beat von Karma any other way... There has to be something!)\nPhoenix:\nMs. Hart! Were you REALLY looking at that boat!?\nLotta:\nW-what's with you!? Course I was looking at it! It was the only thing out there! Any normal person'd be looking at it!\nPhoenix:\nI agree, any normal person would. But you are far from normal!\nLotta:\nWh-what!? Y'all wanna step over here and say that!?\nPhoenix:\nYou were camping at the lake to take a picture of Gourdy! Think about it-- What would you do if you heard a loud noise? You'd be scanning the lake for any sign of Gourdy, that's what! You wouldn't give the boat a second thought!\nLotta:\nAah!\nJudge:\nOrder! Continue, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nYou testified that you were watching the boat through binoculars! However, you wouldn't need binoculars to watch that boat! You needed them to search for Gourdy... and that's what you were doing!\nLotta:\n...! ... ...\nPhoenix:\nWell!?\nLotta:\nHmph... Well, now that y'all mention it... I did sort of take my binoculars and kind of scan the lake a bit... I mean, Gourdy might be out there, n' all...\nJudge:\nM-Ms. Hart! A-are you saying that you were NOT watching the boat, then?\nLotta:\n... S-sorry, y'all. I wasn't fibbing, really. I was, just... I thought y'know, I could be witness to a murder n' all! I kinda got excited. I was sure I was watching that boat... till now.\nJudge:\n... This... this is totally uncalled for--\nLotta:\nB-but hey! You got the photograph! You got proof!\nJudge:\nHmm... Still, we can't see who is shooting who in this.\nLotta:\nRight! Right! That's why I took this photo n'...\nKarma:\nKarma:\nWitness... That's enough. You've had a long day. Shut your pie-hole.\nLotta:\nSh-shut my what!?\nPhoenix:\n(What was she going to say? She took the photo... and what? Wait a second...)\nGumshoe:\nShe even had a photograph to prove it.\nPhoenix:\nBut you really can't tell from the photo who is shooting.\nGumshoe:\nThat's why she said she's going to enlarge the photo. She said \"it'll drop the quality a mite, but should let us see who's who!\"\nPhoenix:\n(She enlarged that photo! Why won't von Karma let her show it? I've got a hunch! I bet that enlarged photo shows something bad for von Karma! This is my chance! If I'm wrong, though, it'll mean prison for Edgeworth... or worse. What should I do!?)\nPhoenix:\nMs. Hart! Look at this photograph. You enlarged this photograph, did you not?\nLotta:\nY-yeah! I did!\nPhoenix:\nWhy has that enlargement not been presented to the court!?\nKarma:\nKarma:\nB-because it does not exist!\nLotta:\nWhat're y'all talking about!? You were the one who told me not to show it in court in the first place! You old fool!\nJudge:\nWhat's the meaning of this, Mr. von Karma!\nKarma:\nEr... erm...\nPhoenix:\nMs. Hart! Show the photo to the court! Show us the enlargement!\nKarma:\nKarma:\nThe prosecution objects to the submission of this evidence!\nJudge:\nObjection... denied. The witness will show the enlargement to the court.\nLotta:\nHere it is.\nJudge:\nHmm. We still cannot see who is firing in this. It could be the defendant... or maybe it's not. Regardless, I'll accept this as evidence.\nLake Photo added to the Court Record.\nKarma:\nHappy now, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nHmm... (There has to be something!)\nKarma:\nYou asked for the enlargement, you got the enlargement. And little good it has done any of us! That's why I requested she not show it!\nJudge:\nHmm... I suppose this means that the cross-examination...\nKarma:\nIs over! Obviously!\nJudge:\nThen, I would like to close the cross-examination of Ms. Lotta Hart.\nKarma:\nAnd none too soon. That was a flagrant waste of my time.\nJudge:\nMr. von Karma, do you have anything to add?\nKarma:\nI stated everything I needed to when this trial began. Decisive evidence. A decisive witness. What else could possibly be required?\nJudge:\nNothing, of course. Then, I believe it is time for me to declare my verdict.\nPhoenix:\n(Wait... it's not supposed to go like this! There has to be a clue in this photo... somewhere! This is bad! Real bad! What should I do!?)\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! There is something decidedly strange with this enlargement!\nJudge:\nW-what might that be? Mr. Wright... You will show the court what you mean! What about this photo is \"strange\"?\nPhoenix:\n(Okay... here goes nothing! I'll show the judge what's strange about this photo.)\nPhoenix:\nHere, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nThe shooter...? I'm not sure I understand. What about the shooter is strange?\nPhoenix:\nLook at the hand holding the pistol, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nThe hand...?\nPhoenix:\nThat hand directly contradicts another piece of evidence!\nJudge:\nThis man's left hand does what...!?\nPhoenix:\nLet me show you. I'll show you the evidence that left hand contradicts!\nPhoenix:\nThe evidence is clear. The man in this photograph is holding that pistol in his left hand. However! The prints on the murder weapon were from Edgeworth's \"right hand\"! Ergo! The man shooting the pistol in this photograph... Is not Mr. Edgeworth!!!\nJudge:\nNow that everyone in the courtroom has quieted down... I would like to reconvene this court of law! Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nYou have given us definitive proof today. We now know that it was not Mr. Edgeworth who fired the pistol that night. However... This leaves us with a rather large problem. If Mr. Edgeworth didn't do it, then who shot our victim?\nKarma:\nPrecisely! As we have seen, there were no other people on the lake that night! Who but the defendant could have shot the victim!?\nPhoenix:\nThere is only one explanation remaining! The man who shot the victim was none other than... the victim himself!!!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! So... you are saying that the victim committed suicide?\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. I can think of no other explanation.\nJudge:\nHmm... Indeed, that does seem to be the only remaining option.\nKarma:\nKarma:\nI'm so very, very sorry, Mr. Wright. But suicide is out of the question.\nPhoenix:\nWh-what!?\nKarma:\nAn examination of the victim's wound reveals the distance at which he was shot.\nPhoenix:\nThe... distance?\nKarma:\nThe victim was clearly shot from further than a meter away!\nPhoenix:\nA meter! Th-that's three feet!\nKarma:\nThere is no way it could have been suicide!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Mr. von Karma! Are you sure of the accuracy of your data!?\nKarma:\nOf course! I had already considered the possibility of suicide, you see.\nAutopsy Report updated in the Court Record.\nJudge:\nHmm... I see. Very well, allow me to state my opinion. Considering the situation, the shooter had to be the defendant, Mr. Edgeworth. However! The prints on the gun reveal that the shooter was not Mr. Edgeworth. This is a conundrum. Therefore, I would like to suspend proceedings for this trial for the day. The court orders the defense and the prosecution to further investigate this matter. Understood?\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.\nKarma:\n...\nJudge:\nThat is all. The court is adjourned.\nDecember 26, 1:15 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2\nPhoenix:\nWhew, that was a close one.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nHey! Don't you have anything to say!?\nEdgeworth:\nNo. I have yet to be declared innocent, Wright.\nPhoenix:\nWell, yeah, but... What happened out there on that lake, anyway!? If he didn't commit suicide, then who...? The shooter was about a meter away, too!\nEdgeworth:\n... W-what? Don't give me that look! I did not kill him!\nPhoenix:\nI was just kidding around.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph.\nPhoenix:\nLook... I'm going to go check on Maya.\nEdgeworth:\nOh... Wright.\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nEdgeworth:\nTell her something for me.\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nEdgeworth:\n... ... ... Tell... Tell her to watch what she says in court. That's all.\nPhoenix:\n(Would it kill you to just state how you really feel with a \"thanks\", Edgeworth?) (Changed from [Yeah, I'm sure she'll be happy to hear you say that, Edgeworth. Jerk!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nI requisitioned a transcript of Lotta's entire testimony. I thought it might give me some ammunition for the trial tomorrow. Of course she didn't see the shooter... So the only part of her testimony that stood was the \"bang\" she heard.\nLotta's Deposition added to the Court Record.\nTo be continued.\n\nDecember 26Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\nMaya!\nMaya:\nHey!

(Changed from [Though you did save Edgeworth, I guess...] in the original release) I just wasn't sure how to thank you... you know?\nPhoenix:\nEr... thanks.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nGumshoe:\nI'm going to head back to the station. I'll get the report on Maya and get her out of there as soon as I can.\nPhoenix:\nThank you. Oh, wait! Umm... I was wondering, how much is bail going to be?\nGumshoe:\nDon't worry about that. Mr. Edgeworth is posting the whole amount.\nPhoenix:\nWhat? Edgeworth...?\nGumshoe:\nDidn't I tell you? He's grateful to her for what she did. Alright, pal. Well don't forget to go pick her up, okay?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm...

Oh, that reminds me... Thanks for bail.\nPhoenix:\nThank Edgeworth.\nMaya:\nHuh?\nPhoenix:\nHe posted bail for you. Said he was grateful for what you did.\nMaya:\nMr. Edgeworth did that...? ...

I'll behave.\nPhoenix:\n(Oh dear...)\nDecember 26Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\nLooks like Edgeworth is in questioning.\nMaya:\nLet's come back later.\nPhoenix:\nGuess so...\nDecember 26Gourd Lake ParkEntrance\nMaya:\nThere aren't many cops around today, are there?\nPhoenix:\nThey're probably back at the precinct, working up the case against Edgeworth.\nMaya:\nMmm...\nLotta:\nHey y'all!\nMaya:\nHey, it's Lotta!\nLotta:\nY'all really did it today...\nPhoenix:\nWh-what did we do now?\nLotta:\nNaw, I'm not complaining! See, I did a little thinking. A little... self-reflection, you might say. I realized that bein' a witness is a mighty big responsibility. But I just went up there and started blabbing any old thing that came to mind.\nPhoenix:\nLotta...\nLotta:\nSo, you see, I want to make it up to y'all.\nPhoenix:\n\"Make it up\"...?\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nLotta:\nThe only fair exchange for information is... information! Listen good-- What I need from you is information about Gourdy!\nMaya:\nWhoa-whoa-whoa! G-Gourdy!?\nPhoenix:\nB-but Gourdy doesn't... I mean, Gourdy might not exist!\nLotta:\nThen bring me proof that shows he don't!\nPhoenix:\nUh...\nLotta:\nI'll be keepin' watch from the car, okay? You see something, y'all come to me first, got it?\nPhoenix:\nO-okay...\nLotta:\nRight! See y'all later!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nOkay, Nick, let's get hunting!\nPhoenix:\nH-hunting...? You don't seriously mean...\nMaya:\nGourdy? I sure do!\nPhoenix:\nWhat about Edgeworth!?\nMaya:\nWe're searching for Gourdy for him, Nick! Don't you get it!?\nPhoenix:\n(Okay... and how exactly do we search for a make-believe monster...? Maybe we can find a monster myth specialist?)\nDecember 26Gourd LakePublic Beach\nPhoenix:\nWh-what's that?\nMaya:\nTh-the Steel Samurai, Nick.\nButz:\nYo! Maya!\nPhoenix:\nLarry! What the heck is that!? (Changed from [Larry! What the heck is this!?] in the original release)\nButz:\nOh, it was my girl Kiyance's idea... She was all \"if you like, put this here, it would be, like, really cool!\" Dude, she gave it to me along with the banner!\nMaya:\nWow! That's really impressive she could find those for you!\nButz:\nWell, she knows a lot of people. And that show's finished now, so she got 'em for free.\nPhoenix:\nRight...\nDecember 26Boat Rental Shop\nMaya:\n... It’s always so quiet, here.

What's up? You look out of sorts. Wait... you didn't go and do something that's going to hurt Mr. Edgeworth's case again!\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean, \"again\"!?\nGumshoe:\nWhatever, have a seat, pal.

Let's come back later.\nGourd Lake Public Beach\nGourd Lake Woods\nPhoenix:\nSo, tell us this \"information\" you have.\nLotta:\nA promise is a promise, I guess... I overheard the cops around here saying something about the witness tomorrow... They said he's the caretaker of the boat rental place up the path here.\nMaya:\nBoat rental...? There's someone there? I mean, it looks so deserted.\nLotta:\nJust an old guy, living all by himself. Y'all should go check it out.\nMaya:\nThanks, Lotta! We will! Let's get cracking, Nick!\nLotta:\nHold on.\nPhoenix:\nSomething else?\nLotta:\nYeah... the night of the murder. My camera clicked twice, you know.\nMaya:\n...! Wait... so you have another photo?\nLotta:\nWell... Yeah, but there's nothing in it at all. Just the lake. I figured it wouldn't be much use as evidence, so I kept it to myself. Well, it might not be helpful at all, but... Here, take it.\nSecond Lake Photo added to the Court Record.\nLotta:\nBye now. Y'all take care. Time for me to pack up and leave.\nMaya:\n... Poor Lotta...\nPhoenix:\nIt's all Larry's fault. The legend still lives on, I guess.\nMaya:\nThe \"legend\"...?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, the legend of Larry, familiar to all who know him for any length of time... \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\"\nMaya:\nHmm. Someone should whip that Butz into shape.\nDecember 26Boat Rental Shop\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! This is the boat shop that Lotta was talking about!\nPhoenix:\nYou're right.

You make your old man proud. When you kids left the house, I didn't know what to think. How'm I supposed to keep this place running, an old man like me? Polly! The kids are home!\nParrot:\n\"Hello! Hello!\" *squawk*\nMaya:\nN-Nick! What was that!?\nPhoenix:\nA parrot... the one on the perch.\nUncle:\nKeith!\nPhoenix:\nY-yes!?\nUncle:\nI leave the \"Wet Noodle\" in your capable hands, sonny.\nMaya:\nN-Nick? What's the \"Wet Noodle\"?\nPhoenix:\nUm, based on the available evidence, I'd say it's the name of his pasta shop.\nUncle:\nThat's a relief, isn't it, Polly?\nParrot:\n\"Hello! Hello!\" *squawk*\nUncle:\nAyup... ... *Zzzzz*\nMaya:\nHe fell asleep...\nPhoenix:\nI guess he's relieved.\nAfter clearing \"Polly\" and \"What you saw\" Talk options:\nUncle:\nYou know what? Eh? Little Terry was just here.\nPhoenix:\n\"Terry\"...?\nUncle:\nAyup, that kid next door. You always used to make him cry, remember? He was wearin' this tattered old coat. Got himself some whiskers growing out of his face.\nPhoenix:\n(He must be talking about Detective Gumshoe...)\nUncle:\nHe comes up and tells me to come down to court tomorrow.\nMaya:\nReally...?\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow I don't think we're going to get much useful information out of this guy.)

Have we forgotten something?\nParrot:\n*squawk* \"Don't forget DL-6!\" *squawk*\nMaya:\nH-huh!?

Who could that old man be...? I think I need to do a little more research on this DL-6 Incident...

Sounds like you need information on the DL-6 Incident. Through there is the Station's Records Room. I'll give you special permission to go in and find what you need.\nMaya:\nAll right! Way to go, Detective Gumshoe! Okay, Nick! To the Records Room!\nPhoenix:\n(I guess it's time we faced Edgeworth's past...)\nDecember 26Police DepartmentRecords Room\nMaya:\nWow!!! It's amazing.........ly dusty.\nPhoenix:\nTen years of files and ten years of dust, I guess.\nMaya:\nLet's find that DL-6 stuff quick!\nPhoenix:\n(Fifteen years ago... both me and Edgeworth were nine years old. We were almost through with fourth grade when he suddenly transferred. Because of DL-6...?)\nMaya:\nNick! I found out where the file is!\nPhoenix:\nO-oh, thanks!\nMaya:\nJust let me know what you want to know about the DL-6 Incident! I'll go get the right file!\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\nI guess I know generally what happened in DL-6 now. I still don't know what sort of impact the whole thing had on Edgeworth...\nMaya:\nNick. Are we going to take the whole file? There's too much! We'll never get it out.\nPhoenix:\nY-you're right. How about we just take what we think we'll need...\nDL-6 Case File added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nRight. That's probably all we'll be able to find here.

I was taking a meaningful pause before speaking!\nJudge:\nR-right, of course.\nKarma:\nA prediction! Today's trial will end three minutes from now!\nJudge:\nOrder... order! Mr. von Karma! What is the meaning of your statement just now!?\nKarma:\nKarma:\nBah! Must you question everything! It will be over in three minutes! We have no time to waste! I'll call my witness now!\nJudge:\nR-right...\nKarma:\nI call my witness... my decisive witness to the stand!\nPhoenix:\n(It's that mysterious boat shop owner.)\nKarma:\nWitness... state your profession.\nUncle:\nMmph... zzzz... ...

We still haven't heard who this old guy is!)\nPhoenix:\nWait a minute! The witness hasn't stated his name yet!\nKarma:\nKarma:\nBecause I did not ask him, Mr. Wright! Bah! I have predicted this trial will end in three minutes! Stop asking trivial questions and cooperate!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, right!)\nJudge:\nThe witness will state his name.\nUncle:\nZzzz... ... Mmph! Well, er... I'm not really sure, ayup.\nJudge:\nWhat do you mean?\nUncle:\nMy, er, memory...\nKarma:\nYour Honor... The witness does not remember anything beyond the last several years... Ergo, he cannot recall his own name.\nJudge:\nHmm... he can't recall, you say?\nKarma:\nYes, but the incident in question took place three days ago. He can testify.\nJudge:\nVery well. Let's hear his testimony then, shall we.

D-Dad!\nUncle:\nDead certain, Keith! He said \"I can't believe he's dead\" as he was walking by, too.\nKarma:\nWitness! Are you sure that the person you saw was Miles Edgeworth!?\nUncle:\nIt was him! That Edgeworth boy!\nJudge:\n... This... sounds like decisive evidence indeed. I see no room for doubt.\nPhoenix:\n(von Karma... He lured me into cross-examining so he could set me up for a fall!)\nKarma:\nTsk, tsk, tsk...\nMaya:\nN-Nick...! I don't like the way things are going here!

Nick needs you...\nKarma:\nTsk tsk tsk... Three minutes was perhaps too high an expectation. However, fifteen minutes isn't bad! This must be a new record.\nJudge:\nEnough! The witness may leave the stand.\nUncle:\nZzzz...\nJudge:\nThis court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant.

I was sitting here in the audience, listening to the testimony... Then I realized, something he said was different from what I remember!

I just wonder what Larry plans to say in there.\nMaya:\nLarry was at the lake that night?\nPhoenix:\nYes... He said he went looking for the Steel Samurai balloon that flew into the lake.\nMaya:\nOh right. And he found the balloon and the air tank that night?\nPhoenix:\nYeah.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nHey, Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\n... Huh? You say something, Wright?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, a lot of things. You seem out of it. What's wrong?\nEdgeworth:\nIt... it's nothing.\nPhoenix:\nHmm?\nMaya:\nUmm... Mr. Edgeworth? There's something I've been meaning to ask you.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat's that?\nMaya:\nWhy are your fingerprints on the murder weapon?\nEdgeworth:\nOh. When he fell into the lake, I went into a daze. I couldn't understand what had happened. I couldn't think straight. Then I saw the pistol lying on the floor of the boat in front of me. I picked it up without thinking. I didn't have a reason, really.\nMaya:\nI see...\nEdgeworth:\nWright...\nPhoenix:\nYeah?\nEdgeworth:\nThis might be our chance.\nPhoenix:\nOur chance?\nEdgeworth:\nvon Karma has only ever run perfect trials.\nPhoenix:\nPerfect trials...?\nEdgeworth:\nPerfectly prepared witnesses, perfectly complete evidence. That's the secret to his success. This is the first time he's ever had to deal with something unexpected! He has to let someone he hasn't even talked to testify before the court! (Changed from [He has let someone he hasn't even talked to testify before the court!] in the original release) And that someone... is Larry!\nPhoenix:\nWhat are you getting at?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's likely his testimony will be full of holes, Wright.\nMaya:\nThat's right, Nick! No ten minute trial this time! We'll milk this one for all it's worth!\nPhoenix:\nHey, it was fifteen minutes! Fifteen! (Everything's on Larry now...) (Changed from [Hey, it was fifteen minutes!

That was an unusually vague testimony, even for this court. In any matter, Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor...\nMaya:\nWhat's wrong, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nIt's Larry! I have no idea what he's going to say if I press him.

You're sure!?\nButz:\nThat's what I said!\nPhoenix:\nBut Mr. Lotta Hart testified yesterday that she heard two \"bang\"s! And the old man just now said the same thing! They both heard two gunshots that night!\nButz:\nHuh?\nPhoenix:\nWere you even listening!? Were you paying attention at all to what they said?\nButz:\nYo, Nick, please!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nButz:\nYou know, something's been bothering me. I'm a witness, see? I'm like a customer here! So you got to treat me nice and stuff, okay!?\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\nMr. Butz.\nButz:\nWhat!?\nJudge:\nYou only heard one gunshot? Are you sure?\nButz:\n... Umm... Well, to tell ya the truth... I'm not sure.\nJudge:\nEh...?\nPhoenix:\nNot sure!? H-how could you not be sure?\nButz:\nYeah, well... I, uh, I might have missed the other gunshot. I was, uh, listening to something else...\nPhoenix:\nSomething... else?\nButz:\nMy radio, dude! With my headphones. (Changed from [My radio, dude! On my headphones.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nWhaaaaaaat!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! And stop that booing! M-Mr. Butz! You were listening to the radio with your headphones? (Changed from [You were listening to a radio on earphones?] in the original release)\nButz:\nY-yeah! So what! That a crime!? I listen to my radio! Everybody listens to the radio! What's the big deal!?\nJudge:\nHmm... Mr. von Karma... your opinion?\nKarma:\nWaste of time. I do not accept this witness, nor his shoddy testimony.\nJudge:\nHmm... Well, Mr. Wright? Should he continue the testimony?\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor. Please... please allow the witness to continue his testimony.\nKarma:\nBah! Nothing is more pitiful than a lawyer who doesn't know when he's lost!\nJudge:\nVery well, Mr. Butz. Please give your testimony, and be sure to include details like your RADIO.\nButz:\nRight! Leave it to me!\nPhoenix:\n(I wouldn't if there were any other way out of this, believe me.)\nWitness Testimony\n-- What Larry Heard --\nButz:\nIt's lonely, being alone on Christmas Eve!\nThat's why I was listening to an all-requests show on the radio, see?\nI was listening to it real booming loud, like.\nBut I'm sure I heard that gunshot!\nI remember exactly what the DJ was saying when I heard it, too.\nJudge:\nYou were listening to your radio... at a high volume!?\nButz:\nYeah, what's the big problem? Can't a man listen to his radio in peace? Isn't this a free country!?\nPhoenix:\n(I truly believe Larry has no idea what the problem here is.)\nKarma:\nJudge. Can you believe a word this witness says? What he heard was probably nothing more than a drum beat from the radio!\nJudge:\nTrue enough, it is difficult to believe this testimony.\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWait, Your Honor! The witness said he remembers exactly what the DJ said when he heard the gunshot!\nJudge:\nExcuse me? \"Dee-jay\"...?\nPhoenix:\nAn announcer... the guy who says things on the radio. Anyway! What this means is, when he heard the sound, no music was playing! The DJ only talks between songs! So he could have heard the gunshot from the lake! I'd like to cross-examine the witness, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nV-very well, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe I'm continuing this charade...)\nCross Examination\n-- What Larry Heard --\nButz:\nIt's lonely, being alone on Christmas Eve!\nButz:\nThat's why I was listening to an all-requests show on the radio, see?\nButz:\nI was listening to it real booming loud, like.\nButz:\nBut I'm sure I heard that gunshot!\nButz:\nI remember exactly what the DJ was saying when I heard it, too.\nButz:\nJust when she said \"Hey! It's almost Christmas!\" I heard the gunshot!\nPhoenix:\n(This is the most ludicrous testimony I've ever heard. But there is one gleaming ray of hope in there! I've got to press it until we get to the bottom of what happened!)\nPhoenix:\nThis is a clear contradiction, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! What does this mean? The two prior witnesses heard gunshots after midnight. However, this witness says he heard a gunshot before midnight...\nKarma:\nJudge. The answer is simple. The current witness is plainly mistaken. Just look at him! Suspicious!\nButz:\nWh-whaaat!?\nJudge:\nHmm... Well, Mr. Wright? What do you think about Mr. Butz's claim that he heard the gunshot before midnight?\nPhoenix:\nLarry's not mistaken, Your Honor! He heard that gunshot before midnight!\nKarma:\n... Intriguing. I'm assuming you have evidence for this wild claim? Show me evidence there was a gunshot before midnight!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Hmm... That would make sense of the evidence we've seen so far. ... However... This leaves me wondering exactly what did happen that night on the lake.\nKarma:\nExactly! If this is true, there were two sets of gunshots, separated by 25 minutes! One at 11:50, another at 15 minutes after midnight! Why, I ask you! Why!?\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh, I'd better think of something quick! ... Wait a second...! Gunshots separated by 25 minutes...?) Aaaaaaaaaaah!\nMaya:\nWh-what's wrong, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI have it! I have it!\nMaya:\nHuh?\nPhoenix:\nRemember the case with the Steel Samurai!?\nMaya:\nHuh? Yeah, of course I remember...\nPhoenix:\nThe murderer in this case had the same idea as the murderer in that case!\nMaya:\nWhat do you mean?\nPhoenix:\nMaya!\nMaya:\nYes!?\nPhoenix:\nIf we don't figure this out now, we'll never overturn Edgeworth's guilty verdict! I've got a hunch, and I'm going to run with it...\nMaya:\nRight! I mean... is this safe?\nPhoenix:\nSafe? We've already gotten a guilty verdict! We have nothing to lose!\nMaya:\n...\nPhoenix:\nYou just watch and let me know if I say anything that sounds fishy, okay?\nMaya:\nRight, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor!\nJudge:\nY-yes, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nThe testimony just now has cleared up this entire case!\nJudge:\nWhat do you mean, Mr. Wright!?\nKarma:\nTsk tsk tsk... So, you've finally realized the truth? There can be no other murderer here than Miles Edgeworth himself.\nPhoenix:\nWrong, von Karma! A man was shot that night, but it wasn't Edgeworth who did the shooting!\nKarma:\nListen, rookie. Take a deep breath, and consider the facts. At the time of the murder, one boat was on the lake. This was shown by the witness's photograph. The defendant, Edgeworth, and victim, Robert Hammond, were on that boat. There was a gunshot fired on that boat, and Robert Hammond fell into the lake. The distance of the shooting was one meter. It couldn't have been suicide! Well? The guilty party has to be the other man on that boat!\nJudge:\nI admit, it is hard to imagine any other possibility.\nPhoenix:\nYes... But this assumes that the victim was shot at 15 minutes after midnight.\nJudge:\n... What do you mean by that, Mr. Wright? We have photographic evidence of the time of the shooting. The timestamp on the photo says 00:15.\nPhoenix:\nBut Larry heard a gunshot 25 minutes before that! Robert Hammond was killed then! 25 minutes before the shot on the lake! (That's the only way that Edgeworth could be innocent!)\nJudge:\n...\nKarma:\n... Mr. Wright. Are you quite mad? Explain who the two men on the boat are! (Changed from [Explain who this is sitting on the boat!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nOf course, it was Edgeworth and the murderer! After the murderer killed Robert Hammond at 11:50... He assumed the guise of Mr. Hammond and met Edgeworth!\nJudge:\nWh... What!? Are you serious?\nPhoenix:\nYes. Edgeworth won't tell us why he went to the lake that night. However, I have a hunch. That night, Robert Hammond called Edgeworth to the lake. Now, Edgeworth didn't know Robert Hammond's face that well. That's why he didn't suspect anything when the murderer took Robert Hammond's place!\nJudge:\n... I'm not sure what to make of all this.\nKarma:\nL-Ludicrous!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. Tell us the name of the murderer then!\nPhoenix:\nThe murderer's name...? Right! It's...\nPhoenix:\nActually, I don't know the murderer's name.\nJudge:\nY-you don't know!?\nKarma:\nBah! Again, you waste my time!\nPhoenix:\nI don't know because he never told us!\nKarma:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nThe murderer is the caretaker of the boat shop, that old man! At 11:50, he was the one who killed Robert Hammond.\nJudge:\nThe caretaker of the boat shop!? Wh-where did he do this!? There weren't any boats on the lake then!\nPhoenix:\nWhy would he have to go all the way out on the lake just to shoot someone? May I suggest... That the real scene of the crime was not in a boat!\nJudge:\nWhat!? W-well then, where did the murder take place!?\nPhoenix:\n(Show the judge where the murder really took place!)\nPhoenix:\nHere, of course! The boat shop, where he lives. That way he could meet with the victim without anyone seeing!\nKarma:\nKarma:\nDo you have proof that the boat shop was the scene of the crime!?\nPhoenix:\nRecall Larry's testimony if you will. That night he was out on the lake in a boat, searching for something. He finds it, and returns the boat. Then, just as he's starting to head for home, he hears a gunshot! He heard a gunshot, Your Honor! Even though he was wearing headphones at the time! In other words, the gunshot was very, very close by! And where would that be if he had just returned a boat?\nJudge:\nThe boat shop...! Mr. Wright! What happened that night on Gourd Lake!? Please tell the court, from the beginning!\nPhoenix:\nY-yes, Your Honor.\nMaya:\nNick, are you sure about this...?\nPhoenix:\nUm, not really. But, I think if I start at the very beginning... And I take it slow, I must just be able to figure this out...\nPhoenix:\nThat night... The caretaker of the boat shop called Robert Hammond to his shop. This was around 11:50. That was when the gunshot that Larry heard was fired. After that, the caretaker put on Robert Hammond's coat... He became Robert Hammond! Then he got in the boat with Edgeworth, and went out into the middle of the lake.\nJudge:\nThen... who fired the pistol on the boat, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nOf course, it was the murderer who shot the pistol. He shot twice. Both missed Edgeworth, on purpose.\nJudge:\nWait a minute...\nPhoenix:\nY-yes?\nJudge:\nWhy would he shoot twice if he didn't mean to hit anyone?\nPhoenix:\nUh... (Details! Details!)\nKarma:\nKnow this, Mr. Wright. The moment you run out of explanations is the moment you lose. Tell us why the murderer had to fire twice!\nPhoenix:\nI believe he shot twice to create a witness, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nCreate a witness...?\nPhoenix:\nThe murderer lifts his pistol and fires one shot. That ensures that anyone who heard the shot would look at the lake. Indeed, Ms. Hart did exactly that after hearing the first gunshot. Next! The murderer waits a bit and he fires again. Then... The murderer jumps from the boat himself! Leaving the pistol in the boat behind him.\nJudge:\n... I see! To someone looking from the edge of the lake... It would appear that one of the men on the boat had shot the other!\nPhoenix:\nThe murderer didn't know about the automatic camera, of course. That's why he shot twice to draw attention to the boat!\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\nOnce you realize that, everything else falls into place! The boat shop caretaker swam back to his shop. Then he put Mr. Hammond's coat back on the body. And threw the body into the lake! This is what happened, Your Honor. These are the events that transpired that night on Gourd Lake.\nJudge:\n...\nKarma:\n...\n...\nJudge:\n... Bailiff! Bring out the witness from before! The boat shop caretaker! Quickly!\nJudge:\nVery well. While we are waiting for the caretaker... I would like to ask the defendant, Miles Edgeworth, a few questions. Mr. Edgeworth. Please take the stand.\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth... You heard what the defense has said?\nEdgeworth:\nYes.\nJudge:\nWell? Why did you go to the lake that night?\nEdgeworth:\n... What Wright has said was mostly correct. Astonishingly so, actually. Yes... Several days ago, I received a letter. The letter was signed, \"Robert Hammond.\" He asked me to come to the boat shop by the lake at midnight on Christmas Eve. He said he had something very important to discuss with me.\nJudge:\nSomething important?\nEdgeworth:\n... I'm sorry. I can't say what it was.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nGuard:\nYour Honor, sir!\nJudge:\nBailiff! We are conducting a trial here, I ask that you remain quiet...\nGuard:\nThe witness has disappeared! He isn't at the boat shop, either!\nJudge:\nWhat!?\nGuard:\nWhat should I do?\nJudge:\nF-find him, quickly! We cannot allow him to get away!\nJudge:\nMr. von Karma! Your witness has disappeared!\nKarma:\n... A search warrant has already been issued.\nJudge:\nHmm... It goes without saying that I cannot declare a verdict under these circumstances. I will extend the trial until tomorrow, the final day allowed. I request that the police department utilize all its forces to find that witness! Am I understood?\nKarma:\n...\nJudge:\nOne more thing. Just who is that boat shop caretaker? I think his identity has become very important to this trial. I want him, and I want to know who he is.\nKarma:\n...\nJudge:\nVery well. Court is adjourned!\nDecember 27, 1:22 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2\nMaya:\nYay, Nick! You did it!\nPhoenix:\nYeah... Well, at least we got out from under that guilty verdict...\nMaya:\nAnd what about Larry! That was something else! Even von Karma didn't know what to do with his testimony! Larry really helped us out!\nPhoenix:\nSure, once I sifted through his \"unique\" testimony. Still... he did save us. I just wish our cases weren't so down to the wire all the time.\nMaya:\nI know what you mean. Sometimes I feel like it's us on trial instead of our clients!\nPhoenix:\nHey, Edgeworth...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nMaya:\nUmm... Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n! D-did you say something?\nMaya:\nDon't look so pained! I mean, it looks like you're probably going to get off the hook! You could try to smile just a little...? Relax!\nEdgeworth:\n... I'm sorry... But... I fear it's not over for me yet.\nPhoenix:\nWh-what do you mean?\nEdgeworth:\nWright... There's something that's been troubling me for a long time now. And I don't know whether or not to tell you...\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nNo... there's so little time left. I want to tell you, to get it off my chest, but... ... Hmm. I can't make up my mind. ...\nPhoenix:\nWhat is this about, Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n... It's... a nightmare I've had.

I don't believe it!\nGrossberg:\nYogi was suspected of murder, and his career as bailiff was irrevocably wrecked. Thus, he sought revenge on Miles Edgeworth.

The prosecution... is ready.\nJudge:\n... U-uh... right, very well. We have reached the final day of our proceedings in this trial. I ask that the prosecution submit decisive evidence.\nKarma:\nUnderstood.\nJudge:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(C'mon! Don't be awed into silence by every little thing he says!)\nJudge:\nVery well, Mr. von Karma, your opening statement.\nKarma:\nRight. Thanks to Detective Gumshoe's efforts, the boat rental shop caretaker has been arrested. In yesterday's trial, the defense asserted that the caretaker was the murderer. However, the caretaker has yet to confirm this. I would like to ask the defense to cross-examine him as much as necessary.\nJudge:\nVery well! Please bring the witness into the courtroom.\nKarma:\nLadies and gentlemen of the court... I believe you all remember our witness. He lives in the boat rental shop on the lake, from where he witnessed the incident. In addition, he has currently lost memory of his name and identity.\nJudge:\nWitness!

Do that and the motive will prove itself!)\nAfter pressing fourth and fifth statements:\nJudge:\nMight I say something, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nYes... Yes, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nYou've been saying the same thing now over and over. You've been calling the witness's memory of the past or lack thereof into question. But, does this really have anything to do with the current case?\nPhoenix:\nOf course, Your Honor. The witness has said he has \"nothing to do with this case\" and \"no motive\"... Both of these statements are lies!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Mr. Wright! There is a serious problem with your claim! Or... are you saying... Are you saying you know who this witness is!?\nPhoenix:\nOf course, Your Honor!\nKarma:\nHo hoh! Now, this is interesting. I would like to know myself! So, who is he?\nPhoenix:\n(Don't play dumb von Karma!)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, please tell us this witness's name.\nPhoenix:\nHis name is Yanni Yogi, a former court bailiff!\nJudge:\n... Yogi...? That name seems familiar. ... Oh! Yanni Yogi! From the DL-6 Incident!\nPhoenix:\n(I thought the judge would have heard of it... it was such a famous case.)\nJudge:\nBut, what does this mean?\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! If this man is Mr. Yogi, then he has a clear motive!\nKarma:\nKarma:\nTsk tsk tsk... Jumping to conclusions again, Mr. Wright! This man, this witness, is Yanni Yogi? Fascinating! However... How do you propose to prove this to the court?\nPhoenix:\n...\nKarma:\nThis is a court of law, as you may recall. You need proof! And, allow me to repeat, once more, that the witness has lost his memory!\nPhoenix:\n(This is it... I have to do this now! If I can't prove he's Yogi right here, right now... Then I've got nowhere else to go!)\nMaya:\nNick! How are you going to prove it!? How can you prove that he's Yanni Yogi?\nPhoenix:\nIt's okay. It's actually quite simple. Your Honor! Please take this man's fingerprints! Then, we'll compare them to the fingerprints on file for Yanni Yogi 15 years ago...\nJudge:\nI see... that makes sense.\nKarma:\nTsk tsk tsk!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nKarma:\nI'm so very, very sorry, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nWh-why?\nKarma:\nThe witness... has no fingerprints!\nPhoenix:\nWhat? What!? No fingerprints!?\nUncle:\nEr... you see, before I worked as a caretaker, I worked at a chemical plant. I burned my fingers working with the stuff. Ayup.\nPhoenix:\nWh-what!? (Yogi, you sneak! You burned your fingerprints off to hide your past!)\nJudge:\nHmm... Well, if the witness has no fingerprints... I guess we will not be able to prove his identity.\nPhoenix:\n(No...!)\nKarma:\nTsk tsk tsk... Well, what will you do, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nUh...\nKarma:\nHmm? It seems that the case has been decided, no?\nPhoenix:\n(No!!! I know what happened! I know everything! I... I just can't prove it! But no... I can't let it end like this. I can't lose! There has to be another way!)\nKarma:\nThere is no one who can testify as to who this witness is! No one!\nMaya:\nNick! What are we going to do!?\nPhoenix:\nI didn't even consider that he might have erased his fingerprints... (What do I do!?)\nKarma:\nTsk tsk tsk... Well, Mr. Wright?

You were the one who suggested I cross-examine the parrot, von Karma! I have a right to do as you suggested!\nKarma:\nMmph... ... Well, if you're so desperate, then please, be my guest.\nPhoenix:\n!\nKarma:\nOf course, should you go through with this... And nothing comes of it, then I hope you're ready for the consequences.\nMaya:\nNick... this is crazy!\nKarma:\nWell? Still want to go through with your little game!?\nJudge:\nBailiff!

I think we've reached a conclusion here.\nKarma:\nThis is a mere coincidence, that's all!\nJudge:\nTrue, that is a possibility. However, two coincidences at the same time seems more like a \"pattern\" to me.\nKarma:\nWh... what are you saying!?\nJudge:\nSummon the caretaker of the boat shop. Immediately!\nJudge:\nWitness...

He looks totally different!\nPhoenix:\nThis is the real Yogi, I think. Finally. He's been acting feeble to hide his true identity. Acting... for 15 years!\nJudge:\nW-well...! Let me ask you again. Please state your name for the court!\nYogi:\nMy name... is Yanni Yogi. 15 years ago, I served as a bailiff in this very court.\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Yanni Yogi! So was it you who killed Robert Hammond...? And tried to frame Miles Edgeworth for his death?\nYogi:\n... Yes.  It was me. I did it. ... They put me on the witness stand 15 years ago... Robert Hammond... he said I was mentally unsound. He told me it would make me innocent. Get me off the hook. So... I pretended to have brain damage... I was innocent, really! But he didn't believe me! We won the trial... But I lost everything. I lost my job, my fiancée, my social standing... ([fiancée] not accented in the original release) ... Then, this year, 15 years later... A package arrived. It was a letter... and a pistol. The plan was written out in careful detail. It was a plan for me to take my revenge on the people who ruined my life. I didn't care who had sent it. I thought this was my chance, after 15 years, this was it! Finally, a chance to have my revenge on Robert Hammond and Miles Edgeworth... I have no regrets.\nJudge:\nW-wait a moment! Revenge... against Miles Edgeworth? What do you mean?\nYogi:\nI'm not at liberty to speak on that matter. Why don't you ask Mr. Edgeworth yourself? Anyway, I admit it, I was the one who killed Robert Hammond.\nJudge:\nvon Karma... Where is Mr. Yogi?\nKarma:\nUnder arrest, Your Honor. I saw no room for error in his confession.\nJudge:\nThen... the defendant, Miles Edgeworth is...\nKarma:\nInnocent. In this case, at least.\nJudge:\nHmm. Very well. Will the defendant please take the stand?\nJudge:\nThere are a few mysteries left unsolved. Still, you are cleared of suspicion for this particular case. So I would like to pass judgment on the murder of Mr. Robert Hammond. Any objections?\nPhoenix:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nKarma:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(I don't believe it! Why isn't von Karma saying anything?)\nJudge:\nVery well. This court finds the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth...\nNot Guilty\nJudge:\nThat is all. The court is adjourned!\nEdgeworth:\nJudge:\nD-did someone just say \"objection\"?\nPhoenix:\n(It wasn't von Karma...! Wait, but that means...) No... Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor. I object to your judgment.\nJudge:\nWh-what do you mean?\nEdgeworth:\nI'm not innocent at all! As we have heard, Yanni Yogi killed Robert Hammond in revenge. But, revenge for what?\nMaya:\nNick! Edgeworth is trying to confess! He's going to say he's guilty! He's going to tell them he was the murderer in the DL-6 Incident! He's going to tell them he killed his own dad!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh! What do I do?)\nEdgeworth:\nFor fifteen years... I have had a recurring dream. A nightmare... it's only a nightmare. That's what I told myself. But now I know, it wasn't a dream. Yanni Yogi wasn't the killer.\nJudge:\nYou mean... in the incident where your father died?\nEdgeworth:\nFrom the distance of the shot, it wasn't suicide, either. Everything was as clear as day. The murderer... The criminal in the DL-6 Incident... It was me! Your Honor! I confess my guilt! I am guilty for DL-6, the statute of limitations of which ends today! The culprit... is me!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! This is certainly unexpected! The defendant, declared innocent, is confessing to a different crime! A crime for which the statute of limitations runs out today! I'm not really sure how I should deal with this...\nKarma:\nBah! It's obvious. We hold a trial. Right here. Right now. We try this man for his crime of fifteen years ago!\nJudge:\nI think... I think I would like to take a five-minute recess. During this time, I will consider the appropriate course of action to take.

(Changed from [Then, I would like to resume our trial.] in the original release)\nKarma:\nJudge! Miles Edgeworth has admitted his own guilt. He has confessed his crime. Let us begin by hearing his testimony. Then, though pointless, let the defense do their cross-examining. The statute of limitations on the DL-6 Incident runs out today. Though it's unconventional for me, I'd like to run this one by the book.\nJudge:\nI see. Does the defense have any objections?\nPhoenix:\nNo, Your Honor. (von Karma... you knew this was going to happen from the very beginning, didn't you!)\nJudge:\nVery well. Will Miles Edgeworth take the stand?\nKarma:\nWill the witness state his name and profession.\nEdgeworth:\nMiles Edgeworth... I am a prosecuting attorney.\nKarma:\nMr. Edgeworth. Fifteen years ago, you mistakenly killed your father, Gregory Edgeworth. Is this correct?\nEdgeworth:\n... It is correct.\nKarma:\nThen testify about this matter to the court.\nPhoenix:\n(When Edgeworth was telling me about his dream yesterday I noticed something... One detail didn't quite fit. That will be the key... but only if I can get it to work!)\nMaya:\nPlease... Please...\nWitness Testimony\n-- The DL-6 Incident --\nEdgeworth:\nThat day, I had gone to the courtroom to observe one of my father's trials.\nAs we went to leave, an earthquake struck, trapping us in the elevator.\nMy father and Mr. Yogi lost their composure, and began to argue.\nJust then, something heavy fell at my feet.\nI picked it up, and threw it at Mr. Yogi. I wanted them to stop fighting.\nA moment later, there was a single gunshot, then a scream.\nIt was a terrible scream. I remember it to this day.\nThat's all.\nJudge:\nHmm... And, until now, you thought this memory was a \"dream\"?\nEdgeworth:\nWe were stuck in that elevator for five hours. The oxygen in the elevator ran out, and I lost my memory of the events.\nKarma:\nBah! The same claim Mr. Yogi has made!\nJudge:\nVery well. Mr. Wright? Your cross-examination, please.\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.\nCross Examination\n-- The DL-6 Incident --\nEdgeworth:\nThat day, I had gone to the courtroom to observe one of my father's trials.\nEdgeworth:\nAs we went to leave, an earthquake struck, trapping us in the elevator.\nEdgeworth:\nMy father and Mr. Yogi lost their composure, and began to argue.\nEdgeworth:\nJust then, something heavy fell at my feet.\nEdgeworth:\nI picked it up, and threw it at Mr. Yogi. I wanted them to stop fighting.\nEdgeworth:\nA moment later, there was a single gunshot, then a scream.\nEdgeworth:\nIt was a terrible scream. I remember it to this day.\nPhoenix:\n(There it is! One part of the testimony that clearly contradicts the evidence... But I don't know what it means...! I'd better find out, and quick...)\nJudge:\nO-order! Order! Mr. Wright! What are you driving at?\nPhoenix:\nIt's simple, Your Honor. At the time of the incident, two shots were fired. One went into Gregory Edgeworth's heart. The other hit the elevator door. Remember that the defendant lost consciousness after the shot he fired rang out. In conclusion... We must agree that the second shot was fired by someone else!\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Wright! But who could that someone else be!?\nPhoenix:\nThe murderer, of course!\nKarma:\nKarma:\n... I knew I should have stepped in before your wild fantasies got out of hand. Mr. Wright... Look once more at the DL-6 Incident case file. Look closely. Try the \"Case Summary\" page.\nPhoenix:\n(The \"Case Summary\"... that's on page 1.)\nKarma:\nLook what is written there! \"Not a single clue was found on the scene.\"\nPhoenix:\n...!\nKarma:\nIf the pistol had indeed been fired two times... Then the other bullet would have been discovered on the scene!\nJudge:\nHe does have a point.\nKarma:\nThat second bullet has never been found! Why? Because the second bullet does not exist! The bullet that claimed Gregory Edgeworth's life was the one fired by his own son! That is the truth of this matter. The whole truth. It was undoubtedly something else that made that bullet hole in the door.\nJudge:\nOrder! I will have order! ... Mr. Wright has proven one thing to us quite clearly... That the murder weapon was fired twice at the time of the incident. However! As Mr. von Karma says, the second bullet was not found. It is highly unlikely that the police merely overlooked this second bullet. So, all we have is the single bullet fired. I'm afraid I have to discount the defense's claim.\nKarma:\nTsk tsk tsk... I praise the judge for his wisdom in his matter.\nPhoenix:\n(Gah! How did this happen!? I don't believe that the second bullet didn't exist! Was I wrong? Have I been wrong about this whole incident?)\nMaya:\nWhat are you doing, Nick!? Why aren't you raising an objection!?\nPhoenix:\n... I'm sorry, Maya.\nMaya:\nWhat?\nPhoenix:\nI... It looks like I was wrong.\nMaya:\nNick...?\nPhoenix:\nIf the second bullet wasn't there, then all my conjectures are for nothing!\nMaya:\nN-no... But you said you'd do it, Nick! You said you'd get Edgeworth declared innocent!\nPhoenix:\n... I'm sorry... It's just, when I saw the photograph, I thought that two shots had been fired. I was so certain of it. I thought I'd won! I thought there was another person, someone else who fired the killing shot. But now... I was wrong to think it could be that simple. This case has stood unsolved for fifteen years!\nMaya:\nNick...\nJudge:\nWell, it seems that we have finally cleared up this incident. Only one bullet was found at the scene of the crime. That shot was fired by Miles Edgeworth.\nKarma:\nPrecisely.\nJudge:\nI would like to ask one thing of Miles Edgeworth before passing my verdict. Have you been paying attention to the trial so far?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nDo you have any objections?\nEdgeworth:\nNo... No, I do not.\nJudge:\nSo you killed your father, though that was not your intention?\nEdgeworth:\n... Yes, I did.\nMaya:\n... Oh no... He's accepted the guilt... (Changed from [He's confessing...] in the original release) ...\nJudge:\nVery well. The statute of limitations on the murder of Gregory Edgeworth runs out today. Therefore, I must pronounce a verdict on the defendant, right here...\nKarma:\nRight now!\nJudge:\nIndeed. Does anyone have any objections?\nPhoenix:\n(I've been here before... It's just like my first day in court... There are so many things I know I should be saying... But my mind's gone blank, I can't find the words...)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! I... I object!\nKarma:\nTsk tsk tsk. Mr. Wright, on what grounds do you object, hmm?\nPhoenix:\nOof!\nMaya:\nNick...?\nPhoenix:\n(I... I don't know! His case is perfect!)\nMaya:\nOh no...\nPhoenix:\nGrah!\n...it must exist... ...the second bullet...\nPhoenix:\n!!!\nWh-what? What did you just say?\nMaya:\nN-nothing!\nPhoenix:\n(The second bullet must exist? But where!?)\n...someone took it... ([someone] capitalized in the original release)\nJudge:\n... It seems waiting is not going to produce us any answers from Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nWait, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nHmm?\nPhoenix:\nI, uh... Th-the second bullet! It, uh, it existed! (Changed from [Th-the second bullet! It, uh, it exists!] in the original release)\nJudge:\nWhat!? But we've just heard proof that it did not exist!\nPhoenix:\nI-I realize that, Your Honor. (I'm really grasping here!) I-it's just, someone took it from the scene of the crime! That's what happened!\nJudge:\nBut... Who!?\nPhoenix:\nTh-th-the murderer!\nKarma:\nKarma:\nThe murderer? Then tell us, just who is this \"murderer\"?\nPhoenix:\nI'm... still thinking about that one.\nJudge:\nHmm... So the criminal took the second bullet? But why? (Changed from [So the criminal took the second bullet? Why would he?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nJudge:\nFirst of all, how would he have found it? (Changed from [First of all, how would they have found it?] in the original release) It's not easy to find a stray bullet, Mr. Wright! Was there some pressing need for the murderer to search for that bullet?\nPhoenix:\n(Why would the murderer have spent the time to look for that stray bullet...? I haven't got a clue!)\nJudge:\nWhat's wrong, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nUh... Um...\nKarma:\nBah! The murderer had no reason to take that bullet! You don't want to admit it, but it's true!\nPhoenix:\nUrk...\n...had to take it...\nPhoenix:\n(Had to take it...? The murderer? What does that mean?)\n...you're thinking too normal... think crazy... ...don't think why the bullet was taken... ...think why the bullet HAD to be taken...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nY-yes, Your Honor! (I have no idea what I'm doing...) U-uh, well, the murderer had no intention of taking the bullet from the scene. But... uh, the murderer HAD to take that bullet.\nJudge:\n\"Had to,\" Mr. Wright? What do you mean?\nPhoenix:\nWell, for instance... (For instance WHAT!?) Uh, maybe the bullet, uh... hit the murderer?\nJudge:\nThe bullet... hit the murderer?\nPhoenix:\nJ-just saying, for instance. I mean, if it hit you, you would have to take it with you, wouldn't you? It's not like you could perform surgery right there. Y-y'know?\nJudge:\n...\nKarma:\n...\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Wait a second... I was just talking off the top of my head, but what if that's really what happened?)\nJudge:\nLet me get this straight. So at the time of the murder, the murderer themself was shot? (Changed from [So at the time of the murder, the murderer himself was shot?] in the original release) And they left with the second bullet still inside of them!? (Changed from [And he left with the second bullet still inside!? in the original release) Thus leaving only one bullet at the scene of the crime?\nPhoenix:\nUh, yes... I guess that's how it would work, yes.\nJudge:\nBut there's a problem with that! The other two people rescued from that elevator... Miles Edgeworth and Yanni Yogi were both unharmed! So that would mean...\nPhoenix:\nThe murderer came from outside, yes.\nThe two men fight inside the elevator. Trying to stop them, the boy picks up the pistol at his feet and throws it. The pistol discharges, and the bullet... The bullet goes through the elevator door and hits the murderer outside! The boy loses consciousness... Then the murderer opens the elevator door and sees the men inside...\nJudge:\nHmm. Mr. Wright. You are truly the most unpredictable defense attorney I've ever known. I can tell you're grasping, yet I cannot deny the possibility of what you say.\nKarma:\nKarma:\nWhat are you saying! Deny it! Deny it! No one involved with the incident was wounded! There was no \"murderer\"!\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\n(No one was wounded at the time of the incident... He's right. I can't think of anyone...)\nMaya:\nHey, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMaya:\nI just thought of something really crazy.\nPhoenix:\nCrazy?\nMaya:\nRemember what Mr. Grossberg said yesterday?\nGrossberg:\nGregory Edgeworth dealt a blow to his perfect trial record.\nMaya:\nWow.\nGrossberg:\nIt must have been quite a shock for von Karma. He took a vacation for several months after that, you see. Yes, an unusual event for the man. That was the first, and the last vacation he's taken in his many years of prosecuting.\nMaya:\nWhat if von Karma didn't take that vacation because of shock...\nPhoenix:\nBut took it because he was injured!\nMaya:\nWhich would mean...\nPhoenix:\nIt could only mean one thing!\nMaya:\nHe was the murderer in the DL-6 Incident!\nPhoenix:\nHe was the man who shot Gregory Edgeworth!\nMaya:\nIt was... von Karma!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh man!)\nJudge:\nSomething wrong, Mr. Wright? You seem... dazed.\nPhoenix:\nUh, n-no, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nWell? You have indicated the possibility that the murderer came from outside. Can you give us the name of your suspect?\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh. Should I come out and say it now!?)\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! There is a suspect... one lone suspect!\nKarma:\n...\nJudge:\nWell, this is certainly interesting news. Very well, Mr. Wright. Who is your suspect?\nPhoenix:\nV-V-V... (Urk! My h-hands are shaking!)\nJudge:\nV-what?\nPhoenix:\nvon Karma!\nEdgeworth:\nvon Karma!?\nKarma:\n...\nJudge:\n...\n...\nJudge:\nYou mean, THE von Karma? The prosecutor? The one standing right over there? (Changed from [You mean, THE von Karma? The prosecutor? Sitting right there?] in the original release)\nKarma:\nBah.\nJudge:\nYou... don't object?\nKarma:\nHmph. I see no need. Why honor this ridiculous outburst with my objection?\nPhoenix:\nBecause you took a vacation for several months starting the day after the incident! Yet you pride yourself on a perfect record! Why would you take such a long vacation without any reason!?\nKarma:\nSo you're claiming that I took a vacation to heal my \"injury\" from the incident? Fascinating! Prove it. I would have needed surgery, no? Where did I go under the knife at, Mr. Wright!? Bring the doctor that operated on me! Have him testify!\nPhoenix:\nUrk...\nMaya:\nNick! Let's find out who his doctor is!\nEdgeworth:\nIt's no use.\nPhoenix:\nE-Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\nI know von Karma. Perhaps too well. He's perfect. He wouldn't leave clues. He probably didn't undergo surgery. That would leave a doctor as a witness.\nPhoenix:\n(Grr... Nobody's that perfect!)\nMaya:\nSo... so what, Nick? Did von Karma pull the bullet out by himself!? That's insane!\nPhoenix:\nNo... he couldn't have. You can't just pull bullets out of yourself! ... (Wait... What does that mean...? That bullet has to be somewhere! But... where?)\nKarma:\nTsk tsk tsk... Well, Mr. Wright! Can you produce evidence to prove that I was shot?\nPhoenix:\nAlright, von Karma, I'll prove it. And I'll even use evidence... I know how you like it so much.\nKarma:\nWh-what!?\nPhoenix:\nThe evidence that proves von Karma was shot is...!\nPhoenix:\nvon Karma is perfect... He wouldn't risk surgery, leaving an evidence trail. So then, I ask, where is that bullet now? I think it unlikely that von Karma performed surgery on himself!\nJudge:\n...! You... you don't mean!\nPhoenix:\nI do. There is the possibility that the bullet is still inside von Karma!\nJudge:\nI-is that even possible? For all these years!?\nPhoenix:\nWell, there's one way to find out. We could use this metal detector! Well, von Karma? I'm going to run this over you, and see what we find.\nKarma:\nKarma:\n... I... refuse!\nJudge:\nY-you refuse...!? But, refusing this means... You acknowledge that the bullet is still inside you? Order! Order! Order!\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! The defense requests that we be allowed to use the metal detector!\nKarma:\nKarma:\nJudge! I call for a suspension of this trial! This is an invasion of privacy!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThe statute of limitations runs out on this case today! It was you who said we had to end it right here, right now!\nKarma:\nMm... mmmph!\nJudge:\nEnough! I permit the use of the metal detector. Mr. von Karma, you will submit yourself for testing!\nMaya:\nNick! What does this mean...?\nPhoenix:\nI don't know... but we have to give it a shot!\n...*beep* *beep* *beeeeeep*\nPhoenix:\n(It reacted! Something's inside his right shoulder! The bullet!)\nPhoenix:\n... Mr. von Karma...?\nEdgeworth:\n... You! It was you!\nKarma:\n... I was afraid this would happen. And so, I remained silent.\nPhoenix:\n...?\nKarma:\nIndeed, there is a bullet in my shoulder. However... it has nothing to do with this incident!\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nKarma:\nI was shot in the shoulder long before the DL-6 Incident! I claim that the bullet in my shoulder has no relation to DL-6!\nJudge:\nB-but, Mr. von Karma! Can you prove that?\nKarma:\n\"Prove\"? I have no obligation to prove anything! It is Mr. Wright who must prove something here! (Changed from [It is you who must prove something here, Mr. Wright!] in the original release) Not I.\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Wright? Well? Can you prove it? Can you prove that the bullet in von Karma's shoulder was from DL-6?\nKarma:\nOf course he can't! You don't have any of the DL-6 evidence!\nPhoenix:\n(That's because you took it out of the Records Room yesterday!)\nKarma:\nWith no proof, you cannot convict me of any crime! So sorry, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nNo... I'm the one who's sorry, Mr. von Karma.\nKarma:\nWh-what!?\nPhoenix:\nYou were close... one day away from freedom. But, you see... I have proof! (Changed from [You see... I have proof!] in the original release)\nKarma:\nWh-what!?\nPhoenix:\nWho would have thought you would have dug your own grave trying to convict Edgeworth! I can link that bullet in your shoulder to the DL-6 Incident... And here's my final proof!\nJudge:\nTh-that's... A bullet?\nKarma:\nWhere did you get that!?\nPhoenix:\nThis is the bullet used in the DL-6 Incident. This was taken from the heart of the victim, Mr. Gregory Edgeworth. The bullet is preserved quite nicely, with all the ballistic markings intact.\nEdgeworth:\nBallistic markings...\nPhoenix:\nYou may recall the term. It came up in the first trial, two days ago.\nJudge:\nBallistic markings are the fingerprints of a weapon. All bullets fired from a gun are marked with that weapon's unique pattern. By examining the markings, you can tell which weapon fired the bullet. It's quite accurate.\nPhoenix:\nWe have two bullets in our possession. One, the bullet removed from Gregory Edgeworth's heart. The other, Mr. von Karma, is the bullet buried in your shoulder. We could analyze both bullets... Then, if the markings matched... We would know that both bullets had been fired from the same gun! The very same pistol... in other words, the murder weapon that killed Gregory Edgeworth!\nKarma:\nMmmph... mmmph!\nPhoenix:\nMr. von Karma? You will let us remove the bullet from your shoulder. Then we'll compare the ballistic markings to those on this bullet... And solve this case once and for all! Well, Mr. von Karma!?\nKarma:\nMmmrrrrrrgggh! Uuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!\nUaaaaarrrr... aaa...oooh. Worrrrrrrggg... aaa...oooooh...\nEdgeworth:\nThat scream... I've heard that scream before... Wait... I know!\n\"H-help! I can't breathe!\"\n\"Quiet! I said quiet! You're not making this any easier!\"\n\"Stop breathing my air! I'll... I'll stop you! Stop breathing my aaaaair!\"\n(Get away...! Get away from my father!)\n*BANG*\nUuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!\nEdgeworth:\nIt's that scream I heard in the elevator! Fifteen years ago... von Karma! It was you who screamed!\nJudge:\nMr. von Karma?\nKarma:\nWooorrrrrrroooorrgggh Eh...Edgewoooooorrth......... ...Ehh...Edgewoooooorrth...... Only...you would... dare...defy me...!\nEdgeworth:\nSo... it was you!\nKarma:\nYou and your father are my curse! Your father shamed me with a penalty on my record! And you... you left a scar on my shoulder that would never fade! I... I'll bury you! I'll bury you with my bare hands! Death! Death!\nFifteen years earlier...\nKarma:\nChief Prosecutor... I am sorry. (Changed from [Mr. Chief Prosecutor... I am sorry.] in the original release)\nvon Karma! It's not like you to make this kind of error... I never would have thought that Edgeworth would be the one to catch you.\nKarma:\nI... was careless.\nI'm sorry, but you will have to be penalized. I've covered for you in the past, but not this time.\nKarma:\n...! Edgeworth!!!\nIt was a shock like none I had ever known. Me? Penalized!? It took hours for me to regain my composure. Suddenly, I found myself in the darkness... I was in the court records room. I must have wandered in there without thinking where I was going. The room was pitch black. The lights must have gone out. I went out in the hall and felt my way to the elevator. I pressed the button, but nothing happened. (Changed from [I pressed the button, and nothing happened.] in the original release) Then... there was a noise! I was in pain! A horrible, burning pain in my shoulder! Just then, the lights came back on. The elevator door opened before my eyes. I saw three people inside, all lying unconscious from oxygen deprivation. Much to my surprise, a pistol lay at my feet. I knew then... it was destiny. In his last moments, Gregory Edgeworth was still unconscious. He died, never knowing who had shot him. Later, he spoke through a medium, blaming Mr. Yogi. He was fooled! It was the perfect crime!\nKarma:\nTsk tsk tsk... Who would have thought another man would have come to open that elevator door? Judge!\nJudge:\nWh-what?\nKarma:\nWhat are you doing!? Do your job! Bring an end to this miserable charade! Now! End it!\nJudge:\nV-very well.\nJudge:\nIt appears that we have come a very long way to the end of this maze. Fifteen years later...

Did you see his face!? von Karma looked even paler than usual! He's pretending to be all cool, but inside you crushed him, Nick! Crushed! I gotta say, I'm impressed.\nPhoenix:\nHeh... It was pretty close, though. I was sure we'd had it.\nMaya:\nI know, I was on the verge of tears the whole time, myself. But now it's all just a good memory!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nSo, it's finally over, Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\n... Wright.\nPhoenix:\nYeah?\nEdgeworth:\n... I... I'm not sure how to say this.\nMaya:\nI know! I know! Try \"thank you.\"\nEdgeworth:\nI... I see. ... Th-thank you, Wright.\nPhoenix:\nY-you're welcome.\nMaya:\nI think you could have done better than that!\nEdgeworth:\nNngh... S-sorry... I'm not good at this sort of thing. (Changed from [Oof! S-sorry... I'm not good at this sort of thing.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nYou got a lot to learn, Edgeworth!\nPhoenix:\n(She's got you there...) (Changed from [Dear, dear...] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nWhoooooooooooooop! Amazing, pal! You pulled through just like I thought you would! I'll never forget this! I owe you one, pal. And tonight, let's party! Dinner's on me! Yeah, my salary went down again a bit this month... But who cares!\nMaya:\nSee, Mr. Edgeworth? You should take a lesson from Detective Gumshoe! That's how you say \"thank you\"!\nEdgeworth:\nMmm. I... I see. *ahem* Whooooooooooooop! ... I... I feel foolish.\nMaya:\nDon't worry. Take it a little at a time. You'll get used to it.\nPhoenix:\n(It's been fifteen years since I've seen Edgeworth this... unguarded.)\nLotta:\nHey, y'all!\nMaya:\nLotta!\nLotta:\nY'all were great in there!\nPhoenix:\nThank you!\nLotta:\nYo, Edgeworth! Congrats!\nEdgeworth:\nEr... thank y'all very much.\nLotta:\nI knew you were innocent from the start, of course. Just look at you! You wouldn't stick your hand in the cookie jar even if no one was there!\nEdgeworth:\nYou... were the witness on the first day of the trial, weren't you.\nLotta:\nYeah, well, let bygones be bygones, eh?\nPhoenix:\nSpeaking of which, what are you doing now, Lotta?\nLotta:\nWho, me? Aww, I went back to college. I gave up trying to be an investigative photographer pretty quick.\nPhoenix:\nReally? That's too bad.\nLotta:\nHuh?\nPhoenix:\n?\nLotta:\nIsn't that the hotdog guy from the park?\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nButz:\nIt's over, Nick! My life is over!\nPhoenix:\nWh-why the sad face, Larry!? What happened now!?\nButz:\nOh, Nick... I'm not long for this world.\nPhoenix:\nUh... you don't look sick...\nButz:\nIt's Kiyance! Sh-she's goin' to live in Paris! Paris, Nick! She's leaving me behind!!!\nPhoenix:\n(Should've seen that coming...) (Changed from [Larry, Larry...] in the original release)\nButz:\nYo, Edgey! There you are!\nEdgeworth:\nUm, yes, here I am.\nButz:\nCongrats, Edgey! Here... a little gift from me in celebration!\nEdgeworth:\nCelebration? That's unusual for you.\nGumshoe:\nHarry Butz! You come along tonight too! My treat, pal!\nButz:\nHuh? Uh... thanks! Looking forward to it! (Yo, yo, Nick! That's the suit that questioned me! When he says treat... that's not police-talk for prison food, right? Right?)\nPhoenix:\nUh, I think you'll be fine, Larry.\nEdgeworth:\nWright...\nPhoenix:\nYeah? What's up?\nEdgeworth:\nThat envelope that Larry gave me. It's got money in it.\nPhoenix:\nWell, yeah. That's not that strange. People give money away to celebrate sometimes.\nEdgeworth:\nIt's $38.00, Wright.\nPhoenix:\nHuh. What a weird amount. I mean, it's not a little, but it's not a lot either. ... $38.00 exactly?\nMaya:\nN-N-Nick! Wasn't that exactly the amount of lunch money that was stolen from Mr. Edgeworth in school!?\nPhoenix:\n$38...! No... No!!! Larry, it was you!!!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat are you so surprised about, Wright?\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEdgeworth:\nLarry was absent that day from school, right? But that doesn't automatically rule him out as a suspect.\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nEdgeworth:\nThink back to that day, fifteen years ago. Larry took the day off, but he was bored, he came in to school anyway. Then he saw the money lying there... and the rest is history.\nButz:\nI never was good at History! Heh...\nPhoenix:\n... Edgeworth... you didn't know, did you?\nEdgeworth:\nI suspected. I just couldn't picture Larry protecting you like he did that day. Everyone else was saying you did it. The whole class was against you, remember?\nPhoenix:\nYeah... too well.\nEdgeworth:\nWright, you may not know this, but we used to have a saying back in school. \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\"\nPhoenix:\nI know, I know.\nEdgeworth:\nReally, Wright. I'm surprised you didn't figure it out!\nButz:\nWell, this is sure an unexpected turn of events, eh?\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth...\nEdgeworth:\nHmm?\nPhoenix:\nYou should have told me!\nMaya:\nNow, now, Nick. It was fifteen years ago! Don't you think the \"statute of limitations\" has run out, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nI'd say so, yes.\nButz:\nThere you have it!\nPhoenix:\nGrr... Where does that leave me!? I became a defense attorney because of what you two did!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, you have always been something of an insufferable emotionalist. (Changed from [Well, I'd call you a goody-two-shoes to the extreme.] in the original release)\nButz:\nYeah! And you get worked up too easily, too!\nPhoenix:\nD-death! The death sentence for both of you! Man, if only I had known, I'd have become a prosecutor!\nEdgeworth:\nThe same goes for me, only the other way around... For the longest time, I thought that I might have killed my own father. I thought I might be a criminal. I became a prosecutor in part to punish myself. If I had known the truth, I might have become a defense attorney after all.\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth...\nEdgeworth:\nWant to switch, Wright?\nLotta:\nHey, y'all! Line up, I'll take a photo!\nMaya:\nHey, photo time! Let's go!\nGumshoe:\nAnd after that, dinner on me!\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe took us out on the town that night. We celebrated Edgeworth's new found freedom. Even though Edgeworth himself was still in detention. (Changed from [Although, Edgeworth was still in detention.] in the original release)\nDecember 29, 5:02 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nWhoa... I went a little overboard yesterday. My head hurts... Huh? It's still only 5:00. Maybe I should go back to sleep... Hmm? (What's this? A letter?)\nMaya:\nGood morning, Nick. You were really impressive yesterday. Seeing you... It made me think about what I'm doing here. I'm a spirit medium... in training, of course. I wanted to help Mr. Edgeworth too. I wanted to help you. But I couldn't. I was useless. So, I've decided to go back to my training. I'll become a full-fledged spirit medium, for starters. I couldn't say it to your face, so I left this letter. Goodbye, Nick.\nPhoenix:\n(G-goodbye!?) What time is it? Gah! The first trains for the mountains have already left! To the station!\nPhoenix:\n... I guess I'm too late... ...\nMaya:\nHey! N-Nick!\nPhoenix:\nMaya!\nMaya:\n...\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\n...\nPhoenix:\nSo... you're leaving?\nMaya:\nYeah. It's hard being a spirit medium who can't talk to spirits. And... I think you'll do fine without me, Nick. Be good... okay!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nW-wait!\nMaya:\nWhat?\nPhoenix:\n... I never could have saved Edgeworth without your help.\nMaya:\nHuh?\nPhoenix:\nOn the last day of the trial... I heard her. I heard Mia's voice!\nMaya:\nYou heard my sister...?\nPhoenix:\nYes... only her voice, but still... It was at the very end when I thought we'd lost everything.\nMaya:\nWell, that's my sister for you. Detective Gumshoe helped, and Mr. Grossberg, and even Larry... I'm the only one who couldn't help. I was useless, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nBut you were the one who stopped von Karma, Maya!\nMaya:\nHuh? I-I didn't do anything! All I did was wander around in a daze...\nPhoenix:\nSorry, but I have evidence that you helped!\nMaya:\nE-evidence?\nPhoenix:\n(Show Maya some evidence to cheer her up!)\nMaya:\nSo... this is it. (Changed from [So... bye.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nSee you soon, Maya. (Changed from [Bye.] in the original release)\nThanks... Nick.\nAnd so my story ends. Time to turn a new page... and say goodbye to the novice defense attorney that I once was... Now a new story begins... With the same old crazy cast of characters...\nEdgeworth:\nHah! Don't think you've graduated yet, amateur!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. Perhaps you'd like to rethink that claim?\nPhoenix:\nEr... yes, Your Honor. (Uh oh... I got a bad feeling about this...)\nPhoenix:\nGumshoe:\nHey, pal! Mr. Edgeworth came down to the precinct to wish me a happy new year! Talk about a pleasant surprise!\nEdgeworth:\nWhoooooooooooooop! Detective Gumshooooooooooe!\nGumshoe:\nThen he hung his head low and went right back outside. Kind of like he was embarrassed or something. Strange, huh?\nButz:\nHuh? Nick? Nah, haven't seen him lately. Who, me? I've been working at a cheese shop! That's Missy's a nice lady, but she's not exactly what you'd call a \"cheap date\". Huh? Oh, she's in Hawaii right now, yeah...\nPayne:\nWho? Wright? Yeah, I remember him. I hear he's busy lately. You know, not to ring my own bell, but I sort of taught him everything he knows. I'm sure he's grateful.\nBellboy:\nPhoenix Wright...? Hmm... Ah! The defense attorney for whom I wrote that affidavit for, yes! Oh, you should know, I've taken over management for the Gatewater Hotel recently. Should you be in the area, please, stop by...\nGrossberg:\n*Ah-HHHHEM!* Hmm? Oh, it's you. Phoenix Wright? Ah yes, Mia's understudy, was he not? I wonder how he's doing. Haven't seen him of late... \"Ahh... the days of my youth... like the scent of fresh lemon...\" you see.\nOldbag:\nPhoenix Wright...? Is he an actor? (Changed from [Phoenix Wright...? He an actor?] in the original release) Well, I'm not buying it! You can't be a star with a name like \"Phoenix\"! Did you finally know they're putting out some of Hammer's old movies out on DVD in one of them box set thingies that you can buy now-a-days and all not that I know what a \"DVD\" is or why they use three-letter words for just about everything these days how am I supposed to keep it all straight anyhow, hmm?\nWill:\nI'm pleased to announce the Pink Princess is a hit! I sure owe that Mr. Wright a great deal. *sniff* Oh, and I'm keeping my face out of the public eye until the show's over. I wouldn't want to ruin any kids' dreams, you know.\nPenny:\nOh, I got a letter from Maya the other day. It sounds like she caught a cold standing under a waterfall. I wanted to visit, but didn't have time, so I sent her some Pink Princess trading cards. She says she can't buy them where she is. What kind of place is she living at anyway?\nCody:\nWright? Who's that? You wanna talk? Let's talk Pink Princess! Alright! But... you know. I snuck into the studio the other day. And I saw her... the one inside the Pink Princess suit! Ugh! What a dog! It was kind of a shock for a boy of my tender age.\nLotta:\nYeah, I remember Wright! That lawyer guy! Huh, me? I'm in training to become a paranormal photographer! You know that picture I took of everyone? Well, just behind them there's a ghost! For real! Now that's talent! I'm gonna be famous!"

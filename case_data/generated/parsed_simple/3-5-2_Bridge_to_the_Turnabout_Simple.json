Though the branches may appear to be infinite, the choices limitless... ...like our destinies, the sword comes to but one end. One merciless point. And when the silver cord, the fragile thread that binds us to this world, is severed... ...the illusion is revealed and the implacability of fate is finally laid bare...\nFebruary 6, 9:48 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nMaya:\nHey, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nYeah? What is it?\nMaya:\nYou know how I've got spiritual powers, unlike you?\nPhoenix:\nUm, sure... You are a spirit medium, after all.\nMaya:\nBut just like you, if I don't keep my powers sharp, they get dull, right?\nPhoenix:\nUm... I guess so, yeah.\nMaya:\nGlad you agree! OK, Pearly! You're up!\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls...?)\nPearl:\nSo! That's why we need to go on a special \"Spiritual Hot Spot Tour\", Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\n...Huh? I'm lost. What's this magazine you're shoving in my face?\nPearl:\nIt's the New Year's issue of \"Oh! Cult!\", Winter Spiritual Locations Special!\nPhoenix:\n...Oh. (Pearls looks so happy.)\nMaya:\n\"Maximize your spiritual powers with just one night of intensive training!\" ...Oh! It sounds too good to be true!\nPhoenix:\nI'll say. It sounds more like a scam to me.\nMaya:\nIt's at a spiritual retreat called \"Hazakura Temple\". It's way up in the mountains, and I bet it's nice and cold. ...Just perfect for training!\nPhoenix:\n(Now I definitely don't want to go...)\nMaya:\nYou know, I think I've heard of this temple before. It's a famous channeling dojo. It's hard for even real spirit mediums like us to make reservations up there!\nPhoenix:\nReservations...? For a temple? Are you serious?\nPearl:\nDon't worry! I've already made special reservations, just for us!\nMaya:\nYeah! And I signed up for the \"Special Course\"!\nPhoenix:\nTh-That's nice. And the timing couldn't be better. ...Since we don't have a case right now anyway.\nMaya:\nAlrighty then! It's settled! Well, come on! Don't just stand there! Start packing your stuff!\nPearl:\nYes, Mr. Nick! You'd better start packing your stuff!\nPhoenix:\nHuh...? M-ME!? Why do I have to go!?\nMaya:\nWell, we have to be accompanied by someone over 20 years old.\nPhoenix:\nHey! I don't have anything to do with spirit power. The only thing I can channel is a TV. ... So, um, is there a heated pool at this \"Hazakura Temple\"?\nPearl:\nNo, but you can stand under a freezing waterfall!\nPhoenix:\n... Sorry, but I think I'll pass. I hate cold places.\nMaya:\nWhaaat!? No way! How can you be so selfish!?\nPearl:\nCome on, Mr. Nick! Look at this place! Doesn't it look beautiful!?\nPhoenix:\nNope. Not going. I'm gonna be nice and toasty at home....... .................What the...!?\nPearl:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nLet me see that magazine! Th-This nun...\nMaya:\nIs she a friend of yours or something, Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Th-This girl... I-It's...!)\nDahlia:\nMy name is Dahlia Hawthorne. I just want to say... It's an honor for me to be here in your noble presence.\nDahlia:\nHonestly, how can any woman ever count on you for anything? ...You disgust me!\nPhoenix:\nBut... It can't be! (She was found guilty and should still be in prison...)\nPearl:\n...Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n... I'll go.\nMaya:\nHuh...?\nPhoenix:\nHazakura Temple... I said I'll go.\nMaya:\nYay! Isn't that great, Pearly!?\nPearl:\nYes! Oh, thank you! Thank you, Mr. Nick! You'd do anything for Mystic Maya, right? Even walk over burning coals, right!?\n\"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue received from Pearls.\nPhoenix:\n(Dahlia Hawthorne... I knew there was no way she could possibly be at that temple... But, I just had to be see for myself... ...who this \"nun\" really was.)\nFebruary 7, 3:24 PMHazakura TempleMain Gate\nMaya:\nBrrrrr... It-It-It's so c-c-cold here, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nMaybe you should put on something warmer for a change!\nMaya:\nW-W-Well, it's supposed to be c-c-cold... It's t-t-training. ...Ah-Achoo!\nPhoenix:\n(Her teeth are chattering so loudly, it's all I can do to make out what she's saying...)\nPearl:\nWow, Mystic Maya! So this is the famous Hazakura Temple!\nMaya:\nP-P-P-Pearly... I-I-I-I... Ah-Achoo!\n???:\nWell, well, well... How nice to see you here. Welcome to our temple!\nMaya:\nOh...! Th-Th-Thank you... Ah-Achoo!\n???:\nOh my, my, my... Thank you for coming all this way. Come now, come now. You must have been cold.\nPhoenix:\nWhat's with the past tense...? We're freezing into human popsicles as we spea--!\n???:\nHo ho ho. Well, we are high up in the mountains after all. In any case, we shouldn't speak here. ...Please follow me inside.\nMaya:\nTh-Thank you. I was starting to think I would pass--\n???:\nOh! Yes, yes! I almost forgot to introduce myself.\nBikini:\nI'm the head nun here at the temple. My name is Bikini.\nMaya:\nB-B-B-Bikini...!?\nBikini:\nThat's riiight! Actually, that's my \"temple\" name. What do you think? It's a tradition to have one, and I wanted something that has a nice image to it. So I thought, \"Why not choose a bikini?\" Besides, it makes me seem younger. Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho!\nMaya:\nIt certainly does! Oh, I signed up for your \"Special Course\"!\nBikini:\nWell, my, my, my. Quite brave of you considering how cold it is! Young people can be so reckless with their health! Don't blame me if you become one with those you channel. Wa ha ha! Ho ho ho!\nPearl:\nR-Reckless...?\nMaya:\n\"Wa ha ha\"...?\nPearl:\nMaybe you should take it easy tonight, Mystic Maya... We can come back another day.\nMaya:\nBut you went through all that trouble to get reservations for m--\nBikini:\nYes, yes, yes, that's right! You've come all this way, so please, enjoy yourselves! There's still time before supper, so why don't you have a look around?\nFebruary 7Hazakura TempleMain Hall\nMaya:\nBrr... It's fr-freezing in here, too! Achoo!\nPearl:\nHee hee. It reminds me of the Meditation Room in Fey Manor!\nPhoenix:\n...Pearls, you've been in an unusually good mood since we got here.\nPearl:\nWell, kids are made of energy, you know!\nPhoenix:\nAs for you, Maya, you look like you're about to catch a bad cold.\nMaya:\nW-W-Well, I'm not exactly a little kid anymore, I guess. Ah-Achoo!\nPhoenix:\n(Nngh... Is she going to make it...?)\nFebruary 7Suspension Bridge\nMaya:\nWow! Look at this broken down old bridge, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, and look at that big canyon below us.\nMaya:\nHey! There's a river down there! It looks like it's flowing real fast! ...What's wrong, Nick? You look like you've seen a ghost!\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm just not very good with heights...\nMaya:\nOh... Hey! I've got it! Maybe you should face your fear and try hurling yourself off the edge? You know! One... Two... Three... Jump! It might be just what you need to get over your fear of heights!\nPhoenix:\n...Yeah, death is a real good way to overcome phobias alright. Anyway, it sure looks like a rickety bridge.\nMaya:\nCan't argue there. That's probably why it's called, \"Dusty Bridge\".\nPhoenix:\nRead it again, Maya. It says, \"Dusky Bridge\".\nMaya:\nWell, it's practically the same thing.\nAfter clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate:\nFebruary 7Hazakura TempleMain Hall\nMaya:\nTh-Th-The Main Hall... I th-think it's even c-c-c-colder in here! Achoo!\nPearl:\nAh! Mr. Nick! Do you smell that? It smells like meat and gravy!\nMaya:\nYeah, you're right! I guess it's pot roast for tonight! Yum!\nPhoenix:\n...Weird. I thought they would serve something a little more... well, traditional.\nMaya:\nWhat are you talking about, Nick!? You think monks and nuns just sit around eating rice gruel all the time!?\nPearl:\nMystic Maya is right! Ooh! I hope there's mashed potatoes, too! I love mashed potatoes!\n???:\nHa ha ha... What a cute little acolyte! Greetings to all of you.\nPhoenix:\nOh... Um, hello. (Wow, this lady makes Maya look like a 6.8/10 on the weirdness scale.)\nMaya:\nYour outfit... Did you come here for the Special Course, too...?\n???:\nHa, ha, ha... Unfortunately, no. Actually, I'm...\nPearl:\nAaaaaaaaaah! Y-You're...! Y-You're...! You're Ms. Elise Deauxnim!\nElise:\nYes, that's right... You know of me?\nPearl:\nM-M-My name... My name is Pearl Fey! I-I'm your biggest fan!\nMaya:\nWho is she, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nHmm... I see it now... Zvarri! A fortune-teller...?\nPearl:\nI-I've got all your books, Ms. Deauxnim!\nElise:\nHa, ha, ha... What a sweet thing to say. And please, call me Elise.\nPhoenix:\nUm, \"books\"...?\nPearl:\nMr. Nick, don't you know anything!? Don't you even know who this is?\nPhoenix:\nWell, um... ...An author, maybe?\nElise:\nYes, and an illustrator. ...Of picture books.\nMaya:\nPicture books, huh? Oh, now I get it...\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nElise:\nWell, you'll have to excuse me now... I have to go help with the dinner preparations.\nPearl:\nWow! You mean you're cooking dinner tonight?\nElise:\nThat's right. Would you like to help too, Pearl?\nPearl:\nYes, yes! I want to help with whatever I can!\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls looks like she just won the lottery...)\nMaya:\nOh, I'll help too, then...\nElise:\n...No, it's fine. Please don't worry about it. Feel free to relax and explore the area with your friend.\nMaya:\nHuh!? But...\nElise:\n...Oh, yes! Please take this. I think it will be of help to you. It's a map of the area. We wouldn't want you to get lost now, would we?\nPhoenix:\n(The \"Inner Temple\"... There it is, on the other side of the bridge...) Well, if you insist, I guess we'll take this chance to go check out the other temple.\nHazakura Temple Map added to the Court Record.\nPearl:\nOK! I'll see you two later then! Remember! You're not allowed to fight!\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! Let's go! At least we'll stay warm if we keep moving!\nFebruary 7Hazakura TempleMain Gate\nMaya:\nHuh? Where did Sister Bikini go?\nPhoenix:\nI guess she went to the Inner Temple... To go help that other nun out.\nMaya:\nOh, right... I think her name is... Iris?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah... That was it. (I want to find out who Iris really is, but I'm scared of what I'll find...)\nMaya:\n...?\nFebruary 7Inner Temple Gate\nMaya:\nWhoa, that bridge was shaking like jello in an earthquake.\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nAnd at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I bet. (Changed from [And at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I'd bet.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nNot to mention the last part only had like one board left on it!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nWhat's wrong with you? Your face is all green.\nPhoenix:\nC-Can you not pick on me for a second? I'm still trying to get over the shock that we made it safely across that death trap.\nMaya:\nYeah, I guess I'm a bit surprised, too... Yikes! That \"temple\" is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse at any time... (Changed from [Yikes! That 'temple' is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse anytime...] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nI guess people don't use it too often. Is this really where you're going to train tonight?\nMaya:\nThat has to be it. It's kinda creepy around here... Like a ghost might jump out at you or something!\nPhoenix:\n(A spirit medium afraid of ghosts...? Isn't it ironic, don't you think?)\nFebruary 7Inner TempleTraining Hall\nPhoenix:\nMan, look at this place... It's just a tiny, freezing-cold room. So this is where you'll both be training, huh...\nMaya:\nHuh? What do you mean, \"both\"? I'm the only one.\nPhoenix:\nReally? But I thought...\nMaya:\nPearly's just a little kid. She couldn't handle this kind of intense training.\nPhoenix:\n(So says the girl who I can barely hear over her teeth chattering...) (Changed from [So says the girl who I can barely hear over her bones chattering...] in the original release)\nMaya:\nAnyway... The real training room must be behind that door over there. Hmm... Yup, definitely getting the feeling it's back there. (Changed from [Yeah, I get the feeling it's back there, definitely.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Even I can sense that there's something supernatural about the cavern behind that door...) (Changed from [If only because the cavern behind that door is giving off a real supernatural feel...] in the original release)\n???:\nUm... Excuse me, but... Who are you...? ...Ah! ...\nPhoenix:\nY-You're...\nMaya:\nHi there! We're just looking around since we're going to be staying here tonight...\n???:\n...\nMaya:\n...? Is something wrong?\n???:\nUh, er, no! It-It's nothing...\nMaya:\nI wonder why she spaced out like that. Don't you, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nUh... D-Did you say something, M-Maya?\nMaya:\n... Not you too, Nick...\nIris:\nI... M-My name is Iris. I'm one of the nuns here at this temple.\nMaya:\nI'm Maya Fey. It's a pleasure to meet you!\nIris:\nThe pleasure is mine... ... Oh, er, please excuse me! I have some... um, chores to attend to.\nMaya:\nShe sure is beautiful... and a bit spacey, I guess... I guess she's just not used to talking with urban sophisticates like us.\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nNick?\nPhoenix:\n(That girl... It-It can't be, but...)\nMaya:\n...?\nAfter examining hanging scroll in Inner Temple - Training Hall:\nFebruary 7Dusky Bridge\nMaya:\nWhew, we managed to make it across Dusty Bridge.\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nNick, you look green. Are you feeling alright?\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nHey! What's wrong with you? Ever since we met Sister Iris at the Training Hall, you've been really quiet.\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? Oh, um. Sorry...\n???:\nHey, you! ...Wait up!\nMaya:\n...? You think he's yelling at us?\nPhoenix:\nHe must be. There's no one else around...\n???:\nWould you mind moving? You're standing right in my way. ... Ah!\nMaya:\nHey! I know you! You're...\n???:\nWhoa! Sorry! Gotta run! ...See ya!\nPhoenix:\nH-Hey! Wait a minute!\n???:\nOh, uh, nice to meet you. ...I'm Laurice Deauxnim.\nPhoenix:\nLiar! You're Larry! Your clothes may change, but you're still the Butz.\nButz:\nShaddup! I'm... I'm... Lauriiiiice! And I'm just here to do a sketch of Dusky Bridge!\nMaya:\nSo... it really is our Larry. ...Not that I get why he's pretending to be someone else.\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Iris profile:\nPearl:\nEveryone!\nMaya:\nHey! Pearly!\nPearl:\nDinner preparations are complete! Please come quickly to the Main Hall!\nMaya:\nAlright! I can't wait to dig in, Pearly!\nPearl:\nI'm going to go to the Inner Temple and call Sister Iris! I also want to have a look at where Mystic Maya is going to be training...\nFebruary 7, 7:46 PMHazakura TempleMain Hall\nMaya:\nBoy am I stuffed...\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure it's alright to eat that much before your training?\nMaya:\nWell, this kind of training is a battle of endurance.\nPearl:\nMystic Maya... Please don't do anything that might put your health at risk.\nMaya:\nHa ha ha. No pain, no gain, I guess.\nPearl:\nNngh... I'm still worried about you...\nBikini:\nWell, well, well. Let's not dilly-dally shilly-shally. You must get ready for tonight.\nElise:\nGood luck. ...Maya.\nMaya:\nAlright! Here I go! I'll see you all tomorrow, I guess!\nBikini:\nIris, please ring the bell at 10:00 for lights out, alright?\nIris:\nYes, Sister Bikini.\nBikini:\nAnd then, after you ring the bell, I want you to come join us at the Training Hall.\nIris:\nI understand, Sister Bikini.\nPhoenix:\n(Maya and Bikini really seem excited about this training thing tonight...)\nElise:\n...Well, Pearl? What are you going to do tonight?\nPearl:\nWell, umm...\nElise:\nIf you'd like, you can come to my room. Perhaps we can read some books together.\nPearl:\nR-Really!? I'd love to! I, umm... I'm not very good at reading.\nElise:\nHa ha ha. Well then, would you like to practice reading with me?\nPearl:\nAh! I'd love to!\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls is absolutely smitten with Ms. Deauxnim...) So Larry, what are you going to do?\nButz:\nHuh... Me? Um, well... I'm just gonna hang out in my room. I can't stand the cold at all.\nPhoenix:\n(I totally hear you there.)\nPearl:\nUm, Ms. Elise? So, for example, how do you read this?\nElise:\nIt says, \"gravely\"... That's kind of a tough word.\nPearl:\nOh! OK! And what about this word?\nElise:\nThat's another tough one. It says, \"roast\".\nPhoenix:\n(What kind of a book is she reading anyway...?)\nPearl:\nWell, I'm going to go wash the dishes and help clean up. I'll go visit you when I'm done, Ms. Elise!\nPhoenix:\n(Well, not much to do except head to my room and huddle under the covers, I guess...)\nFebruary 7, 9:12 PMHazakura TempleMain Hall\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh... It's a whole different type of cold up here in the mountains! Argh... Why couldn't the nearest bathroom be just a little closer to my room...?)\n???:\n...Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nYaaaaaaah! Oh! Ah, Ms. Deauxnim! Are you going to use the bathroom, too?\nElise:\nUm, no. But... Have you seen Pearl?\nPhoenix:\nNo... Not since after dinner. I thought she said she was going to go to your room...\nElise:\nI know... But she never showed up. I-I'm going to go look for her. ...Excuse me.\nPhoenix:\n(Ms. Elise Deauxnim... A woman as mysterious in origin as her last name... But... The really mysterious one is...)\nIris:\nOh...\nPhoenix:\nAh...! S-Sister Iris...!\nIris:\nG... G-Good evening...\nPhoenix:\n(The real mysterious one is this girl...!)\nIris:\nUm, are you on your way to the bathroom too, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(...I can't let this chance pass me by! I should try to talk with her... And maybe get some answers.)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nIris:\nAh...\nPhoenix:\nIs something wrong?\nIris:\nI-I didn't realize it was so late. I have to go and ring the bell for lights out...\nPhoenix:\n(I guess it's almost 10:00 now, huh?)\nIris:\n... Um... Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\n...Yes?\nIris:\nIf it's alright with you... I would like you to have this.\nPhoenix:\nBut this is your hood...\nIris:\nIt has the power to protect you from evil spirits.\nPhoenix:\n(Come to think of it, Sister Bikini was wearing one of these, too...)\nIris:\nI pray for your safety on this dark, cold night.\nIris's Hood received from Iris.\nIris:\nI'm sorry, but I must bid you goodnight.\nPhoenix:\nWait a minute, Sister Iris...\nIris:\nY-Yes...?\nPhoenix:\nJust now, you called me by my name... You said, \"Mr. Wright\". How did you know my name? I never introduced myself to you.\nIris:\nTh-That's...\nPhoenix:\n...Sister Iris. Please, tell me the truth. You and I... Have we ever met before?\nIris:\n...\n5 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPhoenix:\nI-Iris...\nIris:\nO-Oh! It-It's almost 10:00... Perhaps we can speak again... tomorrow.\n*gong* *gong* *gong*\nPhoenix:\n(So my hunch was correct... She does know me... I'll have to try to talk with her again tomorrow... ......... ...... ...)\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! (Changed from [YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Wh-What the...!? That blood-curdling scream came from the courtyard!)\nFebruary 7, 11:06 PMHazakura TempleCourtyard\nPhoenix:\n(That scream... I'm sure it came from around here...) ...Aaaah! (S-Someone's there... On the ground...!) M-Ms. Deauxniiiiiim!\n...*squish*\nPhoenix:\n(...I just stepped on something soft.)\nBikini:\nHey! Don't step on my tummy like that!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What are you doing lying there in the snow!?\nBikini:\nI was passed out! What do you think!?\nPhoenix:\nSo that blood-curdling scream was you...?\nBikini:\nF-Forget about that! H-Hurry up and call the police!\nPhoenix:\nIs there even a phone in the Main Hall?\nBikini:\nNo, but we still get reception up here in the mountains! You must have a cell phone on you, right!?\nPhoenix:\nI, um... I didn't bring it with me--\nBikini:\nOh, you're useless! I mean, even Iris has a cell phone... We've got no choice! You'll have to use the public phone by Dusky Bridge! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Run as fast as you can!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, ma'am...\nBikini:\nIf you don't hurry, Iris will... Iris will...!\nFebruary 7, 11:18 PMDusky Bridge\nPhoenix:\n...*huff*...*huff*... (It's farther than I thought. The bridge is just up ahead. I have to go tell Maya what happened, too!) ............ ...Aaaaaaaaaah! Dusky Bridge...! It's burning down! (What the heck happened!?)\nButz:\nWhat are you doing here?\nPhoenix:\nAaaaaaaaah!\nButz:\nHuh? What is it? Is it me?\nPhoenix:\nD-Don't scare me like that, Larry! I almost had a heart attack!\nButz:\nMy name isn't Larry! It's Laurice!\nPhoenix:\nLarry, hurry up and call the police! I'm going to the Inner Temple!\nButz:\nD-Don't be stupid! The bridge is nothing but a burning wreck right now!\nPhoenix:\nListen to me! There's been a murder! Here! At Hazakura Temple!\nButz:\nWha-Whaaaaat!?\nPhoenix:\nThe murderer might have fled across the bridge! I have to make sure Maya is safe!\nButz:\nB-B-But...\nPhoenix:\nPlease! Call the police! I've got to go! ...Get outta my way, Larry!\nButz:\nIt-It's too dangerous! Nick, w-wait!\nPhoenix:\n(I must have been crazy... I knew how dangerous it was, but I still went for it...)\n...*crack!*...\nPhoenix:\nAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!\nButz:\nNiiiiiick----!\nPhoenix:\n(Weakened even more by the fire, the rickety old bridge's planks snapped and gave way. And as I was swallowed by the eternal darkness that surrounded me... ...a final, terrified scream rose up to pierce the frozen air of that harrowing night.)\nTo be continued.\nDate: ???

It's an emergency!\nEdgeworth:\n...Huh? Larry...? Do you know what time it is?\nButz:\nIt's not \"Larry\"! It's \"Laurice\"! Laurice Deauxnim!\nEdgeworth:\n(... This is nothing more than a terrible nightmare... I'll just roll over and...)\nButz:\nW-Wait! Don't hang up! ...It's an emergency! It's Nick! H-He... He took a really nasty spill!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, it wouldn't be the first time, so...\nButz:\nI'm not joking! His life is in danger!\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What...!? What happened!? Tell me!\nButz:\nTalk about a guy with bad luck! He may already be dead! Anyway, you've got to come back! You're the only one that can help! My Iris... My beautiful Iris! She needs help...!\nEdgeworth:\nAlright. I don't know what's going on, but... I'll be there as soon as I can.\nButz:\nI-I'm at the detention center! Please! Hurryyyyyy!\nPhone:\n...*beep*...\nEdgeworth:\n(It's been one year since I left that country... I thought I wouldn't have to see him again for a while... Sounds like it won't be a pretty reunion... As if I expected anything to change.)\nFebruary 8, 2:19 PMDetention CenterVisitor's Room\nButz:\nYou're late, Edgey! What took you so long!?\nEdgeworth:\nI don't want to hear it! I chartered a private jet to come as quickly as I could!\nButz:\nWell, you should've chartered a faster one! Anyway, just listen! Something happened to Ms. Elise... and Nick is... Maya... and Iris's Bikini... ...Huh? Say something, Edgey!\nEdgeworth:\n...Before I came here, I stopped in at the hospital where Wright is. I believe I have a better understanding of the situation than you, at this point. The murder victim was the picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. She was found by Wright and the head nun. The suspect is the temple's younger nun. Then later, while Wright was crossing the bridge, it broke and he fell into the river. The hospital says that he'll need at least 2 days of bed rest.\nButz:\nY-Yes! Th-That's right! You got it! B-But they arrested her... My sweet little Iris!\nEdgeworth:\n(And here I was, convinced HE was the one the police had arrested...) However... I still don't understand what these two items are for.\nButz:\nWhat are you talking about?\nEdgeworth:\nThey're things Wright gave to me when I was leaving his room. (This is the first... He said some nonsense about being able to see into people's hearts with this... And the other... He couldn't possibly be asking what I think he is... could he?)\nButz:\nI'm begging you! Iris's trial starts tomorrow! With Nick out of the picture, you're all I've got left! You're the only one that can represent her!\nEdgeworth:\n... What did you just say?\nButz:\nYou know! REPRESENT! DEFEND! What were you expecting!? Why do you think I called you anyway!?\nEdgeworth:\n...I'm a prosecutor, Larry. A prosecutor. Do YOU understand what I'm saying? A prosecutor is a lawyer who...\nButz:\nDon't talk to me like a kid! I graduated from junior high, you know! Don't worry about it! I promise I won't tell!\nEdgeworth:\nBut I...\nButz:\nI mean, I heard a paper badge had no problem fooling an entire court before!\nEdgeworth:\n(...How could this country's judicial system have fallen into such decay!?)\nButz:\nPlease, Edgey! At least listen to her... Listen to Iris's side of the story!\nEdgeworth:\n(So Wright wasn't joking when he gave me this badge after all...)\nIris:\nThank you for coming. ...My name is Iris.\nEdgeworth:\n...Edgeworth. Miles Edgeworth. I don't know if I can be of any help, but... ...I will at least hear what you have to say. ...About the murder.\nIris:\nUm...\nEdgeworth:\n...?\nIris:\nM-Mr. Wright! H-H-How is he? Mr. Laurice said that he... That he might even die...\nEdgeworth:\n... Fortunately, he will be fine. (Larry, you moron! How could you say something like that!?) He was badly bruised when he hit the water, but otherwise he is unharmed.\nIris:\n... Thank goodness...\nEdgeworth:\nBut, he's caught some kind of nasty cold.\nIris:\nA cold...?\nEdgeworth:\nHe's running a high fever and is drifting in and out of consciousness.\nIris:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n(I must be imagining things. This woman... I feel like I've met her before...)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... It appears that's about all that you can tell me.\nIris:\nThank you very much for listening to my story.\nEdgeworth:\n...I visited Wright at the hospital before coming here. He asked me to take care of you...\nIris:\n...M-Me?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, at the trial tomorrow... He asked me to defend you.\nIris:\n... If Mr. Wright has that much faith in you, Mr. Edgeworth... ...Then I will gladly entrust my fate in your capable hands.\nEdgeworth:\nBut before that, I have one question.\nIris:\nYes?\nEdgeworth:\nDo you know Wright?\nIris:\nEr... Wh-Why would you ask that?\nEdgeworth:\nWhenever you came up in our conversation, he would begin to act a little... strange.\nIris:\n... Mr. Edgeworth... What is Mr. Wright to you? (Changed from [Mr. Edgeworth... Are you his friend?] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\n...He is a very dear and indispensable friend. (Changed from [Friend? Well... In a sense, yes.] in the original release)\nIris:\n... It was 5 years ago... That's when I... That's when I... deceived him.\nEdgeworth:\nYou \"deceived\" him...?\nIris:\nI heard that he was... in a lot of pain after what happened. I know what a weak person I am. That's why... That's why I thought it was best if he never saw me again. I wanted him to just forget about me, without learning the truth.\nEdgeworth:\n... Well, if you ask me, Wright is still suffering... And until he learns the truth, I don't think he will ever be able to truly recover. ...Iris. It's not too late. You should go to him. ...Tell him the truth.\nIris:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nI'll defend you, but only if you agree to that one condition.\nIris:\n... Alright, Mr. Edgeworth... I promise.\nEdgeworth:\n...Very well. I'll do everything in my power to get you an acquittal. (That's enough information gathering for now. I should head to the crime scene...)\nFebruary 8Dusky Bridge\nEdgeworth:\n(It sure is cold alright... So this is it... Dusky Bridge...)\n???:\nOh, wow! It's you, Mr. Edgeworth! (Changed from [Ahem! M-Mr. Edgeworth!] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\nNngh... Detective Gumshoe. (Changed from [Urk... Detective Gumshoe.] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nLong time no see! It's been about a year? ...Or has it been longer?\nEdgeworth:\nIt doesn't matter, Detective. What does matter is why you're shuffling around up here.\nGumshoe:\nOh, ouch! ...And there's that sharp left jab! (Changed from [Oh, ouch! ...And there was a sharp left jab!] in the original release) Well, I'm happy to see you anyway, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nLet me guess... You were transferred by HR to the local precinct? (Changed from [Let me guess... You were transferred into another section at work.] in the original release) A wise decision. The vast amount of nothing up here should be quite easy to guard. (Changed from [A good choice. The vast amount of nothing up here must be quite easy to guard.] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nI heard you were back in the country and arranged to come all the way out here! Everybody was real nice. They even let me take charge of the investigation, sir.\nEdgeworth:\n(...Gumshoe indeed! Like gum on your shoe, he's impossible to get rid of!)\nGumshoe:\nI'm supposed to report on the details of the crime scene, sir! Anyway! Here I am! Detective Dick Gumshoe! Reporting for duty!\nEdgeworth:\n...Great. Um, thank you, Detective.\nGumshoe:\nI thought Prosecutor Godot was gonna get here before me. That guy's a real mystery, I tell you!\nEdgeworth:\n(...Prosecutor Godot?)\nFebruary 8Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nEdgeworth:\n(It looks like Iris is being interrogated right now.) ...This place certainly brings back memories.\nGumshoe:\nOh yeah. Come to think of it, you got thrown in here once too, didn't you, sir? But you know what? I've never been in jail a single time!\nEdgeworth:\n(I should think it's hard to land in jail when you're so harmless...) Yes, well... If you're in jail, you don't have to pay for your own meals, you know.\nGumshoe:\n...*gasp!* ...\nEdgeworth:\nDon't get any funny ideas, Detective...!\nGumshoe:\n...Too late, I already did.\nEdgeworth:\n(In any case... I guess I'll have to come back here later...)\nFebruary 8Hazakura TempleMain Gate\nButz:\nYo! Edgey! What took you so long!? I'm so cold, my brain's turned to sherbet.\nEdgeworth:\n...I knew it was a mistake to race back to this country.\nButz:\nWh-What do you mean...?\nEdgeworth:\nWright is going to be fine, and the case itself isn't anything unusual... And I find myself taking a request to defend a woman accused of murder!\nGumshoe:\n...H-Hey! Wait a sec! Hold it! Objection! What's going on here, Mr. Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\nUm, it's hard to explain, but one thing led to another and...\nButz:\nWhat kind of lame excuse is that!? And you call yourself a defense attorney!?\nGumshoe:\nProsecutor Edgeworth is a prosecutor, and that's why he's Prosecutor Edgeworth! \"Prosecutor Edgeworth, Defense Attorney\" just sounds plain old weird, pal! ...Right, Prosecutor Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\n(...I'm not sure what role I'm supposed to be playing anymore.)\nButz:\nHmph! Dude, Edgey... (Changed from [Hmph! Dude, Edgey... I don't see you for a couple of years...] in the original release) I don't see you for a couple of years, and your heart turns to sherbet! (Changed from [...and your heart turns to sherbet!] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\n...I'd say more like sorbet. It is rather cold here.\nButz:\nIris didn't murder her! Someone else did it! I just know it, OK!? So trust me on this one!\nEdgeworth:\nEver the romantic, aren't you, Larry? Nevertheless, I'll do whatever I can to prove her innocence. (At least until I pass the baton on to Wright, that is.)\nFebruary 8Hazakura TempleMain Hall\nBikini:\n*sigh*\nGumshoe:\nHey! Hello there! Um, so how are you feeling?\nBikini:\nAlright, I suppose. ...Huh? Who is this?\nEdgeworth:\nI... My name is... Miles Edgeworth.\nBikini:\nMy my my. A handsome boy such as yourself is always welcome! *sigh* If circumstances weren't so tragic, I might just...\nEdgeworth:\n(Please don't call me \"boy\".) I'm sorry to trouble you... But I'm looking for a woman in a bikini.\nBikini:\nWell, you have found her. Now, what can I do for you?\nEdgeworth:\n... I'm sorry, but I don't see any bikinis...\nBikini:\nHa ha ha! If you ask nicely, I might give you a peek, big boy. Wa ha ha ho ho ho!\nGumshoe:\nUmm... Mr. Edgeworth? This is the head nun, Sister Bikini... She's the witness.\nEdgeworth:\n... Why didn't you tell me that earlier!? This is exactly why your salary keeps on getting cut!\nGumshoe:\nNngh... My stomach is already growling in protest...\nBikini:\nSo... Um... What's the latest about my beloved Iris!?\nEdgeworth:\nWell, first... I want to hear what you know.\nMain Gate (before clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate)\nAfter clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple  - Main Gate:\nFebruary 8Hazakura TempleMain Gate\nEdgeworth:\n...Hmm.

What a thorn in my side.)\nFebruary 8Hazakura TempleCourtyard\nGumshoe:\nAnd this is where the murder took place, sir! Other than removing the body, we left everything else untouched!\nEdgeworth:\nThanks, Detective. I'll just have a look around. (It looks like the police are still investigating...)\nGumshoe:\nOh yeah, by the way... I thought I'd better ask, just to be sure... Are you really gonna defend that nun, Iris, at the trial tomorrow?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitment. (Changed from [Yes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitments.] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nWell, in that case... I've gotta be careful... Gotta make sure I don't leak the prosecution's whole investigation...\nEdgeworth:\nDon't worry about it, Detective. Just keep your mouth closed and I think most of it will flow out on its own.\nGumshoe:\n... You got it, sir! I'll make sure it flows out like water from a tap! (Changed from [Roger, sir! I know exactly what you're saying!] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\nY-Yes, you do that, Detective. (Just how much has your runny spout leaked over the years?)

It's still better than the view from my apartment, though.\nEdgeworth:\nTsk! Someone's here! Hide yourself, Detective!\n???:\nOh! Why why why!? Why does this always happen!?\nButz:\nWhenever I find a girl I like, they always run away! I even chased one of them to Japan... Next it's going to be prison, I guess. (Changed from [I even chased one of them to Tibet... Next it's going to be prison, I guess.] in the original release) ...I'll steal that detective's wallet. That'll get me locked up for sure. ...Nah. I can't do that to someone who looks like he's down on his luck.\nGumshoe:\n...He's just talking to himself.\nEdgeworth:\nShh! Be quiet and listen!\nButz:\nI knew it... I shouldn't have done that!

Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n...Yes?\nIris:\nYou are a prosecutor... aren't you? Are you sure about this? If your true identity is revealed...\nEdgeworth:\nDon't worry.

(Changed from [Y-You have...?] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\n...Iris. It is a prosecutor's job to doubt people.\nIris:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nBut right now... I am a defense attorney.

However, the same cannot be said for the prosecution in this case.\nEdgeworth:\n...Indeed.\nJudge:\nI'm not sure I like such blatant waste of this court's time. An empty prosecutor's chair can only mean... ...that the prosecutor has no confidence in their ability to prove their case. It would seem this case is already over before it had a chance to begin. I am ready to announce my verdict at this time. This court finds the defendant...\n???:\n???:\nThe prosecution... stands ready.\nJudge:\nA-And you are...?\nvon Karma:\nFranziska von Karma... Prosecuting prodigy.\nJudge:\nV-Von Karma, you say...? Perchance, you wouldn't be of any relation to the legendary prosecutor Manfred von Karma?\nvon Karma:\n... Legends are a thing of the past. I am a Von Karma. That is all. Upon a special request, I flew in today for the purposes of prosecuting this case.\nJudge:\nY-You did!? Then... you must be quite a big shot, eh! By the way, Mr. Edgeworth...\nEdgeworth:\nYes, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nI'm almost certain that I've seen you somewhere before. Or am I just imagining things? You look very much like a prosecutor I met once...\nEdgeworth:\n...I believe you are imagining things, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nMs. von Karma? Do you have anything to say?\nvon Karma:\n... There is no such weakling as this man among those of the Prosecutor's Office.\nJudge:\nThere... there isn't...? But I'm sure... once before, in this courtroom... Ack!\nvon Karma:\n...I told you, there is no such weakling!\nJudge:\nWh-What is that!? A whip!? I'm not sure I care for such a thing in my courtroom! B-Bailiff! Remove that whip, at...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\n...I have no objection to the whip.\nJudge:\nY-You don't...?\nEdgeworth:\nThe prosecution can wield a whip or drink seventeen cups of coffee... But there is still only one truth. That is what I stand here to prove today!\nvon Karma:\nThis promises to be interesting... Miles Edgeworth. ...I had expected to face Phoenix Wright here today. But looking at you now... ...maybe this is what I have been waiting for all this time. Miles Edgeworth! I will not allow this chance to crush you slip through my fingers!\nEdgeworth:\n...I see you brought your flair for the histrionic.\nJudge:\nAllow me to add to the things I'm not sure about... People acting bizarrely in my court! Uwa-hah!\nvon Karma:\n...The stage is set. Now continue with the proceedings, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nVery well. Ms. von Karma, please give an outline of this case. With as little whipping as possible!\nvon Karma:\nThe murder victim is the famed picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Her body was found in the Hazakura Temple courtyard. She had been stabbed through the torso by a ceremonial sword from a golden statue.\nJudge:\nThe sword in this picture... is the weapon in question, correct...? ...Very well. The court accepts this photo of the crime scene.\nCrime Photo added to the Court Record.\nvon Karma:\nThere is no mistake. This was the doing of Sister Iris. After all... there is a witness to her crime.\nJudge:\n...Very well. Please bring this witness to the stand!\nEdgeworth:\n(And so it begins... My first and my last trial... as a defense attorney!)\nvon Karma:\n...Witness. State your name and occupation. Please.\nJudge:\nH-Hold on here! I'm not sure about being not sure if I care for this at all! Witness! Please stand up nice and straight!\nEdgeworth:\nIf I recall correctly... ...there are a few milk crates in the Defendant's Lobby for our back pain-plagued witness. (Changed from [...there are a few milk crates in the defendant's lobby for witnesses with bad backs.] in the original release)\nJudge:\nBailiff! Fetch a crate for this poor lady, please!\nvon Karma:\n...Once again. Your name and occupation, please.\nBikini:\nLittle old me? Well, I'm the head nun of Hazakura Temple on Eagle Mountain. My name is Bikini. You got it? Bikini. Nice to meet everyone.\nJudge:\n... But you don't appear to be wearing a bikini right now... Uwah!\nvon Karma:\n...The courtroom is the garden of holy judgment. Those with lechery in their hearts should leave this sanctuary at once!\nJudge:\nY-You want me to leave!?\nBikini:\nNo need to get your bikinis in a twist! Let me tell you, I'm a sight to behold in summer! Wha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha!\nEdgeworth:\nIn any case... Witness. I hear that you saw the crime take place on the night in question.\nBikini:\nThat's right! I can still hardly believe it myself, to be honest. There's no way dear little Iris could do anything like that...\nJudge:\nLet us hear what you have to say then. First, tell us aboot your own movements that night, eh!\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Night of the Murder --\nBikini:\nThat night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But...\nWell, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently.\nSo, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.\nThere's no bath at the Inner Temple, you see, and I needed a long, hot soak.\nIt was after I had finished, just as I was heading back... that's when I saw it!\nJudge:\nHmm... So it was simply coincidence that you found yourself returning to Hazakura Temple?\nBikini:\n...Yes, you could say that. If my back hadn't been in so much pain, I would have stayed at the Inner Temple.\nEdgeworth:\n(That sounds like a pretty important statement she just made...)\nvon Karma:\nThere is only one problem with this testimony that I can see... And you're not about to fall at the first hurdle, now are you, Miles Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n...\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth. ...Please begin your cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- The Night of the Murder --\nBikini:\nThat night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But...\nBikini:\nWell, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently.\nBikini:\nSo, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.\nBikini:\nIris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner.\nBikini:\nThere's no bath at the Inner Temple, you see, and I needed a long, hot soak.\nBikini:\nIt was after I had finished, just as I was heading back... that's when I saw it!\nEdgeworth:\n(There is indeed only one problem with this testimony. If I can clearly point out what it is, then I can begin to quantify... ...just how good this witness's memory and observation skills are.)\nEdgeworth:\n...Witness. Let's get one thing straight. The defendant whom you claim to have met... ...she was wearing this \"Demon-Warding Hood\", correct?\nBikini:\nOf course! That is a very important piece of clothing, I'll have you know! Wha ha ha! Wha ha ha! Ha ha... Wait a minute...\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nH-Hold it right there! Why do you have that...!?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's the question of the day, now isn't it... Ms. von Karma? I'll have you know that this hood was given to someone as a gift that night. Before the lights out bell was rung.\nvon Karma:\nW... What!?\nEdgeworth:\n...You know where I'm going with this, don't you? If the witness had seen the defendant as she claims... ...then the Iris she saw should have been missing this very hood! (Changed from [...the defendant couldn't have been wearing this very hood!] in the original release)\nBikini:\nWell well well!\nEdgeworth:\n(It's not a bad feeling at all, exposing contradictions like this... Now I understand that happy look on Wright's face every time he does it...)\nJudge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Witness, your response... Wuahaaa!\nvon Karma:\n...Sister. This hood... You have spare ones around the temple, don't you?\nBikini:\nSpares... Well... I do tend to make too many of them.\nJudge:\nI see... A stockpile. A surplus of hoods, eh?\nBikini:\nEach nun is only given one hood. This should be the only hood that Iris owned...\nJudge:\nHmm... Then this is quite strange! Waaaah!\nvon Karma:\nIf there was a surplus of hoods, then she could have worn one of those! ...There is no contradiction here!\nJudge:\nHmm...\nEdgeworth:\n(I'm sorry to break this to you, Ms. von Karma... but you won't get away that easily. Discrepancies such as this will sow seeds in any human heart. The seeds of doubt.)\nJudge:\n...Witness. While I don't wish to call your testimony into doubt... ...you must give every detail with precision.\nBikini:\nI-I'm not sure I'm comfortable going along with this...\nvon Karma:\nSister. You shall continue with your testimony. Tell us what you saw after finishing your bath, on your way back to the Inner Temple!\nEdgeworth:\n(Those seeds of doubt are sprouting in the judge's heart. They just need a little more stimulation to bear fruit... Contradictory stimulation.)\nWitness Testimony\n-- After My Bath --\nBikini:\nI finished my bath around 11, and I thought I should return to the Inner Temple.\nAnd as I was walking back... I heard a noise from the courtyard. I took a look and...\nIris was...! Oh, Mystic Elise! And with that sword, of all things!\nMystic Elise was staying in the corner room, which faces out onto the courtyard.\nThe stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window.\nJudge:\nYou saw a truly terrible sight, didn't you...? If I was in your place... ...then it would be much like Ms. von Karma whipping Mr. Edgeworth in two in court! And me, seeing it all from this very chair! ...Er, well, something like that.\nEdgeworth:\n(This judge... His imagination is about as vivid and creative as Detective Gumshoe...)\nvon Karma:\nI would look the fool if I commented on such foolishness. Anyway, this case is mine... Miles Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nCalling everyone by their full name... Can't you do something about that habit of yours?\nCross Examination\n-- After My Bath --\nBikini:\nI finished my bath around 11, and I thought I should return to the Inner Temple.\nBikini:\nAnd as I was walking back... I heard a noise from the courtyard. I took a look and...\nBikini:\nIris was...! Oh, Mystic Elise! And with that sword, of all things!\nBikini:\nNow that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on.\nBikini:\nMystic Elise was staying in the corner room, which faces out onto the courtyard.\nBikini:\nThe stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window.\nEdgeworth:\n(...It doesn't feel like she is lying. This is very powerful testimony, too. She claims to have seen the instant in which the defendant stabbed the victim... There are only two things I can believe in right now... My client, Iris, and my own abilities as a defense attorney.)\nEdgeworth:\n...Impressive logic. That's what I'd like to say, anyway.\nBikini:\nOh please, do! My brain is something else... especially in winter!\nEdgeworth:\nHowever... I think you are overlooking one thing. ...Ms. von Karma. Would you be so kind as to take another look at the autopsy report?\nvon Karma:\nT-The autopsy report...?\nEdgeworth:\nThe victim did fall from a height of 10 feet. ...However. This fall... was after she was killed.\nvon Karma:\nAh...!\nJudge:\nT-That's right! It says \"after death\" right here!\nEdgeworth:\nThe scene the witness claims to have seen is contradictory! If the defendant stabbed and killed the victim there in the courtyard... ...how did the victim then go on to take a ten foot fall!?\nvon Karma:\nAaah!\nJudge:\nO-Order! Order! The victim was killed and then fell! If that is the case... ...then the victim must have been killed in her room... Don't you agree?\nvon Karma:\nTh-That is the logical conclusion... Yes, that's right! The victim must have been stabbed by the defendant in her own room! And she was then thrown out of her window down into the courtyard below!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nWere there any signs of a struggle in Ms. Deauxnim's room...?\nvon Karma:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nShe was stabbed with a sword! That would leave a blood stain, wouldn't you agree?\nJudge:\nW-Well, Ms. von Karma? Was there any blood...? Waaaaaah!\nvon Karma:\n...No traces of blood were found in the victim's room.\nJudge:\n...Your whip has just caused traces of blood to be found on my glorious playoff beard. However! If there was no blood in the room, then your claim that... Waaaaah!\nvon Karma:\nI'm sure there's no need for me to go over this... ...as I'm sure Your Honor is well aware... ...of when a stab wound produces the most blood.\nJudge:\nWhen it produces the most blood...?\nvon Karma:\nVery little blood is actually lost at the moment of a blade's insertion. If you want to talk about when the most blood would be lost from a body... ...that would be when the blade is removed.\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. With the weapon still in place... ...it acts like a lid on the wound.\nJudge:\nThat's true... With the weapon still in the body, there wouldn't be much bleeding... A perfectly reasonable line of thinking!\nvon Karma:\nWe have come to a conclusion then! The victim was thrown out of the window with the sword still in place... This removes all of the contradictions!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order! I must admit that this is a probable version of events!\nEdgeworth:\n(I'd expect no less from Franziska von Karma... She locates and takes control of every vital point!)\nvon Karma:\n...Hmph...\nJudge:\nIt seems... ...that we need a clearer testimony from the witness. Remove all supposition on your part and tell us only the truth, please! Witness! Please! Remain standing on the crate!\nBikini:\nDon't go selling me short now! The weight of winter snow has bent me out of shape! ...Especially my back and my mood!\nvon Karma:\nSister. Please, give us your testimony. I will give you a vigorous massage once we are finished here.\nEdgeworth:\n(...With the whip?)\nBikini:\n...Oh, boy. Alright, alright...\nWitness Testimony\n-- Further Details --\nBikini:\nWhen I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place.\nThinking about it now, I didn't actually see her stab Mystic Elise.\nI've never seen so much blood before...\nThat's when I fainted. You can't blame me, can you?\nAnd when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back!\nJudge:\nHmm... This all confirms Ms. von Karma's theory...\nvon Karma:\nVon Karmas strive for nothing but perfection. Putting together such facts is nothing for me! You should know that, Miles Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\n(\"Perfection\" is an impossibility, Franziska von Karma... And I'm here to teach you just that...)\nCross Examination\n-- Further Details --\nBikini:\nWhen I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place.\nBikini:\nThinking about it now, I didn't actually see her stab Mystic Elise.\nBikini:\nI saw the instant in which the blade, plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out.\nBikini:\nI've never seen so much blood before...\nBikini:\nThat's when I fainted. You can't blame me, can you?\nBikini:\nAnd when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back!\nEdgeworth:\n(There are too many unnatural elements in this case... Why was it necessary to use the Shichishito from the Ami statue as a weapon? Why was the weapon finally placed back in the hand of the statue? If I can expose the flaws in this testimony, perhaps then I will begin to find the truth.)\nEdgeworth:\nSister Bikini. You are a reliable witness... At least, I'd like to think so. But there are too many contradictions here.\nBikini:\nW-What do you mean? You make it sound as though I'm a liar! But... You're a handsome young man, so I'll forgive you.\nvon Karma:\nWhat contradictions are you talking about?\nEdgeworth:\nIn the scene that the witness claims to have seen... ...the weapon was thrust up to its hilt into the victim. Furthermore... the killer withdrew the weapon smoothly from the body. ...However! Both of these are complete impossibilities!\nJudge:\nWhat do you mean...? Please, explain you... Uwaaaaah!\nvon Karma:\nExplain yourself!\nEdgeworth:\nTo start with... Do you think it would be possible to stab someone to the hilt with this? No matter how I look at the defendant, she doesn't appear strong enough for that.\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\n\"Doesn't appear\"...? What meaningless dribble! I, too, may appear to be weak and frail... But I can crush men under my heel and make them weep, should I so choose!\nJudge:\nThe objection stands! I wept a little back there, I must admit.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\n...That isn't the only issue here. If this sword was truly stabbed into the body up to the hilt... Well, just look at all the branches on it. It certainly wouldn't come out smoothly.\nvon Karma:\nT-That's...\nEdgeworth:\nWe also have the problem of the amount of bleeding. It's true that when a blade is left in a body, it acts as a \"plug\" of sorts. However! When the weapon is shaped like this, it's an entirely different story. The wound would be too large for the blade to completely stop from bleeding!\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nT-That's nothing more than conjecture! In reality, the victim was stabbed with the Shichishito. Even a weapon of this nature... ...may still sometimes slide out smoothly, and may still sometimes stop the blood loss!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nI'm not finished. There is still one more... conclusive contradiction.\nJudge:\nY-You've still got more!?\nEdgeworth:\n...This one is simple. If this sword really was thrust in all the way to the hilt... ...why is there only blood on the tip of it?\nvon Karma:\nAh...!\nEdgeworth:\nIf this witness is telling the truth... Then there should be blood along the entire length of the sword!\nvon Karma:\nNoooooo!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Ord-- Whaaaaaaaa!\nvon Karma:\nBravo... Miles Edgeworth. Raising this many contradictions from a single piece of evidence! All the other attorneys I know could maybe manage one, if that!\nJudge:\nBut what does this all mean!? You have proven contradictions regarding the murder weapon, but...\nEdgeworth:\n...Having come this far, there can only be one answer.\nvon Karma:\nAnd that is...?\nEdgeworth:\nThe weapon used to kill the victim... ...was not the Shichishito!\nJudge:\nW-Whaaaaaaaaat!?\nvon Karma:\nA foolishly foolish idea born from the foolish mind of a foolhardy foolish fool.\nEdgeworth:\nLet's examine this again. What was it that made us think this sword was the murder weapon?\nBikini:\nW-Well... It's because Mystic Ami was holding it...\nEdgeworth:\n...Exactly. However! If you reflect on this, that is the only basis we have to assume such a thing. The impression left by the scene was just too strong. That is what influenced us. It influenced us to believe that the Shichishito was the murder weapon!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order! Waaaaaaaaah!\nvon Karma:\nSo maybe the Shichishito was not the murder weapon. Even if that is the case... it changes nothing, Miles Edgeworth! The Sister here saw everything! She saw the defendant stab the victim with a sword-like object.\nJudge:\nHmmmmmm... That's true! Your response, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n... If that is so... I would like the prosecution to answer the obvious question it raises.\nJudge:\nThe obvious... question?\nEdgeworth:\n...Yes. Namely... Where did the real murder weapon disappear to?\nvon Karma:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nIt goes without saying that the police searched the Main Hall and the surrounding area. ...Perhaps the prosecution can enlighten us as to if a \"sword-like object\" was found.\nvon Karma:\nT-That's...\nJudge:\nAnswer the question, Ms. von Karma!\nvon Karma:\n... No evidence of that kind was found.\nJudge:\nHmmmmm... Another mystery to throw onto the pile! A trial without a murder weapon is a tricky beast!\nBikini:\nExcuse me... Could I say something...? I just remembered something, actually...\nvon Karma:\n...What is it, Sister?\nBikini:\nI was just thinking... It's possible... ...that just maybe... what actually happened was... it was just over there...\nJudge:\n... What exactly are you going on aboot here?\nBikini:\nThe murder weapon, I mean! Maybe... I think I might know where the sword was disposed of!\nEdgeworth:\nYou what!?\nvon Karma:\nWell then... I think we need to hear testimony from you one more time, Sister.\nEdgeworth:\n(Impossible...! What else... What else could this old woman have seen!?)\nWitness Testimony\n-- Location of the Weapon --\nBikini:\nI saw the murder at around 11 PM...\nAnd after asking that it be reported, I went out to the Main Gate.\nAnd there... I saw tracks! Tracks that indicated the snowmobile had been used!\nIt takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, but less than 5 using one of those!\nMaybe they threw the weapon into Eagle River and came back while I was knocked out?\n...Iris could have done that. She can drive a snowmobile after all...\nJudge:\nHmmmmmm... Witness. Please, tell us everything you know right away next time.\nBikini:\nWell. I'm not in the best of shape. What with my back and my age, you know.\nvon Karma:\nQuite... There were indeed snowmobile tracks in front of the Main Gate. Here is a photograph.\nJudge:\nA snowmobile, eh... I see. Well, it certainly is an interesting theory...\nvon Karma:\nThe tracks begin in front of Hazakura Temple... ...and run all the way to Dusky Bridge!\nTracks Photo added to the Court Record.\nvon Karma:\n...That solves your pesky little problem, yes? The Eagle River's current is quite swift, meaning that it doesn't freeze over in winter. Making it the perfect place to dispose of the murder weapon!\nEdgeworth:\n(Did she really go to the river to dispose of the murder weapon...?)\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth! ...Your cross-examination, please.\nCross Examination\n-- Location of the Weapon --\nBikini:\nI saw the murder at around 11 PM...\nBikini:\nAnd after asking that it be reported, I went out to the Main Gate.\nBikini:\nAnd there... I saw tracks! Tracks that indicated the snowmobile had been used!\nBikini:\nIt takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, but less than 5 using one of those!\nBikini:\nMaybe they threw the weapon into Eagle River and came back while I was knocked out?\nBikini:\n...Iris could have done that. She can drive a snowmobile after all...\nEdgeworth:\n(Another mystery to feed the fire... \"Was there any reason to go and throw away the murder weapon\"...? Luckily, there is surely a problem with this testimony. Now all I have to do is start poking holes in this flawed account...)\nEdgeworth:\nI admit this photograph proves something. It proves that the snowmobile was used on the night of the murder.\nvon Karma:\nYou've finally accepted the inevitable, it seems... Miles Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nHowever... If what the witness says is true, why is there only one set of tracks?\nvon Karma:\nWhat do you mean...?\nEdgeworth:\nIris left Hazakura Temple, threw the weapon into the river, and then returned. If this was the case, then naturally there should be two sets of tracks in the snow! Those from heading out to the bridge, and those from coming back.\nBikini:\n... Ah...! You're right!\nvon Karma:\nHmph... You are forgetting one thing, Miles Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\n...?\nvon Karma:\nOn the night of the murder, it was snowing. The tracks leading to the bridge were erased by the snowfall. This removes your precious contradiction, now doesn't it!\nJudge:\nI see! While she was at the river, the snow stopped... ...leaving just the return tracks in the snow.\nvon Karma:\nWhat do you have to say now, Miles Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\n(Is there a flaw in her theory...? This idea that the snowfall covered one set of tracks...?)\nEdgeworth:\nThe tracks to the river were covered by snow... What a nice theory. However, Ms. von Karma... That is impossible.\nvon Karma:\n... Would you care to explain... ...why there is a rude index finger currently pointed in my general direction?\nEdgeworth:\n...No need. The evidence will do all of the talking for me.\nJudge:\nOn the night of the murder the killer went to, and returned from, Dusky Bridge... ...in order to dispose of the murder weapon. The outgoing tracks were erased by snow. ...Or so claims Ms. von Karma. Mr. Edgeworth! Present your evidence to the contrary, eh! Evidence that the outgoing tracks were not covered by snow!\nEdgeworth:\nUltimately, it all comes down to one point. That being... Whether or not it was snowing in that courtyard when the victim was stabbed...\nvon Karma:\nThat's right. But proving that is...\nEdgeworth:\nIncredibly easy.\nvon Karma:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nIf we want to know whether it was snowing or not, this photo will tell us everything. Of course, I am referring to the photo of the crime scene. As you can see... everything is covered with snow. ...With just one exception.\nvon Karma:\nAnd that is...?\nEdgeworth:\nThe victim herself, Ms. Elise Deauxnim! Why is there no snow on top of her...? The answer is simple! It had stopped snowing when she was killed, that's why!\nvon Karma:\nGnnngh!\nEdgeworth:\nIn other words! If the killer really did go to the Eagle River to dispose of the murder weapon... ...then in this photograph, there should be two sets of tracks!\nvon Karma:\nAaaaah!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Just what are you... Gyahaah!\nvon Karma:\nJ-Just what are you suggesting, Miles Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\n(To be honest... I am not entirely sure myself. But...) This is simply what all of the facts point to. That night... someone used the snowmobile to leave Hazakura Temple. From the tracks left, it can be understood that they were heading for Dusky Bridge. At that time... it was still snowing.\nvon Karma:\nOf course it was. Because those tracks were erased by the snow. (Changed from [Of course it was. Because those tracks were gone.] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\nThen when this person returned to Hazakura Temple... ...the snow had stopped. Thus, the return tracks remained.\nJudge:\nHmmmmm...\nBikini:\nCan I say something? This all sounds a bit fishy to me...\nvon Karma:\n...What does, Sister?\nBikini:\nThere is only one key for the snowmobile.\nEdgeworth:\n...!\nvon Karma:\nFurthermore, on the night in question, we know that the defendant had it! The key was found in her room after the murder!\nBikini:\n...Which can only mean, that night... Iris used the snowmobile to go to the Inner Temple...\nEdgeworth:\n(But... Iris said that she never went there... I should probably press on this point some more when I get the chance...)\nBikini:\nThe snowmobile can't cross the suspension bridge... So, she must have left it on the Hazakura side of the bridge and crossed on foot.\nJudge:\n...That sounds right.\nBikini:\nBut... What's odd is, when I left Iris and returned to Hazakura Temple... I didn't see anything near Dusky Bridge.\nvon Karma:\nY-You must have just failed to see it, Sister.\nBikini:\nMaybe... But when I made it back to Hazakura Temple... ...it was there, by the Main Gate... The snowmobile, I mean. I know what I saw. It was covered in snow, too...\nEdgeworth:\nB-But that... isn't possible!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order in the court! ...What does this all mean?\nvon Karma:\n...Nngh...\nEdgeworth:\nSo then what was the snowmobile used for...? It wasn't taken by the defendant when she went to the Inner Temple. If it had been, then the witness couldn't possibly have seen it by the gate. Furthermore... it wasn't used by the killer to dispose of the murder weapon. If that was the case, there should be two sets of tracks in this photo. All we know is this... After it stopped snowing... someone used the snowmobile to return to Hazakura Temple!\nJudge:\nHmmmmmm...\nEdgeworth:\n(I never thought a simple snowmobile could cause so much trouble...)\nJudge:\n... I think we've learned all we can from this witness... (Changed from [I think we've arrived at this point due to the witness...] in the original release)\nBikini:\nYes, yes. I've nothing more to add. I've told you everything -- everything that I know.\nJudge:\nBut then... that still leaves us with the same problem. (Changed from [Well then... That still leaves us with the same problem.] in the original release) If only there was someone... A witness who could testify to having seen the snowmobile!\nEdgeworth:\n(A witness, huh...)\nJudge:\nWas there no one out, walking perhaps, near Dusky Bridge on that night?\nBikini:\n... I don't think that's likely. It was cold enough to freeze your ears off. Only an idiot would go out wandering in that. ...Unless they had something really important to do.\nJudge:\nHmmmm... That's a shame.\nEdgeworth:\n(Hold on... Something is coming to me... An idiot may well have gone wandering out on that sub-arctic night!) ...Your Honor! Actually... there just might be one individual who may be of help to us. (Changed from [I actually have an idea... There may be one individual able to help us.] in the original release)\nJudge:\nR-Really!?\nvon Karma:\n...You know of someone who might have seen the snowmobile on the night of the murder...?\nEdgeworth:\nI don't know for sure if he saw it or not... But there are two things about him that do come to mind.\nJudge:\nWhich are...?\nEdgeworth:\nFirst... that he saw \"something incredible\" on the night of the murder.\nvon Karma:\n...And the second being?\nEdgeworth:\nThis individual that I am thinking of went wandering outside on that cold night... In other words, he is our kind of idiot.\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth! Who is this idiot you're talking aboot!?\nJudge:\nThis guy must be a product of \"Jean-Luc de Laduc's Guide To Obnoxious French Painting\"...\nEdgeworth:\nThis is Larry Butz... The student of the victim, Elise Deauxnim.\nJudge:\nHer student...? Interesting. Why was he wandering on the night of the murder?\nEdgeworth:\nT-That's... (I could tell them all about his designs for Iris... But it may cost us his credibility as a witness... Before I even call him.) He is, after all, an artist. He was, perhaps, searching for something in the snowy scenery that would move him. ...Although I cannot guarantee that this is the reason.\nvon Karma:\nAnd so...? This unfortunate, unreliable-looking man... What exactly was it that he saw?\nEdgeworth:\nI intend to extract that from him, right here in this courtroom.\nJudge:\nSummon this youth as a witness immediately!\nvon Karma:\n... I have no choice, do I?\nEdgeworth:\nI believe he is in the gallery for this trial. It will not take long to summon him.\nJudge:\n...Very well.\nEdgeworth:\n(Larry... You may have escaped me yesterday... But today I'm going to get everything out of you!)\nJudge:\n...The court will now adjourn for a 20 minute break. Ms. von Karma, please see to preparing the next witness.\nvon Karma:\n...Understood, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nGood... Well then! Court is now in recess!\nTo be continued.\nFebruary 9, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1\nIris:\nExcuse me... Mr. Edgeworth? I'm not really sure what to say...\nEdgeworth:\nIris. We only have 20 minutes. There are two things which I need to ask you before we reconvene.\nIris:\n...Alright. I'll help you any way I can.\nEdgeworth:\nFirst, about that night. You really didn't go to the Inner Temple, correct? The last witness claims to have met and talked with you in the Training Hall. Either you or Sister Bikini... ...is lying.\nIris:\n... Mr. Edgeworth. It is just as I said yesterday. Until the incident occurred... I was in my own room, in Hazakura Temple.\nEdgeworth:\n...Very well. The second thing, then. That night, the temple snowmobile was used in between the time Sister Bikini... ...returned to the Main Hall and when she bore witness to the murder. Sometime between 10:30 and 11 PM that night. Were you the one who used the snowmobile?\nIris:\n... There is only one key for the snowmobile. The only person who could have used it... was me.\nEdgeworth:\nSo it was you...! But... why? ...What made you go out to Dusky Bridge?\nIris:\n... I'm sorry, Mr. Edgeworth.\n5 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nEdgeworth:\nIris...\nIris:\nI can't... tell you about that... yet.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Yet\"...?\nIris:\nNot until her safety is confirmed...\nEdgeworth:\nHer?\nIris:\nThe safety of the acolyte...\nEdgeworth:\n(The \"acolyte\", huh... She's must be talking about Maya...) ... Iris. Look me in the eye and tell me the truth. Did you kill Elise Deauxnim?\nIris:\n... No matter who or what may come... I could never take a life.\nEdgeworth:\n... (As I thought... no Psycholocks...) ...Very well. It is my job to get to the truth. You'll discover this for yourself soon enough.\nFebruary 9, 11:36 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 7\nJudge:\n...Court will now reconvene. Ms. von Karma. Where is the witness...?\nvon Karma:\nDuring the break, a man was detained for suspicious behavior in the gallery.\nEdgeworth:\nSuspicious behavior...?\nvon Karma:\nHe was sketching something... Very intensely.\nJudge:\nDare I ask what the witness was sketching when he was detained?\nvon Karma:\nHe drew a terrifying woman, armed with a demonic face and a vicious whip.\nJudge:\n... I can only presume that his intention was to capture you-- ...Aaaah!\nvon Karma:\nAnyway, it's time to drag this pathetic excuse for an artist before the court! Laurice Deauxnim! I hope you're ready... Get in here!\nEdgeworth:\n(It would seem that whip is going to see plenty more use today...)\nButz:\nOuch!\nvon Karma:\n...Your sketch is in contempt of this court!\nButz:\nH-Hey! I was just artistically rendering... Ou-Ouch!\nvon Karma:\nYou tried to run away from the bailiff who was trying to hand you your subpoena, correct?\nButz:\nL-Look! I'm nothing but a fledgling artist, training out in the mountains! I'm only down here in the city because I ran out of green paint. Well, to use the technical term for the color, \"viridian\".\nEdgeworth:\n...Larry... This isn't an art store, now is it...?\nButz:\nI know! I graduated junior high, OK!? Look. Art is all about working in the fields, isn't it?\nJudge:\nWorking in the fields...?\nEdgeworth:\nI presume he wanted to say \"field work\"... I hope.\nButz:\nTh-That's it! Thanks, buddy!\nEdgeworth:\n(It's kind of sad that I was able to understand his mangled train wreck of a sentence...)\nButz:\nI just happened to stop in here and found a wonderful new model!\nvon Karma:\n...\nButz:\nSo see!? I've got nothing to do with this trial! At all! I expect all of your faces to be red when you realize this mistake! Bright red! Or, to use the technical term, \"crimson lake\". ...Ou-Ou-Ouch! Ou-Ou-Ou-Ouch! Ouch!\nJudge:\nOu-Ou-Ou-Ouch! Ouch! Ou-Ouch!\nvon Karma:\nStop your pathetic blabbing and testify like a man!\nJudge:\nRefrain from whipping me, Ms. von Karma! Cross-whipping is as bad as cross-checking. Witness! That was all your fault! Testify, now!\nButz:\nWaaaah... This is almost too much for me...!\nWitness Testimony\n-- What I Saw --\nButz:\nI was at that lodge out in the mountains, looking up at the stars that night.\nI walked to the bridge a number of times, but...\nI didn't see a s-snowmobile!\nI didn't see anyone at the bridge that night either! (Changed from [I didn't meet anyone at the bridge that night!] in the original release)\nThe girl I was waiting for didn't show up... My teacher died on me...\nI'm all alone now. Aren't I, Edgeyyyyy...!?\nJudge:\nWitness! Please refrain from talking directly to the lawyers during your testimony!\nButz:\nI-I'm just a nobody! Nothing but a small, worthless man, aren't I!? And why wasn't I asked for my name and occupation... or anything else...!?\nJudge:\n... Mr. Edgeworth. This man seems to have quite a severe inferiority complex.\nEdgeworth:\n...He's recently been the cause of numerous incidents. I think he's finally realized for himself... ...just how much of a nuisance he has been to other people!\nButz:\nYeah, that's right! I'm behind everything, every case! Watch out, OK! Just touching me will make you eternally unhappy!\nJudge:\n...Well then, let us proceed with the cross-examination. With no touching, thank you. We can delve into other details at a later time.\nCross Examination\n-- What I Saw --\nButz:\nI was at that lodge out in the mountains, looking up at the stars that night.\nButz:\nI walked to the bridge a number of times, but...\nButz:\nI didn't see a s-snowmobile!\nButz:\nI didn't see anyone at the bridge that night either! (Changed from [I didn't meet anyone at the bridge that night!] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\n(It seems that he's going to claim to have nothing to do with this to the end. I don't want this guy to cost us any more time... I need to slice through his obvious contradictions and keep things moving along...)\nEdgeworth:\nLarry Butz... I can understand why you might want to throw your old life away. You're pretty pathetic, and you cause all sorts of trouble...\nButz:\nI'm sorry...!\nEdgeworth:\nBut... Having realized just how much of a nuisance you have been... ...that could be considered a step in the right direction.\nButz:\nEdgey! Are you... trying to console me?\nJudge:\nIt certainly doesn't sound that way to me.\nEdgeworth:\nHowever... I cannot forgive you for simply turning away from the incidents you create!\nButz:\nWaaah... You're totally pinning this on me...\nEdgeworth:\n...Now then. Let us talk about the night of the murder. Sister Bikini, after seeing the murder take place, asked Phoenix Wright to report it. Thus, he headed for the public phone by the bridge... There, he happened across a certain nefarious individual! You, Larry Butz!\nButz:\n... That's right. Me, in the flesh.\nJudge:\nHmm... Listen carefully, witness. It doesn't matter if you change your name. So long as you remain pretty pathetic, you will continue to cause these incidents! That reality will not change!\nButz:\nB-But...! What do you want me to do, then!?\nEdgeworth:\nLarry. What you need to change is your inner self. But for now... (Changed from [Larry. What you need to change is your inner self.] in the original release) \"What you saw that night\"... Testifying truthfully about this one issue is all I need from you. (Changed from [Testify truthfully! That is all you can do for now.] in the original release)\nButz:\n... Edgey... I... I think... I've finally woken up! ... Well. I guess I could still be sleeping... But anyway! I'll do it! I'll testify! ... Well. I'm not sure this'll go especially well...\nJudge:\nI'll ask again, then, witness. What did you see on the night of the murder?\nWitness Testimony\n-- What I Saw, Pt. 2 --\nButz:\nI went to the shack at around 9, so it would have been about 10:30 PM...\nI was lying under my bedding when a white flash almost blinded me!\nI looked out the window... and Dusky Bridge was on fire!\nThere was still some thunder, but I went right away to check it out.\nThat's when I ran into Nick.\nJudge:\nHmmmm... You certainly saw quite a lot, didn't you?\nvon Karma:\nSo... what happened to the bridge after it caught on fire?\nButz:\nIt was like me after a three-day stint chasing a girl... It totally burnt out. Like, almost totally gone. ...I mean, trying to cross the burning remains was what caused Nick to fall.\nvon Karma:\nW-What did you say!?\nEdgeworth:\nOh, don't worry... It's nothing life-threatening. He just caught a cold. (Changed from [Oh, don't worry... nothing life-threatening. He just caught a cold.] in the original release)\nvon Karma:\n...I never know with that man if he should be called lucky or unlucky... (Changed from [As always, hard to know if he should be called lucky or unlucky...] in the original release)\nJudge:\nNow, Mr. Edgeworth! Please commence your cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- What I Saw, Pt. 2 --\nButz:\nI went to the shack at around 9, so it would have been about 10:30 PM...\nButz:\nI was lying under my bedding when a white flash almost blinded me!\nButz:\nI looked out the window... and Dusky Bridge was on fire!\nButz:\nThere was still some thunder, but I went right away to check it out.\nButz:\nThat's when I ran into Nick.\nButz:\nI arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later.\nButz:\nI thought I'd never get another chance to see something so big burning!\nEdgeworth:\n(...He told me about the burning bridge yesterday. But there's still something that doesn't quite fit... It looks like... ...despite his change of heart, Larry still isn't telling us the whole truth.)\nEdgeworth:\nYour very existence being a contradiction, I'm not sure if you can grasp this or not...\nButz:\nWhat the hey, Edgey!? You make me sound like some sort of alien!\nEdgeworth:\nBut your testimony is conclusively contradictory. The problem here... is time.\nButz:\nI've never been the best timekeeper, you know. \"Three minutes after Billy leaves on foot, you follow him on your bicycle. How long does it take for you to catch up with him?\" Terrible at those.\nEdgeworth:\n...This is much more simple. You saw the lightning strike Dusky Bridge... ...and immediately went to see what had happened. ...Is this correct?\nButz:\nYeah... Well, I wasted about five minutes first, but more or less.\nEdgeworth:\n...I have the weather data from the night of the murder here. According to this, the lightning fell at 10:45 PM. You say it takes less than five minutes from the shack to Dusky Bridge. Meaning you probably got there at around 11 PM.\nButz:\n...That all sounds about right, I guess. And then Nick showed up and did his falling act.\nEdgeworth:\nThat is impossible.\nvon Karma:\n...What do you mean?\nEdgeworth:\n11 PM is when the murder occurred in Hazakura Temple. Thus... Wright was still there, in the courtyard. There is no way that Larry could have encountered him at Dusky Bridge at that time!\nvon Karma:\n...!\nButz:\nAh! Excuse me! I-I have an objection!\nJudge:\nYou do?\nButz:\nEdgey! How many times do I have to say this!? I'm not Larry! I'm Laurice Deauxnim! Gyaaah!\nvon Karma:\n...It has not been proven that the murder occurred at 11 PM. The Sister only said, \"around 11\". ...In which case! It could have been earlier than that!\nEdgeworth:\n...Watch your footing there, Ms. Franziska von Karma. The slope ahead is slippery! For there is still no way that Wright could have been at Dusky Bridge at 11 PM!\nvon Karma:\nAnd why not!?\nEdgeworth:\nIt is clearly written here in the weather data report. It took around 30 minutes for the bridge to burn out. Therefore! The bridge must have been burning until at least 11:15 PM!\nJudge:\nWhich means... what, exactly?\nEdgeworth:\nWright did not see the bridge as it was burning that night. In fact, he did not arrive on the scene until after the flames had died down! (Changed from [He did not arrive there until after the flames had died down!] in the original release; extra space between [had] and [died] in the Trilogy release) ...Larry! You arrived at the bridge at 11 PM. But Wright did not make it there until at least 11:15... (Changed from [Wright did not make it there until at least 11:15...] in the original release) I suggest you to stop hiding things and just tell us the whole truth. Now, then... (Changed from [Are you still trying to hide something from us!?] in the original release) What happened during these missing 15 minutes!?\nButz:\nUrk... I... I feel like I just got brutally woken up by toilet splashback... (Changed from [I... I feel like I just woke up...] in the original release) I guess I was still sleeping after all! Ha ha ha! Pinch me!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order! Ordaaaaaaaaagh!\nvon Karma:\n...So there was a missing 15 minutes prior to meeting Phoenix Wright. I hardly see that as much of a problem!\nButz:\nYeah! Not much of a problem at all!\nEdgeworth:\nReally...? The bridge is burning before your eyes, and there is a phone right next to it. Why, then, did you not report the accident?\nJudge:\nYes, witness! Why didn't you!? Were you there simply to watch the bridge burn? (Changed from [Did you simply... watch the bridge burn?] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\nAnd therein lies the problem. (Changed from [That is the problem here...] in the original release) For even after the bridge had burnt out, he was still there! (Changed from [Even after the bridge burnt out, he was still there!] in the original release) Staring into space, this witness didn't even attempt to fulfill his civic duty! (Changed from [He simply stood there and didn't report anything.] in the original release)\nvon Karma:\nTh-That's what it sounds like...\nEdgeworth:\nAh, but this is Larry we are talking about, and even he is incapable of being so stupid. (Changed from [This might be Larry we are talking about, but even he is incapable of being so stupid.] in the original release) Which means there has to be a reason for his inaction! (Changed from [There has to be a reason for his inaction!] in the original release)\nButz:\n... Edgey... I think it's about time I got serious with you, dude.\nEdgeworth:\n...Just as I thought, you've been playing with us all this time.\nButz:\nListen... I'm... I'm going to tell you everything! Are you sure you want to hear it all!?\nEdgeworth:\nY-Yes...\nButz:\nI may reeeeally say it this time! Everything! Kahaah!\nvon Karma:\n...Then say it!\nJudge:\nVery well... I have a terribly bad feeling aboot this; however... ...let's have the witness finally give us the whole truth. Now... for this 15 minute gap, what where you doing, witness!?\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Missing 15 Minutes --\nButz:\nI'm a Deauxnim. I'm an artist! What do you think I was doing?\nSketching! In front of the bridge! I was whipped up into a frenzy of art!\nThe shock and awe that I was feeling... I transferred it all directly onto the page!\n...Before I realized it, the flames had gone out and then he came running up.\nJudge:\nHmmmmm... I suppose artists can be strange folk...\nButz:\nThat's right! I'm willing to sacrifice everything in order to draw the perfect sketch!\nEdgeworth:\n(...Including the truth, from the sound of it!)\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth. Has this removed the last of your doubts?\nEdgeworth:\nNot at all, Your Honor. One very large doubt still remains.\nJudge:\nAnd what would that be?\nEdgeworth:\nThis is a surprisingly believable story, especially considering the source... So why did he think he needed to hide it from us until now? I intend to drag the reason out of him!\nButz:\nHah ha ha! You'll regret this, Edgey!\nCross Examination\n-- The Missing 15 Minutes --\nButz:\nI'm a Deauxnim. I'm an artist! What do you think I was doing?\nButz:\nSketching! In front of the bridge! I was whipped up into a frenzy of art!\nButz:\nI saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering!\nButz:\nThe shock and awe that I was feeling... I transferred it all directly onto the page!\nButz:\n...Before I realized it, the flames had gone out and then he came running up.\nEdgeworth:\n(There is a big clue waiting for me in this cross-examination... This testimony does nothing less than mock the court... But I am sure that there is a vital kernel of truth hidden in it somewhere!)\nEdgeworth:\nLarry. What did you really see that night...? Not that I particularly care.\nButz:\nIn your position, that's just being irresponsible! I... I drew exactly what I saw! I'll give you a whole dollar that it's the truth!\nEdgeworth:\nIf that is truly the case... Then there is one thing that we can say for certain.\nJudge:\nWhat might that be...?\nEdgeworth:\nThat the person who flew over the bridge... ...could not have been the defendant, Iris!\nButz:\nW-W-What!? What do you mean? I don't understand!? Uwaaagh!\nvon Karma:\nA foolhardy folly of a foolish statement by an equally foolishly foolhardy fool. How, exactly, can you make this claim?\nEdgeworth:\n...Tell us, Larry. According to this picture... ...the individual whom you say you saw was wearing a hood. Correct?\nButz:\nOf course she was! That run-down shack is quite a way from the bridge... The hood is what told me that this floating angel was my Iris! The hood is my darling Iris! And Iris is my darling hood! Waaah!\nvon Karma:\nIt seems there are bigger fools in this world than the one at the defense's bench.\nEdgeworth:\n...Larry, there's something you need to be made aware of. On the night of the murder... Iris wasn't wearing her hood. She had given it to Wright as a gift! Are you going to change your story now? Perhaps suggest it was Wright who took flight!?\nButz:\nW-What are you talking about!?\nEdgeworth:\n...I think you understand what I mean just fine.\nButz:\nWhy...? Why did Nick have Iris's hood!?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat...? (Changed from [Eh...?] in the original release)\nButz:\nEdgey! What's going on with Iris and Nick!? Why you, Niiiiiick! You dooooooog!\nJudge:\nI do believe... ...that this unbelievably mysterious sketch... ...is destined to disappear, discredited and discarded. Straight into the garbage.\nButz:\n...Hah... Hah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hagaaah!\nvon Karma:\n...What is it now, witness?\nButz:\nIt feels like... I've been waiting 25 years for this very day to come! Edgey! Today is the day I get to completely stupefy you!\nEdgeworth:\nW-What...!?\nJudge:\nWhat is the meaning of your outburst, witness!?\nButz:\n...I hate to have to do this, but I have some definitive evidence.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Definitive\"...?\nvon Karma:\n\"Evidence\"...?\nButz:\nIris did indeed come flying over the burning bridge! And I, Laurice Deauxnim... ...shall prove it!\nJudge:\nI didn't expect to ask this again... But we shall be needing your testimony once again. Tell us anything you know concerning the defendant as depicted in this sketch... And show us your evidence that this nightmare was actually a reality!\nButz:\n...OK. I hope you're ready, Edgey! Because I'm going to feed you a whopping serving of pain!\nEdgeworth:\n(...You've been serving us a whopping serving of pain this whole time. Trust me.)\nWitness Testimony\n-- Proof That Iris Flew! --\nButz:\nWhen I reached Dusky Bridge she was already gone...\nI was so worried! So I frantically searched all over for her!\nThat led to me finding a beautiful crystal sphere, half-buried in the snow!\nI'm sure that Iris was simply wearing a spare hood.\nAfter all, no one else could have lost a crystal sphere that night.\nJudge:\nA c-crystal sphere...!?\nButz:\nThis one. Pretty, isn't it? But finders keepers!\nvon Karma:\nThat sphere... Where did you find it?\nButz:\nLet me see... Around here, somewhere? Looks about right.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd it was half-buried in the snow...?\nButz:\nIt had pretty much stopped snowing by then... But there was still some falling as I walked to the bridge.\nJudge:\nHmmmm... The court accepts this crystal sphere!\nButz:\n...That's mine, OK!? I want it back afterward!\nJudge:\nHmm... There's something on it... (Changed from [There's something on it, isn't there...] in the original release)\nvon Karma:\n...?\nJudge:\nOh my... It's blood! (Changed from [Oh my... It's a blood stain!] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\n(What!? Blood...!?) (Changed from [What!? A blood stain...!?] in the original release)\nCrystal Sphere added to the Court Record.\nButz:\nYou ready, Edgey!? By tomorrow morning, you'll be calling me \"Master Larry\"! Yeah, I like the sound of that! No one's going to push me around anymore!\nEdgeworth:\n(...Didn't you want to be called \"Laurice Deauxnim\" only a few minutes ago!?)\nCross Examination\n-- Proof That Iris Flew! --\nButz:\nWhen I reached Dusky Bridge she was already gone...\nButz:\nI was so worried! So I frantically searched all over for her!\nButz:\nThat led to me finding a beautiful crystal sphere, half-buried in the snow!\nButz:\nI'm sure that Iris was simply wearing a spare hood.\nButz:\nAfter all, no one else could have lost a crystal sphere that night.\nEdgeworth:\n(This case isn't going to end without a fight... Exposing the obvious contradictions in this testimony will be easy... But I fear that all that awaits us are further mysteries!)\nEdgeworth:\n...Larry. That night... There was someone. Someone who lost a crystal sphere.\nButz:\nTh-There was...? Who!? Who was this stupid idiot!?\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Elise Deauxnim! The mentor to a stupid idiot!\nvon Karma:\nThe victim...!?\nEdgeworth:\nI have a photo of her here. And on the end of her staff, you can see a familiar looking crystal sphere.\nButz:\nH-Hey...! That's my photograph! ...Give it back! Ou-Ou-Ouuuuch!\nvon Karma:\n...A crystal sphere like that is quite easy to find. I have one just like it on my broach.\nEdgeworth:\n(They look nothing alike!) In any case... please take a look at this. This is the victim's staff, found at the scene of the crime!\nJudge:\n...Aaaaah! The crystal sphere... It's gone!\nButz:\nW-W-W-W... What!? What!? What!? What!? WHAAAAAAAAAAT!?\nJudge:\nJ-Just what does this mean!?\nEdgeworth:\nIf anyone jumped... or flew across the bridge that night... ...it certainly was not Iris! After all... She was not wearing her hood! More importantly... ...the crystal sphere found at the \"landing site\" was not hers either!\nJudge:\nT-That means... The one who flew... ...and dropped the sphere... was the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim!?\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nA fool alongside another fool, on a fool's errand to reach a foolish conclusion! First of all, this \"sketch\", which I prefer to call a \"scribble\", is ridiculous! People cannot fly! ...Thus, it is rejected!\nButz:\nY-You can't do that! I saw it! With my own two-- Eyeeeeeeiiiz!\nvon Karma:\n...And this crystal sphere. This is nothing more than a red herring!\nEdgeworth:\nYou honestly believe that...?\nvon Karma:\nGive it some thought, and I'm sure you'll realize it as well, Miles Edgeworth! Elise Deauxnim was in her room on the night of the murder. There was no reason for her to go to Dusky Bridge! Therefore, this sphere cannot be related to this case. That is all.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\n...Ms. Franziska von Karma. The only people who will accept that explanation... are scatterbrains and clowns!\nButz:\nWhy are you pointing at me!?\nEdgeworth:\nThe victim's crystal sphere was found near the bridge on the night of her murder. Yet you expect us to believe this has nothing to do with the case!?\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nThat crystal sphere... It was probably thrown away at the bridge after the murder.\nJudge:\nAfter the murder?\nvon Karma:\nThere is blood on the crystal sphere, isn't there? This naturally suggests that it was thrown away after the murder took place. The killer placed it there to throw the investigation off the scent... Which is the exact same reason that he drew that ridiculous sketch! (Changed from [The same reason that he drew that ridiculous sketch!] in the original release)\nButz:\n... ...... What...? You mean... I'm the killer!? No waaaagh!\nvon Karma:\nAll joking aside... (Changed from [Enough joking...] in the original release) Just when did this crystal sphere appear near the foot of the bridge? Unless this can be proven in some way, I refuse to believe this is related to the case!\nEdgeworth:\n(She makes a valid point... There is no evidence that Elise Deauxnim left Hazakura Temple that night. ...However, if somehow this crystal sphere... ...can be proven to have been dropped before the victim was killed... ...then this case is going to transform into something else entirely!)\nJudge:\nYour response, Mr. Edgeworth? I want your final opinion on the disposition of this crystal sphere! If it is not related to the case, then this witness who you called... ...will have been nothing more than a monumental waste of time!\nvon Karma:\nPrepare yourself for some very appropriate punishment, Miles Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\n(Can I prove it...? Can I prove that the crystal sphere was dropped before the murder took place...?)\nEdgeworth:\n...Your Honor. Allow me to prove something to you. I will prove that this crystal sphere is a vital link to solving this case!\nJudge:\nYou will do what!?\nvon Karma:\nThat look in your eyes... You remind me of Phoenix Wright when he is cornered.\nEdgeworth:\nThat should come as no surprise. (Because right now, I am Phoenix Wright, and I am indeed cornered...!)\nJudge:\nI order you to present your evidence, Mr. Edgeworth! Evidence that proves that the crystal sphere was indeed dropped before the murder!\nEdgeworth:\nThis crystal sphere... It was half-buried in the snow, correct?\nButz:\nThat's right. If it hadn't stopped snowing then it would have been game over. ...The snow would have totally covered it!\nEdgeworth:\n...That's all I needed to hear from you, Larry. ...Your testimony makes one thing quite clear.\nJudge:\nW-What...?\nEdgeworth:\nWhen the crystal sphere was dropped, it was snowing, even if it was ever so slightly...\nvon Karma:\nSnowing...?\nEdgeworth:\nOn the other hand, let us look at the scene of the murder. As proven earlier today... there is no snow on the victim's body.\nJudge:\nAh...!\nEdgeworth:\n...Therefore! The crystal sphere must have been dropped before the murder!\nvon Karma:\nWha... Whaaaaat!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order!\nEdgeworth:\nOn the night of the murder the victim did indeed go to Dusky Bridge! And there, something occurred that caused the staff's crystal sphere to come loose! (Changed from [And there, something occurred that caused this crystal sphere to come loose!] in the original release)\nJudge:\nWhat... What could that have been!?\nEdgeworth:\nThis sphere... There is some blood on it, isn't there?\nvon Karma:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nAllow me to raise a certain possibility at this junction! The real crime scene was near the foot of Dusky Bridge!\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nThe murder didn't take place in the Hazakura Temple courtyard...!? Only a fool would suggest such a foolish piece of absolute foolishness!\nEdgeworth:\nJust who is the fool? And which part is so foolish, Ms. von Karma?\nvon Karma:\nHave you been paying any attention this whole time, Miles Edgeworth!? The Sister saw everything! She saw the victim being killed by the defendant in the Hazakura Temple courtyard!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\n...That's not exactly true, now is it? To put it more precisely, what she saw was... ...the murder weapon being removed from the victim's body.\nvon Karma:\nTh-That's the same thing!\nEdgeworth:\n...No, it isn't!\nvon Karma:\n!\nEdgeworth:\n...You said it yourself.\nvon Karma:\nVery little blood is actually lost... ...at the moment of a blade's insertion. If you want to talk about when the most blood would be lost from a body... ...that would be when the blade is removed.\nEdgeworth:\nIf that statement is the truth... ...then Dusky Bridge could very easily be the scene of the murder. The murder weapon was not removed! Thus, there was no bleeding!\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nYou are forgetting one vital thing, Miles Edgeworth! Elise Deauxnim's body was found in Hazakura Temple! On foot it takes 15 minutes to travel from Dusky Bridge to Hazakura Temple. You mean to suggest someone carried the body all that way!?\nEdgeworth:\n(I've made it this far... The only place to take this is to the end! I just need to prove that my version of the events is also perfectly plausible. (Changed from [I just need to prove the possibility it happened as I presume...!] in the original release))\nJudge:\nNow, if the defense is ready, the court would like to have an explanation. Please show us the method by which the victim's body was carried to Hazakura Temple!\nEdgeworth:\nOn that snowy night... ...there is one way that a body could have been moved. The snowmobile.\nvon Karma:\nAh...!\nEdgeworth:\nAs we know... the snowmobile was used that night. It was explained as having been used to dispose of the murder weapon... But it could also have been used to carry a body!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order! Gyaaaaah!\nvon Karma:\nThis... This is completely unacceptable, Miles Edgeworth! You've dug yourself into your own grave!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean!?\nvon Karma:\nThe only one who could have used the snowmobile was the defendant. She's the one who moved the body! Doesn't that put the final nail in your coffin...?\nEdgeworth:\nHeh... You're too late... Franziska von Karma. And in fact, the defense has proven something else entirely. We have shown that this case requires further investigation!\nvon Karma:\nW-What!?\nEdgeworth:\n...Where was the victim, Elise Deauxnim really killed? ...If her body was moved, whatever for? And finally... Just what does this image mean?\nvon Karma:\nDo you even need to think about that!? Such a creature could never see the truth, let alone describe it!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\n...This witness certainly sits on one of the lowest possible branches of humanity. However! He would never utter a lie that could hurt a girl with whom he is enamored! He drew this, so it is something that actually happened. The defense stands firm on this point.\nButz:\nEd-Edgey! Thank you...!\nJudge:\n...That settles it, then. I cannot give a verdict under these circumstances.\nvon Karma:\nGrrr... Grrrrrr!\nEdgeworth:\n(Wright... I seem to have fulfilled my part in this...) It is just as I thought. Franziska von Karma... You make a wonderful partner.\nvon Karma:\nExcuse me...?\nEdgeworth:\nThere was one reason, and one alone, for me being here. To expose the darkness lurking in this case, and then pass it on to Wright!\nButz:\nR-Really? That's what this was all about? You could have just told me that from the very beginning! Then I wouldn't have had Franzy whipping me all... Daaaaaayyyowch!\nvon Karma:\nMiles Edgeworth... I don't care about what you were here to do! This was my chance to finally grind you under my heel!\nEdgeworth:\nA shame that your chance seems to have slipped you by. (Changed from [A shame that your chance seems to have slipped by you.] in the original release)\nButz:\nWhat a shame, Franzzzyyyyyyyy!\nvon Karma:\n...This is all your fault! Such a terrible witness... You are an affront to all the legal system stands for!\nButz:\nOuuuouuuouooooouuuuuououuooououooouuuuouoouuch!\nvon Karma:\nI demand satisfaction!\nJudge:\n...I cannot believe that the witness's testimony relates to an actual event. However, there has to be some sort of answer for the questions it raises. Have his words here today been the truth or lies? Next time we gather in this courtroom... ...those are the matters that shall be addressed! I am counting on thorough investigations by both the defense and the prosecution.\nEdgeworth:\n(And with this... The rest is up to you... Wright...)\nvon Karma:\n...\nJudge:\nCourt is now adjourned!\nTo be continued."

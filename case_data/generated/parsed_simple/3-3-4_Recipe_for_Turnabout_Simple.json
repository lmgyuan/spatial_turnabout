I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts.\nI-It wasn't me! I swear it wasn't me!\nJudge:\nThe evidence and testimony we have seen and heard are conclusive! The victim was alone at his table when he drank from that poisoned cup of coffee.\nNo! You're wrong! I know what I saw...! I saw... I saw...! I saw someone else there! A man. He's the real killer! Why won't anyone believe me?\nPayne:\nWell... I'd say that pretty much wraps this case up, wouldn't you... ...Mr. Wright!?\nJudge:\nThis court finds the defendant...\nGuilty\nJudge:\nThe court is adjourned.\nJanuary 6, 10:03 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nMaya:\nAhh! The start of the new year always makes me feel like I can take on the whole world!\nPhoenix:\nI bet it does, Maya.\nMaya:\nSo! I've decided that our resolution should be... Zvarri! \"Take on the world!\" What do you think?\nPhoenix:\nSure, whatever, Maya... But I think maybe you've had more than enough mistletoe cake.\nMaya:\nNever! You've got to eat a lot of cake during New Year's! It's practically a tradition! Like watching the fireworks on TV or playing a board game.\n???:\nHEY, PAL!\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe...\nMaya:\nHappy New Year, Detective!\nGumshoe:\nUh... likewise... NOW LISTEN UP, WRIGHT! I WANNA...\nMaya:\nHere's to another fruitful year of lawyer-police cooperation!\nGumshoe:\nUm... Yeah... Me too... ALRIGHT, PAL! YOU'VE GOT SOME EXPLAINING TO...\nMaya:\nHave you got a holiday present for me, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nA what? Well... I, um... Here, have this. It-It's really nothing much, but...\nMaya:\nYay! Thanks!\nGumshoe:\nLOOK, PAL, WE NEED TO HAVE A TALK. TAKE A SEAT!\nMaya:\nHey! What about Pearly? You haven't forgotten her present, have you?\nGumshoe:\nAh... N-No... I mean, yes... I mean, no... Are you doing this on purpose?\nMaya:\nHa ha, guess I'm busted. How did you like my first practical joke of the year?\nGumshoe:\nVery funny, pal. Now let's see how funny you think it is when I show you this!\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it? A magazine?\nMaya:\nHey, I wanna see! \"Deadly Poisoning Brings Guilty Verdict. Defense Attorney Wright Trounced.\"\nPhoenix:\nTr-Trounced!? Let me see that! \"The defense attorney gave an almost childishly amateur performance yesterday...\" What the heck is this!?\nGumshoe:\nIt's a report, pal. About you!\nMaya:\nListen to this! \"Mr. Wright must take full responsibility for the ruling in this case.\"\nGumshoe:\nWELL!? And don't tell me you don't remember anything about it!\nPhoenix:\nBut I don't remember anything about it! When was that issue from anyway?\nGumshoe:\nUmm... December of last year, which I guess makes it last month.\nMaya:\nWhich makes it old news, you mean.\nPhoenix:\nBut I wasn't involved in a poisoning case in December!\nMaya:\nHmm, so what do you think this is all about, Nick?\nGumshoe:\nIf it wasn't you, pal, then that leaves only one possibility...\nMaya:\nNo way. You don't mean...\nPhoenix:\nA pho...\nMaya:\nA phony Nick!?\nPhoenix:\n(This must be Gumshoe's idea of a joke. Guess he's starting off the year with one, too...)\nMagazine Clipping added to the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\nSO!? What are you gonna do about it, pal!?\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean, what am I going to do about it?\nMaya:\nWell, it's your fault that the judge found the defendant guilty in this case!\nPhoenix:\nMy fault!? How do you figure that?\nMaya:\nBecause THE Phoenix Wright is super famous now! Well, maybe only sort of...\nGumshoe:\nYeah. See what happens when you hotshots start getting too full of yourselves?\nPhoenix:\n(But I didn't do anything wrong! ...At least, not that I can remember...)\nGumshoe:\nYou better make this right, pal. Now! And that means taking the case back to court. Got it?\nMaya:\nSounds like we've got our first case of the new year! Let's tackle it with gusto!\nPhoenix:\nI don't know... The judge already issued a guilty verdict once in this case. It's not going to be easy to get it overturned.\nMaya:\n... I guess that New Year's resolution is going to have to wait until next year.\nGumshoe:\nSo you're taking the case, right!? Good! I'm gonna head over to the courthouse then. After that, I'll go back to the precinct. Drop by if you need something, OK pal!?\nPhoenix:\n(I guess people are starting to know the name \"Phoenix Wright\". If a client entrusted a case to me based on my reputation... I guess I am kind of responsible. But why would someone want to impersonate me? What sort of a guy would do that?)\nJanuary 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept.\nMaya:\nIt's been ages since we came down to the precinct, huh, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nLooks like Gumshoe isn't around.\nMaya:\nHe's got it so easy, leaving everyone else to do the work!\nPhoenix:\nNo, he's been out there somewhere. My bet is on the courthouse. He's probably trying to arrange the retrial of this case.\nMaya:\nGuess that means we should go to the detention center and chat with our killer, huh?\nPhoenix:\nAfter being convicted without a fair trial, I'm not sure killer is the right label...\nJanuary 6Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nMaya:\nThis is so nerve-wracking, waiting to meet our new client. I wonder just what kind of person you tricked and got found guilty...?\nPhoenix:\nK-Keep it down, Maya! That kind of talk could ruin me!\n???:\nAaaaaaaah! How could you, Mr. Wright!? How could you do this to me!? They put me in solitary! I haven't been able to stop crying.\nPhoenix:\nA-Aren't... you...\n???:\nYes, I am! I am totally and utterly let down!\nMaya:\nAah! You're... Are you...?\n???\nDon't pretend you don't know me! It's me, Maggey, remember!? Maggey Byrde!\nPhoenix:\nMaggey Byrde... Ah! (Maggey Byrde... She's the policewoman I defended that one time. She was accused of murdering her lover. He was a cop, too.) What are you doing in here!? Didn't I get you acquitt--\nByrde:\nOh, sure! Very funny! After that fifth-rate defense job, you come in here and start making jokes!?\nMaya:\nYou better hurry up and tell her what happened, Nick.\nByrde:\nO-Oh... I see...\nPhoenix:\nSo that's where we stand right now.\nMaya:\nI'm sorry you've been caught up in another murder...\nByrde:\nMy whole life has been nothing but a whirlwind of bad luck and failures.\nPhoenix:\n(I vaguely remember her saying the exact same thing last time...)\nByrde:\nBut I don't mind! What's one more disaster in my life? At least now the real Mr. Wright is here with me. I won't let the world keep me down, sir!\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Magazine Clipping:\nByrde:\nMr. Wright... Do you think it's possible to get a retrial?\nPhoenix:\nProbably. The court ruled in the absence of a genuine defense attorney. So we should be able to get a retrial.\nByrde:\nUm... Mr. Wright...?\nPhoenix:\n?\nByrde:\nDo you think we'll win next time? ...Sir?\nPhoenix:\n...!\nByrde:\nMy life has been a full course meal of bad luck, complete with defeat for dessert. Since I was 6 months old, when I fell from the 9th floor of my apartment building... ...I've been hit by all sorts of vehicles, gotten sick from all sorts of foods... ...failed at almost every test I've taken, experienced almost every kind of disaster... I even landed a phony lawyer when I had the misfortune of being accused of murder. But! I will survive! Because Maggey Byrde always lives to fight another day! And one day, I'll find it! Just you wait and see, sir! I'll find that one, single moment of good luck!\nMaya:\nArgh, Xin Eohp is really gonna pay for this!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What are you staring at me like that for...? (But Maya's right... Whoever it is that thought it was a good idea to use my name... ...and get an innocent girl convicted of murder had better watch out!)\nMaya:\nWe'll find him! Don't you worry. We'll get Xin Eohp for you!\nByrde:\nThank you! Oh! I'll tell you where Trés Bien is then!\nPhoenix:\nTrés... Ah, right. The restaurant where the murder took place.\nByrde:\nYes, sir. When you go, please tell Mr. Armstrong I said hi!\nMaya:\nSure! Alright, Nick! Let's go check out this restaurant and its food!\nJanuary 6Trés Bien\nMaya:\nWow! Look at this place.\nPhoenix:\n\"Look\"? More like \"smell\"... What is with the suffocating scent of flowers in here...? Then again, girls like that sort of thing, right?\nMaya:\nActually, I'm not all that into it...\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\n... No one's coming to seat us. Maybe there's no one here.\nPhoenix:\nDon't be silly, Maya. This is a restaurant, and it's open for business. HELLO! ANYONE HERE? ... I don't believe it! There really isn't anyone here!\nMaya:\nPerfect! Let's get intrusive! If there's no one here, we can take anything we want!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, I suppose we can...)\nWright & Co. Law Offices\nDetention Center\nAfter presenting Sports Paper in Detention Center - Visitor's Room:\nJanuary 6Trés Bien\n???:\nOh là là! Bon-JOUR! Welcome to la Trés Bien!\nMaya:\nOh! Hel... lo... ...\nPhoenix:\n(What happened to Maya? She's frozen stiff...)\n???:\nBienvenue! Welcome to my petite restauranté!\nMaya:\nHuh? \"Bee Avenue\"?\n???:\nOh, non, my petite chulip!\nMaya:\nHuh? Me?\n???:\nLook at z'is face! Like la kitten rejected by its own mother. You are fatigued, non? Alors! You need z'is! An aromatic bath oil mélange of la néroli and la rose. My personal recommendation!\nMaya:\nYou think I need what...?\n???:\nOui, oui! Just add a couple of drops of z'is mixture to la bath water, and voilá! It will soothe your body and your mind. It's simply fantastique!\nMaya:\nReally?\n???:\nAnd for la monsieur!\nPhoenix:\nWho?

If you will be seated, I will bring you la special menu of z'e day!\nPhoenix:\nActually, we're not here to eat. We're lawyers.\n???:\nMais bien sûr! I know z'is already, monsieur. You are la Phoenix Wright, non?\nPhoenix:\nUm, yes... You know me?\n???:\nMais, oui oui! I never forget a man who flirts wiz me! Especially in court!\nMaya:\nI guess he was cross-examined by our mysterious Xin Eohp...\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like everyone to do with this case knows who \"I\" am already.\nMaya:\nI wonder what sort of impression Xin Eohp's been leaving on people, don't you?\nArmstrong:\nAllow me to introduce myself to you again. I am Jean Armstrong. Enchanté!\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\nUm, Mr. Armstrong... Could I just confirm something with you again? The table where the victim was sitting... Was anyone else sitting there?\nArmstrong:\n... Z'at is a question you will 'ave to ask 'im yourselves.\nMaya:\nHuh? \"'Im\"?\nArmstrong:\nLa old man spends all of 'is time dans la parc.\nPhoenix:\nLa p-parc? Oh, a park? What park's that?\nArmstrong:\nBehind la restaurant. It is called, \"Vitamin Square\".\nMaya:\nThank you!\nArmstrong:\nJe vous en prie, my dear!\nMaya:\nLet's go check out this Vitamin Square right now, Nick!\nJanuary 6Vitamin Square\nMaya:\nSo this is Vitamin Square.\nPhoenix:\nYeah. I see where they get the name from now. The fruits scream \"VITAMINS!\" at you.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! That's the guy, right? Isn't that the old man Mr. Armstrong was talking about?\nPhoenix:\nThat grouchy-looking grandpa?\nMaya:\nHe's throwing seeds out for the pigeons.\nPhoenix:\nMaya, he's not throwing seeds for them, he's throwing seeds AT them!\nOld Man:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh... My grumpiness-threat level has just been raised to red...)\nDetention Center\nTrés Bien\nVitamin Square\nAfter presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien:\nJanuary 6Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\nLooks like they have Maggey in questioning. I guess I've asked her pretty much everything... I'll come back if there's anything else I need to ask her later.\nAfter presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien:\nJanuary 6Wright & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nPoor Maya. It looks like Mr. Armstrong's really taken a shine to her. I suppose I'll just have to let her work at the restaurant for a while. I'll go pick her up from Trés Bien once things have cooled off.\nAfter presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien:\nJanuary 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept.\nGumshoe:\nWell, pal!? Have you found the evidence yet!? The one that's gonna find her innocent!?\nPhoenix:\nUm, no. Not yet. We've only just started our investigation.\nGumshoe:\nWell, whatever you need to know, I'll give you the dirt on it. I'm putting off all my other cases for now, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(Gumshoe's really fired up about this...)\nGumshoe:\nOh, yeah! One more thing! The retrial's been approved. Court's sitting at 10 AM tomorrow. And Godot's gonna be the prosecutor...\nPhoenix:\n(Oh. ... Him.)\nGumshoe:\nNow, listen up, pal! If Maggey's found guilty again...\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes...?\nGumshoe:\nUm... I'll... I'll make sure you get locked up good for it, got it!?\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Sports Paper in Police Station - Criminal Affairs Dept.:\nJanuary 6Trés Bien\nPhoenix:\nThe scent of flowers sure is strong. It's almost making me dizzy... Oh, um... Hello. (Who was that just now? A customer? She had sort of a dark aura about her...)\n???:\nAh! Welcome! Bee avenue!\nPhoenix:\n(Wow. What a cute voice.)\nMaya:\nOh, it's just you, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nM-Maya!\nMaya:\nWell? How do I look?\nPhoenix:\n... Maybe you should quit being a spirit medium...\nMaya:\nMaybe. But it's kind of boring being a waitress. I mean, you're my first ever customer.\nPhoenix:\n(Then who was that woman I just saw?)\nMaya:\nOh, oh! Since you're here, you might as well have something to eat!\nPhoenix:\n... I am kind of hungry, actually.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\nUm... About the lunch...\nMaya:\nOh! A fine choice, sir.\nPhoenix:\nNo. I, um...\nMaya:\nKITCHEN! A LUNCH SPECIAL, PLEASE! WITH ALL THE EXTRAS: DRINK, SIDE SALAD, DESSERT, AND GIFT!\nPhoenix:\nI don't need any of that!\nMaya:\nJust a moment, please, sir.\nPhoenix:\n(Maya's really getting into this! So how much is this set lunch, then? 20 dollars, huh? But with the drink, side salad, and dessert, it's... 45 dollars!?) Hey, wait a sec! Maya!\nMaya:\nSorry to keep you waiting, sir! Here you are, our deluxe Fortify lunch set!\nPhoenix:\nWhoa!\nMaya:\nA dish inspired by lobster and abalone fricassée with balsamic vinaigrette. Bon appétit!\nPhoenix:\nUm, thanks...?\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! Hurry up and try it already!\nPhoenix:\n(Lobster, huh? Alright... Down the hatch it goes...) ... Urp!\nMaya:\nWell?\nPhoenix:\nAre you hungry, Maya?\nMaya:\nI'm starving!\nPhoenix:\nHere. It's yours.\nMaya:\nReally!? ... Urp!\nPhoenix:\nRemember, Maya. My wallet doesn't print money, so you'd better polish off that plate!\nMaya:\n... I-I've just remembered! I've got to clean the toilets!\nPhoenix:\nHey! (You can't be in that much of a hurry to clean the toilets!)\nTrés Bien Lunch Special added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nHow does that guy manage to make good food taste so bad?\nMaya:\nHey, Nick... You want to take a peek at the kitchen?\nPhoenix:\n(The kitchen, huh? Not a bad idea.)\nAfter clearing \"Kitchen\" Talk option in Trés Bien:\nJanuary 6Trés BienKitchen\nMaya:\nAnd here it is! The famous Trés Bien kitchen! It's my first time in here too, actually.\nPhoenix:\n... There is a weird atmosphere in here, that's for sure.\nMaya:\nMr. Armstrong will be back soon, so we'd better search quickly! Chop, chop!\nAfter examining oil bottles in Trés Bien - Kitchen:\nJanuary 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept.\nGumshoe:\nHey, you're just in time!\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nThe lab got back to me about that newspaper you gave me.\nPhoenix:\n(He must mean this sports paper with the memo scribbled on it...) So? What did they say? Did the analysis turn up anything?\nGumshoe:\nThey said the doodle was written by the victim, Glen Elg. No doubt about it.\nPhoenix:\n(I expected as much...)\nGumshoe:\nThe victim took the paper with him to the restaurant on the day of the murder. That's our best interpretation of the facts at the moment.\nSports Paper refiled into the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\n\"MC Bomber\"... I get the feeling I've heard that name somewhere before... Oh, well. I guess it'll come back to me. Don't forget to report back to me with whatever you find in the restaurant, OK, pal?\nPhoenix:\n(Since when did I start taking orders from Gumshoe...? Although... I get the feeling there's something I need to show him...)\nAfter examining table in Trés Bien - Kitchen:\nJanuary 6Vitamin Square\nPhoenix:\nHmm, the old guy's not here anymore. (Drat. And I still have some unanswered questions for him.)\nPhoenix:\nA scooter, huh? Who'd leave it right in the middle of the park like this? The wheel guard and the light are busted... I guess it must have been in an accident. It's totally wrecked.\n???:\nGwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar!

He \"fed\" me as well. I got a bunch of those seeds in my eyes.\nMaya:\nOoh, ouch!\nPhoenix:\nHey, Maya. Would you mind coming with me for a while?\nMaya:\nHuh? Me? Why?\nPhoenix:\nThere's something I really want to ask that old man.\nMaya:\nSure, OK. I'll just get changed.\nPhoenix:\nNo, hang on! Can't you... go like that?\nMaya:\n...

I'm Victor. Victor Kudo.\nPhoenix:\n(Even from beyond the grave... Wow...)\nMia:\nWhatever did Mr. Armstrong do!?\nKudo:\nOh, no! Those eyes! I can't take this!\nPhoenix:\n(Mia's really got this guy eating out of her hand...)\nKudo:\nHe steals things. From his customers.\nPhoenix:\nFrom his customers?\nKudo:\nGloves, handkerchiefs... Little things, mainly. He's a pilferer! So you be careful around him, my dear.\nMia:\nAre you sure about this?\nKudo:\nOf course! He was arrested for it once. I was there when it happened, having my javaccino.\nPhoenix:\n(He really is a regular!)\nKudo:\nLet me write you a little haiku about it.\nPhoenix:\nA haiku?\nKudo:\nA Japanese poem. It'll explain all you need to know about that chef.\nVictor's Note added to the Court Record.\nKudo:\nIf he takes anything again, you let me know! If it's not too expensive, I'll buy you a replacement!\nPhoenix:\n(Poor guy. He couldn't do enough for Mia.)\nMia:\nOK, Phoenix. That's about as much as I can do to help.\nPhoenix:\nThanks, Mia. We got some really important information thanks to you.\nMia:\nHonestly! I can't believe Maya called me for something like this!\nCriminal Affairs Dept.\nAfter clearing \"Armstrong's secret\" Talk option in Police Station - Criminal Affairs Dept. and clearing \"Armstrong's record\" Talk option in Vitamin Square:\nJanuary 6Trés Bien\nMaya:\nI guess it's about time to wrap up today's investigation.\nPhoenix:\nHad enough of being a waitress?\nMaya:\nYeah. Plus, no one came to the restaurant...\nArmstrong:\nOh là là! Mademoiselle Maya! Non! 'Ow can you leave like z'is!?\nMaya:\nI-I'm sorry...\nPhoenix:\n(That reminds me. Mr. Armstrong had a Psyche-Lock or three, didn't he? I'm going to have to break those...) Mr. Armstrong. I hope you won't mind, but I'd like to have another word with you...\nArmstrong:\nVolontiers! Of course!\nArmstrong:\nI did not take it! La ticket for 'alf a million, I mean.\nMaya:\nBut you just told us you did! You said you took a ticket!\nArmstrong:\nMais non, ma fille! It was not...\n???:\nThat's enough.\nMaya:\nHuh? AAAAAAAAAH! Mr. Godot!\nPhoenix:\nWhat in the heck are you doing here!?\nGodot:\nUrgh! This is without doubt... the worst coffee I have ever tasted, Mr. Armstrong.\nPhoenix:\n(He came in here for coffee!? Does his craving for coffee know no bounds!?)\nGodot:\nPerhaps Mr. Armstrong stole one of the victim's tickets on the day in question.\nArmstrong:\nI am la air'ead, non? Just a pretty little girl who everyone is laughing at.\nMaya:\nBut, in that case, Maggey shouldn't be the only one under suspicion...\nGodot:\nHe had the wrong ticket.\nPhoenix:\n...What?\nGodot:\nMr. Armstrong made off with the winning ticket's pretty neighbor.\nMaya:\nSo... the ticket he took was worthless?\nGodot:\nNot quite. He did win something. A dollar.\nArmstrong:\nYou see! I am just a pretty face! W'izout my looks, I 'ave nothing!\nPhoenix:\nSo... What happened to the winning ticket, then? The one he meant to steal.\nGodot:\nIndeed. What did happen to it? I don't like spoiling myself by watching trailers, so... ...we'll just wait and see how the movie turns out tomorrow, won't we?\nMaya:\nNngh...\nArmstrong:\nVoilà! You two! Time to laugh at la pretty little air'ead!\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like I won't be needing this note anymore.)\nVictor's Note thrown into the trash.\nPhoenix:\nLooks like we've got a new mystery now. Namely, where did the winning ticket go?\nMaya:\nI've got a bad feeling about this.\nPhoenix:\nWell, anyway. We can't let Maggey suffer any longer for this. And certainly not again.\nTo be continued.\n\nJanuary 7, 9:48 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1\nByrde:\nOh... I see... I guess I should've expected this. Nobody saw the other guy, huh?

How're you feeling!?\nByrde:\n...As if you need to ask either question, sir.\nGumshoe:\nDon't let 'em get you down, Maggey. And don't forget to eat well, OK?\nByrde:\nRoger!\nGumshoe:\nAnd you!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes?\nGumshoe:\nYou'd better square this case away, got it pal!? Maggey's innocent, you hear!? If you screw up, then I'll be doing some squaring away myself. Squaring away some paperwork for your arrest!\nPhoenix:\n(I-I think he's serious!)\nMaya:\nHey, Detective! You're on our side for once, right?\nGumshoe:\nYup.\nMaya:\nSo you'll be able to help Maggey out, right?\nByrde:\nReally? Can you, sir!?\nGumshoe:\nO... Of course! I've got the simulation under control! I'm gonna be the first witness on the stand today. If something I say doesn't mesh with the facts, make sure you point it out, alright?\nPhoenix:\nS-Sure.\nGumshoe:\nOK. We're forming a united front today, pal. You get me!?\nByrde:\nI can't tell you how grateful I am, sir! I've always admired you so much, Detective. I know I can count on you.\nMaya:\nLooks like it should all go pretty smoothly today, huh?\nPhoenix:\n(I can only wish...)\nJanuary 7, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4\nJudge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Maggey Byrde.\nPhoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.\nGodot:\n... Aaah, bitter!\nJudge:\nMr... Um... Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nAaaah!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What's wrong!?\nJudge:\nNothing. It's just whenever I addressed you in the previous trial, your response was... \"Youse talkin' to me!?\" It was a little, well... intimidating.\nPhoenix:\nNo, no! That wasn't me. That was the phony Phoenix.\nJudge:\nI see. So our trusty Phoenix Wright is back with us now, is he?\nPhoenix:\n(\"Our trusty\"...?)\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Godot. Your opening statement, please.\nGodot:\nMr. Trite... Whether you're a fake or the real deal... We will find out soon enough through this trial today.\nPhoenix:\nBut I can already tell you! I'm the real Phoenix Wright!\nGodot:\nI wasn't questioning whether you are Phoenix Wright or not. I was questioning whether you had studied law or not. That's what I intend to find out.\nPhoenix:\n(There's no denying it. Behind that mask is a man who really hates me for some reason or another!)\nJudge:\nAs everyone is aware, the court has already given its verdict on this case once. Therefore, I won't stand for irrelevant testimony during this retrial. Nor will I stand for a simple repetition of the evidence presented in the last trial.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not planning on repeating anything that phony me said! Trust me!)\nJudge:\nNow then. Mr. Godot, please summon your first witness.\nGodot:\nLet's start with the formalities, shall we? Name and occupation?\nGumshoe:\n...\nJudge:\nWitness! State your name for the court!\nGumshoe:\nHuh? Oh, sorry, sir! The name's Police Department Detective. Occupation, Dick Gumshoe.\nGodot:\nOther way around, Detective.\nGumshoe:\nHuh? Oh! Sorry. Anyway, I'm the officer in charge of this case since yesterday. Sir!\nJudge:\nSince yesterday?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. The guy who was on the initial investigation's tied up with another case now.\nMaya:\nI hope Gumshoe's really got everything under control... For everyone's sake.\nJudge:\nI see. So, Detective Gumshoe... Would you outline for the court the basic facts of the case?\nGumshoe:\nY-Y-Yes, sir. The victim's name was Glen Elg. He was a professional programmer. He was on the payroll of Blue Screens Inc., a local company. This is the victim's autopsy report.\nJudge:\nThe court accepts this into evidence.\nGlen's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\nUm... And here are the floor plans of the restaurant. When the incident took place, the victim was sitting right here. The poisoned coffee was brought over to him by the, um... By the waitress.\nJudge:\nThe waitress being the accused?\nGumshoe:\nYeah... The victim died from poisoning almost immediately after he took a sip of the coffee. At the time of the incident, there were two other people in the restaurant. Mr. Jean Armstrong, the owner and chef. And a regular by the name of Mr. Victor Kudo.\nJudge:\nHmm... It still seems to be a very straightforward case to me.\nTrés Bien Floor Plans added to the Court Record.\nGodot:\nCome, Detective. Take up this hammer. And nail the defendant's coffin shut with your own two hands.\nJudge:\nNow then, Detective Gumshoe. Let's have your testimony.\nGumshoe:\nUmm... Yes, sir...\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Incident --\nGumshoe:\nWhen the incident took place, the victim was alone at his table, sir.\nWe understand that the guy, Glen Elg, was listening to the radio at the time.\nTraces of poison were found in his coffee cup.\nAnd what we found was potassium cyanide. That stuff really packs a punch!\nAnd, um... it looks like Ms. Byrde might've had, well... some kind of a motive.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nGodot:\nUsing the dark, aromatic depths of coffee to conceal the poison... Classy lady!\nJudge:\nThe facts of this case seem to be ironclad. Mr. Wright. I would ask you to begin your cross-examination, but...\nPhoenix:\nYes?\nJudge:\nPlease, no intimidation tricks this time around. Is that understood?\nPhoenix:\nI already told you! That wasn't me!\nCross Examination\n-- The Incident --\nGumshoe:\nWhen the incident took place, the victim was alone at his table, sir.\nGumshoe:\nWe understand that the guy, Glen Elg, was listening to the radio at the time.\nGumshoe:\nTraces of poison were found in his coffee cup.\nGumshoe:\nAnd what we found was potassium cyanide. That stuff really packs a punch!\nGumshoe:\nAnd, um... it looks like Ms. Byrde might've had, well... some kind of a motive.\nMaya:\nYou really think there are any contradictions in this testimony?\nPhoenix:\nTo be honest, I don't know.\nMaya:\nBut Gumshoe told us out in the lobby. He said we'd be forming a united front, right? How will we win the case if he doesn't throw us a line?\nPhoenix:\n(I don't have a whole lot of options right now... The best I can do is gather the facts together, I guess.)\nAfter selecting \"Press harder\" upon pressing first, third, and fifth statements:\nJudge:\nThat's enough! The facts of this case seem overwhelmingly clear to me. The defendant had ample opportunity to commit the crime of which she is charged. Furthermore, it seems beyond reasonable doubt that she did indeed commit this crime.\nGodot:\nI like an old man who knows the score.\nJudge:\nThere is also the matter of the half a million dollar lottery ticket. That alone provides a very credible motive. I mean, for that sum of money even I might be tempted to bend the rules!\nGodot:\nI don't mind an old man who is weak to the siren call of money.\nMaya:\nNot good, Nick... The evidence against Maggey is starting to pile up fast.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, that's because the court has ruled guilty once already.\nGodot:\nI'd say it's about time to wrap up this repeat performance... ...with one final, decisive piece of evidence.\nPhoenix:\n(He's got more evidence against Maggey!?)\nGodot:\nThis is the apron the delightful Ms. Byrde was wearing at the time.\nMaya:\nWow... That's not the cleanest apron I've seen...\nPhoenix:\nTh-That stain looks like...! (It can't be... blood, can it!?)\nGodot:\nHa...! It seems the star of our play was a little flustered... And somehow spilled coffee on herself.\nPhoenix:\nThe coffee!? That's not exactly the first thing that caught my eye...\nGodot:\nOf course. The coffee stain isn't the most interesting thing about this apron. No, there's something else that stands out even more.\nJudge:\nSomething else? I presume you mean...\nGodot:\nOf course. I'm referring to the pocket.\nPhoenix:\nThe... pocket?\nGodot:\nA search carried out right after the incident uncovered this... Potassium cyanide. The very poison used by the killer, was in her apron pocket!\nPhoenix:\nA bottle of poison... In Maggey's pocket?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. And Maggey's prints were the only ones on it.\nPhoenix:\nWHAAAT!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order! The court will accept these items into evidence.\nApron added to the Court Record.\nPotassium Cyanide added to the Court Record.\nJudge:\nThere's something still bothering me, Mr. Godot. Why have you not explained the bloodstain to the court?\nGodot:\nBloodstain? What bloodstain would that be?\nJudge:\nDon't play games, prosecutor! The blood-colored stain that's smeared all over the apron!\nGodot:\nThat's ridiculous! No one told me anything about a bloodstain!\nPhoenix:\n(You don't need to be told! Just look at it!)\nGodot:\nWell, Detective!? Could this stain really be... BLOOD!?\nGumshoe:\nN-No way, sir! That's... It's just ketchup. Sir.\nPhoenix:\nKetchup!?\nGumshoe:\nShe must've gotten some on her an apron while taking someone their breakfast that day.\nJudge:\n... You could have spoken up a little sooner, Detective Gumshoe!\nGodot:\nPull a stunt like that again, and I'll have you drink 17 cups of ketchup, witness!\nGumshoe:\nUnnngh... I thought everyone knew what it was already.\nJudge:\nHmm... I haven't seen anything yet to make me doubt the last verdict I ruled on this case.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nJudge:\nThe motive, the opportunity, and the supporting evidence... They have all been clearly established.\nGodot:\nWell, Trite... It seems you really are a phony after all.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh! You really know how to drive a man nuts!)\nJudge:\nWitness, please continue with your testimony. Describe for the court the crime scene and the findings of your investigation there.\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Investigation --\nGumshoe:\nThe crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.\nPoor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her.\nThe victim didn't have any identification on him.\nBut we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly.\nWhen Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison.\nAnd that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene.\nJudge:\nHmm... You identified the victim and secured your prime suspect... Very good.\nGodot:\nLast chance to convince the court you're a real lawyer, Trite!\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nDon't court on any more cross-examinations after this one! So, let the fun begin!\nCross Examination\n-- The Investigation --\nGumshoe:\nThe crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.\nGumshoe:\nPoor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her.\nGumshoe:\nThe victim didn't have any identification on him.\nGumshoe:\nBut we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly.\nGumshoe:\nWhen Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison.\nGumshoe:\nAnd that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene.\nPhoenix:\nIf I don't find a hole in this testimony, the judge is going to hand down his verdict!\nMaya:\nGumshoe isn't giving us anything to work with... And we can't find any contradictions if he doesn't give us something!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, that's true... But Maggey and Gumshoe are like dumb and dumber. Our only hope is that they were so dumb, they missed something obvious.\nMaya:\nCome on, Gumshoe! Be the dumbest you've ever been!\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe. I think I should point something out to you. There is just one small contradiction in your testimony.\nGumshoe:\nOho! Finally! I'm getting all anxious just waiting, so hurry up, will you?\nPhoenix:\nYou testified that, \"nothing else was missing from the crime scene.\" However! The prescription bag you mentioned was empty! Did the officers recover the medicine from the scene of the crime later?\nGumshoe:\nUm, no. They didn't.\nPhoenix:\nThe victim was given a prescription right before going to Trés Bien. Where, then, did the medicine disappear to!?\nGumshoe:\nY-You... ...are toooooo coool, pal!!\nJudge:\nI-Indeed! Due consideration wasn't given to the victim's prescription in the previous trial. Witness! Why do you always overlook such vital pieces of evidence!?\nGumshoe:\nI, er... I guess that's the most careless thing I've done so far, huh?\nPhoenix:\nThe victim was killed by poison! And the victim's \"medicine\" mysteriously disappeared! The victim's own prescription could have been the lethal poison itself!\nJudge:\nO-Order! Order! Well, Mr. Godot? What do you have to say to that?\nGodot:\nHa...! That's all.\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nGodot:\nRead for the court the name of the clinic on the prescription bag, if you will.\nPhoenix:\nWhat's the clinic's name got to do with anything...? \"New Ear Otolaryngological Clinic\" O-Otolaryngological?\nJudge:\nJust what kind of illness was the victim suffering from, Mr. Godot?\nGodot:\nHardly an illness, Your Honor. More like a bitter war wound, you could say.\nJudge:\nA war wound?\nGodot:\nThe day before the incident, Mr. Elg found himself in a fight. He took a blow to the side of the head, and ruptured his eardrum.\nPhoenix:\nHe ruptured his eardrum!?\nJudge:\nThen what on earth was the prescription he was given?\nGodot:\nIt was a cream that was to be applied topically inside his ear canal, not to be ingested!\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nGodot:\nIt's mentioned in the autopsy report, if you read the fine print. They found traces of the medication in the victim's left ear.\nJudge:\nYes. Here it is. In very, very fine print.\nGodot:\nIt seems Mr. Elg correctly applied some of his medication while he was at Trés Bien. Therefore, it would be absurd to believe that he would have eaten his medication.\nPhoenix:\nUuurgh...\nJudge:\nIt seems that this medication is irrelevant to the case after all.\nPhoenix:\nN-No...\nMaya:\nNick! If you don't think of something quick, it'll all be over!\nPhoenix:\n(She's right. But I can't get away with any old weak objection. What should I do...?)\nPhoenix:\nOnly moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement. \"It seems Mr. Elg correctly applied some of his medication while he was at Trés Bien.\" If that's the case, then why was the medication not found at the scene of the crime!?\nGodot:\n...!\nJudge:\nBut the medication in question was for topical use inside the ear canal!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThat doesn't change the fact that it could not be found at the crime scene! However insignificant it may seem, it's a lawyer's duty to pursue the truth!\nGodot:\nGodot:\nYou know as well as I do that the medication is irrelevant. It hardly seems likely that a prescription drug would contain potassium cyanide.\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nIt hardly seems likely that the coffee the waitress served would contain it, either! But it did! The possibility is undeniable!\nGodot:\nAaargh!\nJudge:\nThat's enough. Mr. Godot. Is the detective the only witness the prosecution wishes to call?\nGodot:\n...\nJudge:\nMr. Godot...?\nGodot:\n...\nGumshoe:\nUm... I, ah... I've got my own witness I'd like to call, sir. It's the old man who was there in the restaurant on the day of the murder.\nPhoenix:\n(Victor Kudo? The pigeon-hater?)\nJudge:\nVery well. The matter of the disappearing medication seems little more than trivial at best. However! It wasn't explored at all in the previous trial. And that is something that bothers me.\nMaya:\nYay! Good job, Nick!\nJudge:\nThe court will adjourn for a 10 minute recess. After which we will hear the prosecution's next witness.\nGodot:\nHa...! I suppose this means I'll just have to finish you off in my last 6 cups.\nJudge:\nCourt is adjourned for recess!\nJanuary 7, 11:03 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1\nMaya:\nPhew! That was close!\nPhoenix:\nTell me about it... I nearly died in there!\nByrde:\nThat's my line, sir!\nMaya:\nNo! It's my line! I think I really did die a little bit.\nByrde:\nLooks like we all nearly died in there... I can't believe Detective Gumshoe! How could he betray us like that!?\nMaya:\nHuh?\nByrde:\nHe said he'd help me. But he totally set me up!\nPhoenix:\nI don't think he meant to do that, Maggey. He was backed into a corner. I mean, the guy's got to do his job, right?\nByrde:\nIt's OK. I know all about lies and betrayal. I've had them my whole life. But it really hurt this time. It felt like someone punched me hard in the stomach! I hate that guy! I don't ever want to see him again!\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Gumshoe...)\nMaya:\nSo the next witness is going to be that old guy from the park, right?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. Mr. Kudo. Lover of waitress outfits and projectile seeds!\nByrde:\nI bet he's gonna be really stubborn. I mean, he's pretty set in his ways, you know?\nMaya:\nYeah, he's a big old grouch. Are you going to be able to handle him, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I can take whatever he throws at me. Even those never-ending bird seeds!\nJanuary 7, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4\nJudge:\nCourt will now reconvene for the trial of Maggey Byrde. Mr. Godot. Your next witness, please.\nGodot:\nThe prosecution calls the lucky old-timer who caught the show over a cup of coffee. Will the witness please take the stand.\nGodot:\nName and occupation, if you don't mind.\nKudo:\nThe name is Victor Kudo. Born and bred in the Land of the Rising Sun! Honor and duty are what make me. Mind you, I can be quite emotional at times, too.\nPhoenix:\nWe don't need to hear about that, Mr. Kudo. Just tell the court your occupation.\nKudo:\nMy occupation? Kah! Listen, young'un! How much call d'you think there is for kimono embroidery here!?\nPhoenix:\nKimono embroidery?\nKudo:\nThat's what I do! Or did, back in Japan. I embroidered family crests on kimonos! My ancestors were embroidering kimonos before this country even existed!\nMaya:\nWow, a real craftsman! They're a dying breed! Hey! Maybe he could embroider my costume sometime.\nKudo:\nAnyway, like I said. There's not much demand for that kind of thing here. So I had to take a job working the cash register at a burger joint... pretending to smile!\nPhoenix:\n(That burger joint would've been better off putting him in the kitchen...)\nJudge:\nNow then, witness. Were you in the restaurant at the time of the incident?\nKudo:\nOh, yes! I was eating some seeds over a cup of javaccino.\nJudge:\nSeeds?\nKudo:\nWhat do you think these are, hmm!?\nJudge:\nI-I see...\nGodot:\nSo you saw everything that happened, gramps?\nKudo:\nDid I!? Oh, yes! Oh, yes I did! I saw it all!\nGodot:\nThen please, tell the court. We're all ears.\nKudo:\nSure, sure. I'll tell you. I'll tell you every last detail!\nPhoenix:\n(He's really getting into this...)\nWitness Testimony\n-- What I Witnessed --\nKudo:\nThe young man was reading the sports paper.\nThe serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it!\nThe man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed.\nThat's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well!\nJudge:\nMr. Kudo. she is not a \"serving girl\". Please refer to her as a waitress.\nKudo:\nKah! You're as bad as the rest of them! All these newfangled words! What's wrong with old-fashioned ones, hmm!?\nJudge:\nN-Newfangled?\nKudo:\nAll this talk of \"radios\" and \"glasses\"! It's \"wireless\" and \"spectacles\", I tell you!\nJudge:\nE-Excuse me...\nKudo:\nListen to me, everyone! Don't forget the old values! Don't let the good old days slip away!\nJudge:\nWell, um... I think it's time to begin the cross-examination, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor.\nCross Examination\n-- What I Witnessed --\nKudo:\nThe young man was reading the sports paper.\nKudo:\nThe serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it!\nKudo:\nThere's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there.\nKudo:\nThe man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed.\nKudo:\nThat's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well!\nKudo:\nThere was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose.\nKudo:\nThere wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front.\nMaya:\nDo you think Old Seedy really saw Maggey do it?\nPhoenix:\nWell, he probably had his eye on the waitress the whole time. That's why he was there.\nMaya:\nBut he was there for the cute outfits, right? Not the waitress...\nPhoenix:\nI-I guess... (Hmm, she makes a good point though...)\nMaya:\nHey! Did I just say something clever?\nPhoenix:\nI wonder if the waitress Mr. Kudo saw really was Maggey...\nMaya:\nThat's what we have to figure out, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nMr. Kudo. I would like you to please take a look at this.\nKudo:\nKah! That filthy thing would suit filth like you just perfectly. Actually, it reminds me of what my grandson looks like, just after he's done eating.\nPhoenix:\nHave you ever seen this before?\nKudo:\nOf course I haven't! Do you think I'd forget something as dirty as that!? Hmm? Well? You half-witted clot!?\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\n...\n.........\nKudo:\nWh-What!? What is it!? Ever since I said, \"you half-witted clot\", there's been an eerie silence in here.\nPhoenix:\nMr. Kudo. This apron... ...is the apron worn by the defendant on the day of the poisoning!\nKudo:\nUh?\nPhoenix:\nAnd as you just said yourself... ...you wouldn't forget something like this. Which means, is you had really seen this apron before...\nKudo:\nEr...\nPhoenix:\nYes, you know what I'm getting at! You couldn't have possibly seen the waitress from the front!\nKudo:\n... Oops!\nJudge:\nWitness! You can't just \"oops\" your way out of this!\nGodot:\nHa...! Well, well... Looks like we finally have a genuine trial on our hands.\nPhoenix:\n...\nGodot:\nListen, Trite. Here are the facts. On the day of the incident, there was only one waitress in the restaurant.\nJudge:\nThat being the defendant, Ms. Maggey Byrde?\nGodot:\nExactly. And when that one waitress put the poison into the coffee cup... ...this old guy was watching!\nJudge:\nHmm... I hope you understand the gravity of the situation, Mr. Kudo. The fate of the defendant may rest on what you say you remember seeing.\nGodot:\nJust tell the court exactly what you saw, gramps.\nKudo:\nYou can rely on me, Captain! My noggin's in perfect working order. I can't remember a single occasion when I forgot what burger a customer wanted!\nMaya:\nHe can't remember? Probably more like he messes up so many times, he's blocking it out...\nJudge:\nVery well. Let's test just how good your memory and attention to detail is, Mr. Kudo. Tell us what you remember about the victim.\nWitness Testimony\n-- About the Victim --\nKudo:\nHe was another of those pesky young types, wearing a broken pair of spectacles.\nHe had a newspaper in his right hand, and the noisy brat kept rustling its pages!\nThe young man was listening to the wireless. I remember that well.\nThen the serving girl in question brought over the javaccino.\nThe little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip.\nJudge:\nThe testimony we have just heard was to test how credible the witness's memory is. It seems to me that he remembers the victim in a great deal of detail.\nKudo:\nOh, yes! I hate those you-know-what types who are so vague about everything!\nMaya:\nHow are we going to handle this, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nWe only need to do one thing. We just need to prove that the old man's memory is shot.\nMaya:\nJust trip him up, you mean? Isn't that kind of cruel?\nPhoenix:\n(I suppose... But it's what I do best.)\nCross Examination\n-- About the Victim --\nKudo:\nHe was another of those pesky young types, wearing a broken pair of spectacles.\nKudo:\nHe had a newspaper in his right hand, and the noisy brat kept rustling its pages!\nKudo:\nThe young man was listening to the wireless. I remember that well.\nKudo:\nThen the serving girl in question brought over the javaccino.\nKudo:\nThe little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip.\nPhoenix:\n(The whole point of this cross-examination is to establish just one thing... That this old guy's memory has more holes than a slice of Swiss.)\nMaya:\nI guess we just need to find a contradiction in his testimony somewhere, huh?\nPhoenix:\n(Anything will do. Even the smallest detail. We just need one mistake, and he's ours!)\nPhoenix:\nMr. Kudo. Do you remember what you were told at the start of this testimony? That this was a way of testing the credibility of your memory?\nKudo:\nI know, I know! There's nothing wrong with my memory, I tell you! Nothing! If I got anything wrong, I'll eat these seeds and sing the pigeon song!\nGodot:\nCare to tell us where this is going, Trite?\nPhoenix:\nAccording to Mr. Kudo, the victim was holding the paper in his right hand... ...while drinking coffee with his free hand, which would make that his left.\nKudo:\nKah! What is this? Kindergarten?\nPhoenix:\nBut I would like the court to please take a look at this.\nJudge:\nThat's the cup victim used, correct?\nPhoenix:\nYes, and on the rim, you'll notice the mark left by the victim's lips.\nJudge:\nYes. There is a stain left by the coffee.\nPhoenix:\nIf you consider where that stain is, you'll clearly see... ...that the victim was holding the cup in his right hand!\nKudo:\nBut how...?\nPhoenix:\nWell, Mr. Kudo. The court is waiting for your epic performance! You said you'd eat those seeds and sing the pigeon song!\nKudo:\nAaaargh!\nJudge:\nMr. Kudo... I'm afraid this is simply not acceptable. I think the witness had better go back to the park where he came from.\nKudo:\nWAAAAIT! If you think I'm going to stand here and listen to you tell me I'm mad, you're wrong! I don't care about that dirty coffee cup! I know what I saw!\nJudge:\nY-You still insist on your testimony?\nKudo:\nThat young brat was holding the cup in his left hand! Oh, yes. No question! I'm a good, law-abiding citizen, I am. It's that dead young hotbot and you, you spikey-haired yahoo, who are at fault!\nPhoenix:\n(Who, me!?)\nJudge:\nTh-Thank you, old man. We've heard quite enough from you already.\nKudo:\nDon't call me \"old man\", old man! Been around for 68 years, I have. You can't ignore me! LISTEN TO WHAT I'VE GOT TO SAAAAY!\nJudge:\nI'm sorry, Mr. Kudo, but...\nGodot:\nSure, why not hear a little more?\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Godot!\nGodot:\nBut this is my 16th cup of coffee... So this is your final stand.\nKudo:\nThank you, Captain! You can rely on Victor!\nWitness Testimony\n-- Left Hand or Right Hand --\nKudo:\nThe boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs.\nHe kept fiddling with it all the time.\nHe was fiddling with it just before he picked up the cup, too.\nAnd then he used the same hand to pick up the cup. His left hand!\nJudge:\nWe know that the victim was wearing an unusual monocle over his left eye.\nGodot:\nIt wasn't a monocle, Your Honor. It was a small computer monitor often used by programmers.\nJudge:\nA monitor? You mean, like a television screen!?\nGodot:\nThe inside of the lens is a screen that displays computer data. It's called an HMD. It's a common tool in the victim's line of work.\nKudo:\nHDTV, DVD, CD... All these newfangled letters drive me mad! But they don't matter. I know what I saw, and I'm telling the truth!\nPhoenix:\n(It's true... He doesn't seem to be lying.)\nKudo:\nAnd those are the facts, in good old black and white!\nCross Examination\n-- Left Hand or Right Hand --\nKudo:\nThe boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs.\nKudo:\nHe kept fiddling with it all the time.\nKudo:\nHe was fiddling with it just before he picked up the cup, too.\nKudo:\nAnd then he used the same hand to pick up the cup. His left hand!\nMaya:\nWell, Nick? What do you think?\nPhoenix:\nI think the guy's telling the truth. But even so... Something's not quite right.\nMaya:\nThen chuck evidence at him until he breaks!\nPhoenix:\n(But if he's not lying, there wouldn't be any contradictions in his testimony, right?)\nPhoenix:\nI'm not sure what the relevance of this is, but... Mr. Kudo! There is something very strange about your observations of the victim.\nKudo:\nWhat!?\nPhoenix:\nYou say he was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the HMD.\nKudo:\nNo question! You can lock me up if I'm wrong! It was his left ear, without a doubt! I could only see that side of his head from where I was sitting.\nPhoenix:\nI don't think so.\nKudo:\nWh-What did you say!?\nPhoenix:\nYou're no doubt unaware of this fact, Mr. Kudo. But the victim couldn't hear with his left ear! His eardrum was ruptured!\nKudo:\nEh?\nPhoenix:\nTraces of medication for his condition were found in his ear canal. That's right! It's impossible that the victim was wearing his earpiece in his left ear. Because he couldn't even hear in that ear!\nKudo:\n... Is that true, Captain?\nGodot:\n...It is.\nKudo:\n...Pi... Pi-Pi-Pigeon! Hm-hm-hmm... Pretty pigeon! Hm-hm-hmm...\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order!\nPhoenix:\nThis witness's testimony is completely unreliable! He only saw the witness from behind. And he claims the victim was wearing an earpiece when we know his eardrum was ruptured! Well, Mr. Godot!?\nGodot:\nAaaargh! A single drop of milk is all it takes to destroy the pure black magic in the cup! The old man... ...is my drop of milk!\nKudo:\nCaptain! Are you calling me a drip!?\nJudge:\nThis is the victim's coffee cup in which the potassium cyanide was found. The mark on the rim clearly shows that the victim picked it up with his right hand!\nKudo:\nI'll never back down! I know I'm right! The lad drank his javaccino with his left hand!\nGodot:\nLet me put you out of your misery... Clearly, the victim used both hands. He took a sip with the cup held in his right hand, and then switched to his left... That's what the old man saw!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nImpossible! The witness has already testified on numerous occasions... ...that the victim died immediately after taking just one sip of the coffee.\nGodot:\nGodot:\nWhich hand the victim used to pick up his cup is irrelevant, Your Honor. The facts still stand! With one hand or the other, Mr. Elg drank the poisoned coffee... ...Like this!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSadly, Mr. Godot, that doesn't wash! The point of this testimony was to establish whether the witness's memory was credible. And the results are clear! The testimony given by this witness is useless!\nGodot:\nPuuuurgh!\nJudge:\nI believe it is time to conclude today's proceedings. I am satisfied that the witness is not deceiving the court. But to be frank, his testimony is a farce!\nKudo:\nD-Did you have to be so frank!? Take that, you pompous old fogey!\nJudge:\nI'm sorry, Mr. Kudo. You can't reach me from there. I'm ordering the defense and the prosecution to investigate this case further. That is all for now. This court is adjourned!\n???:\nKudo:\nWAAAAIT! If we stop now, where does that leave me?\nJudge:\nLeave you, Mr. Kudo?\nKudo:\nThanks to that blue-suited young upstart over there... ...I'm just a bumbling old man who can't even dot his t's or cross his i's now!\nPhoenix:\n(How is your bad memory my fault!?)\nJudge:\nI'm sorry, Mr. Kudo, but there's nothing I can do.\nKudo:\nI've kept my mouth shut until now... ...but there's something else the court should know!\nGodot:\nWhat!?\nPhoenix:\nThere's more?\nKudo:\nTo be perfectly honest, it might not be anything. But I want another chance! I want another crack at you, you young shark!\nPhoenix:\nM-Me? (He's looking at me like I'm some sort of evil Shogun...)\nKudo:\nWell, everyone? What do you say to one final showdown? The final chapter in this eccentric old man's scrapbook!\nGodot:\nSorry, gramps... I've already had my 17th cup of coffee.\nKudo:\nWhat have you got to lose, Captain? I'll give you all the javaccino you want if you come to my house after the trial. (Changed from [I'll give you all the coffee you want if you come to my house after the trial.] in the original release) I may be 68 years old, but Victor Kudo is still a man!\nJudge:\nThat's enough, witness. I believe it will be quicker for the court to just hear your testimony.\nKudo:\nYou bet! Much, much quicker!\nMaya:\nI can't believe this is happening...\nKudo:\nHa ha ha! You better get ready, youngster!\nPhoenix:\nI get the picture! Just quit throwing those seeds at me, would you!? (He's gotta be using some sort of infinite ammo code with that box of seeds...)\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Final Showdown --\nKudo:\nFirst of all, I want to stress that this might be nothing. I'm not too sure of myself.\nThe young boy slumped over the table as soon as he took one sip of his javaccino...\nWell, the clumsy idiot upset the vase. He knocked it right over.\nIt broke, and the strip of cloth covering the table got completely soaked!\nWell!? How about that? Turned things upside-down, hmm?\nJudge:\n... Um... Is that all?\nKudo:\nYes, that's all. I remember it perfectly. Eh!? You're doubting me again? You're doubting a poor, defenseless old man!?\nJudge:\nN-No. We are not doubting you, Mr. Kudo.\nMaya:\nDon't you get the feeling there's a question hanging on everyone's lips, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. \"So what?\" probably! That's all I can think of, and I have to cross-examine this guy!\nKudo:\nYou're a birdbrain, that's why that's all you can think of!\nJudge:\nVery well... Mr. Wright. Your final cross-examination, please.\nCross Examination\n-- The Final Showdown --\nKudo:\nFirst of all, I want to stress that this might be nothing. I'm not too sure of myself.\nKudo:\nThe young boy slumped over the table as soon as he took one sip of his javaccino...\nKudo:\nWell, the clumsy idiot upset the vase. He knocked it right over.\nKudo:\nIt broke, and the strip of cloth covering the table got completely soaked!\nKudo:\nWell!? How about that? Turned things upside-down, hmm?\nPhoenix:\nHe's really giving you the evil eye, Maya.\nMaya:\nIt's you he's looking at, Nick, not me! It's like he's saying, \"I triple dog dare you to find a contradiction, young'un!\"\nPhoenix:\nI guess I'll just have to rise to the challenge then...\nPhoenix:\nMr. Kudo. This is a photograph of the crime scene.\nKudo:\nHmph! So what?\nPhoenix:\nLook carefully at the table. The vase is there... intact!\nKudo:\nHuh?\nPhoenix:\nLost your tongue, granddad?\nKudo:\n... I'm no granddad of yours, hop scotch!\nPhoenix:\nOw! Oooow!\nJudge:\nEnough! If you throw any more seeds in this courtroom, the cleaners will be here all night.\nKudo:\nAaaaaah!\nJudge:\n... What is it now?\nKudo:\nI just remembered something!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes...? Go on...\nKudo:\nThe broken vase... Ha ha! It was on my table!\nPhoenix:\nWha...?\nKudo:\nAh, well... You see... It startled me when that young lad collapsed. So I stood up. That must've been when it fell over. The vase on my table, I mean.\nJudge:\nThe vase on your table?\nKudo:\nAh ha ha! Yes, it was on my table! And that's how my groin came to be completely soaked.\n.........\nJudge:\n*sigh* Thank you, Mr. Kudo. You've certainly earned your kudos for today.\nKudo:\nEr, I'd like to ask a question now. Have I, er... Have I been any use at all?\nJudge:\nPerhaps that's something you should reflect on yourself, Mr. Kudo.\nKudo:\nAaaargh! WAIT! WAIT A MINUTE! If that's the case, there's more! I've got more to say! Oh, yes! I remember something else...\nJudge:\nBailiff! Escort the witness out of the courtroom!\nKudo:\nWAAAIT! LISTEN TO MEEEEEE!\nJudge:\nWell! We seem to have been considerably sidetracked. And I am still not in a position to deliver a verdict.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nJudge:\nThe defendant has not been positively identified as the waitress in question. Additionally, there are two disparities in the testimony we have heard thus far.\nPhoenix:\nThe mark on the coffee cup that the victim supposedly drank from with his left hand. And the earpiece which was inserted into his left ear, out of which he couldn't hear.\nMaya:\nWow, Nick! You did it!\nJudge:\nI therefore require both the defense and the prosecution to further investigate the facts.\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.\nGodot:\n...\nJudge:\nThere is one more thing before I call today's session to an end.\nPhoenix:\nO-One more thing, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nThe witness we just heard from... He is most insistent that his testimony should be of use. So he's summarized it accordingly into this statement.\nPhoenix:\nUm... OK...\nJudge:\nYou may each have a copy of it, if you wish.\nGodot:\nWhatever. The prosecution doesn't need props like that.\nMaya:\nGodot's really mad, huh?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. I would be, too.\nJudge:\nVery well. Here you are then, Mr. Wright. There are 3 copies. My own, yours, and Mr. Godot's.\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.\nVictor's Testimony added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\n(\"I'm sorry\"? This isn't a piece of testimony! More like a five year old's apology...)\nMaya:\nWhat the heck are we supposed to do with 3 copies...?\nJudge:\nThat is all. This court is adjourned!\nTo be continued.\n\nJanuary 7, 12:52 PMWright & Co. Law Offices\nMaya:\nSo how do you think the trial went this morning?\nPhoenix:\nHow do you think it went!?\nMaya:\nIt got a bit crazy in there. I just wonder if that killed our chances.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I guess it did get out of hand. Mr. Kudo's testimony did nothing to help us. Plus, now we don't even know the identity of the waitress who laced the coffee.\nMaya:\nAll we know is what old Mr. Kudo saw... The apron straps, and the ribbon.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that the victim was wearing an earpiece when his eardrum was ruptured.\nMaya:\nTalk about a terrifying case of contradictionitus.\nPhoenix:\nTime to play doctor and find ourselves a cure then, huh?\nMaya:\nYeah, we've gotta find one for Maggey, or she's going to have a terminal case of guilty!\nJanuary 7Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept.\nMaya:\nLooks like Gumshoe's not here.\nPhoenix:\nNever mind that.

Something big...)\nJanuary 7Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\nI guess Maggey's still in questioning.\nMaya:\nBut! But we've got questions to ask her, too! Magg-ey!

I know you can!\nMaya:\nHe's getting really worked up about something.\nGumshoe:\nNoooooo! That's the wrong number! Argh! Look like an \"8\" would have only netted me five bucks anyway! What a rip off!\nMaya:\nWhat's the problem, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nHuh!? Oh, it's you... I, uh... I was uh... Hah hah! I was just... Hah hah hah! I was just listening to the radio, pal.\nPhoenix:\nTo the radio?\nMaya:\nHey, Detective Gumshoe's having lunch here!\nPhoenix:\n(He is! And he's having the Twin-T set...)\nGumshoe:\nAha ha ha... What can I say...?\nJanuary 7Vitamin Square\nMaya:\nHmm... I don't see any sign of Mr. Kudo. Do you?\nPhoenix:\nMaybe he went to buy another ton of bird seeds. I was kind of hoping he wouldn't be here, anyway. At least, not for now. (Besides, any more seeds today and I'm liable to turn into a real phoenix!)\nJanuary 7Trés BienKitchen\nMaya:\nHuh? Mr. Armstrong's talking to someone.\n???:\nI'll be back next month.\nArmstrong:\nOui! Naturellement!

Isn't that the same device as Glen Elg's?)\nMaya:\nThat's an [sic] DMH, right?\nPhoenix:\nNice try, but it's the other way around, Maya. It's an HMD.\nBasil:\nAll of my programmers here at Blue Screens, Inc. are supplied with HMDs.\nMaya:\nThen do you write programs, too?\nBasil:\nNo. I just enjoy wearing this.\nMaya:\nThey ARE pretty cool!

We've got a big meeting starting in a bit.\nMaya:\nAbout Maggey's case, you mean?\nGumshoe:\nNo, that's pretty much wrapped up now... There's another big case going down at the moment, so she's been pushed aside...\nMaya:\nOK. Well, see you later then.\nGumshoe:\nBye!\nPhoenix:\n...\nGumshoe:\n......\nPhoenix:\n......... Y-You better get going, Detective, or you'll be late.\nGumshoe:\nActually, I, um... I've kinda got a favor to ask. It's a big one!\nPhoenix:\nA favor?\nGumshoe:\nYeah... It's for, um... Maggey, actually. I was kinda hoping... you'd give this to her for me.\nMaya:\nWhat is it?\nGumshoe:\nIt's a lunchbox. I got up early so I could make it. I've been real worried about her. She looked like she'd lost a lot of weight.\nMaya:\nDetective Gumshoe... ... How many weenies are in here!? There's not a person on earth who could down this much meat.\nGumshoe:\nYou think? I love weenies. I can't get enough of their tender juiciness. So will you give to her? It took me ages to make, so please say you will, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(I can't exactly say no, can I?)\nGumshoe's Lunchbox given to Maya to carry.\nMaya:\nMaybe I'll eat it myself if I get hungry!\nGumshoe:\nDon't forget, OK?

Come to think of it, that doesn't look like one of those aromatherapy bottles...)\nGumshoe:\nThis is the small bottle that turned up in Trés Bien's kitchen a couple of days ago.\nMaya:\nWow! Look at all these little bottles!\nPhoenix:\nOh! They're aromatherapy oils! He's got so many, they're overflowing onto the floor...\nMaya:\nHey, wait a minute... There's one bottle that's different from all the others.\nPhoenix:\nWell what do you know. And it doesn't have a label either.\nMaya:\nAnd... *sniff* It doesn't smell.\nGumshoe:\nWe finally got the analysis results back from the lab.\nMaya:\nSo!? What is it? Is it the poison?\nGumshoe:\nI'm afraid not, pal. It's... medication.\nMaya:\nMedication?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. For ears. Topical use only, apparently.\nPhoenix:\nFor ears? You mean...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. It's the medication Glen Elg was using for his ruptured eardrum!\nPhoenix:\n(What was Glen Elg's ear medicine doing in the kitchen...?)\nSmall Bottle refiled into the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nUm, what about the unidentified fingerprints? Anything on that?\nGumshoe:\nSomeone screwed up, so they only had time to analyze the contents of the bottle. Another hour and they might have gotten something on the prints, but...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... That's going to weaken its impact as a piece of evidence...)\nGumshoe:\nOK, pal! This is it! Make sure your defense is impregnable today, got it!?\nPhoenix:\n(Today's trial... I'm gonna expose that guy for what he's done, or my name isn't Phoenix Wright!)\nJanuary 8, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4\nJudge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Maggey Byrde.\nPhoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.\nGodot:\nReady and waiting as always, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nVery good. Then we'll get underway at once. Yesterday we heard the testimony of Mr. Victor Kudo. He claims to have witnessed the defendant putting a powder into the victim's coffee. However, the witness's testimony was plagued with a number of problems.\nGodot:\nThe mark on the rim of the cup shows that the victim drank from it with his right hand. But according to the old man's testimony, he picked it up with his left hand.\nJudge:\nThank you, Mr. Godot. Furthermore, according to the witness's account... ...the victim was listening to the radio with an earpiece in his left ear. Yet, the victim's left eardrum was ruptured, which made him effectively deaf in that ear.\nMaya:\nIt's amazing how many contradictions a single case can have, huh Nick?\nGodot:\nHa...! Allow me to enlighten you, Your Honor. The world, you see, keeps turning, and we must turn with it.\nJudge:\n... You've lost me already, Mr. Godot.\nGodot:\nDon't let the mysteries of yesterday mystify you today. Only losers think like that. You've got to change with the times! That's one of my rules!\nJudge:\nAre you implying that you've resolved these contradictions? You know the answers to these riddles!?\nGodot:\nThe old guy wasn't just throwing seed in here. He was throwing us off the scent. And today I'll prove it.\nJudge:\nVery well. Let the first witness take the stand!\nGodot:\nAnd you are?\nArmstrong:\nOh bonjour, everyone! I am Jean Armstrong. z'e owner and 'ead chef of la Trés Bien restaurant. Enchanté!\n.........\nJudge:\nForgive me for asking, witness, but... are you a woman?\nArmstrong:\nOh là là, monsieur! As you can see, I am la pert and perky gentleman, non?\nJudge:\nEr... Umm...\nGodot:\nOn the day of the incident, you were in Trés Bien's kitchen. Isn't that right?\nArmstrong:\nW'iz you monsieur...\nGodot:\n...?\nArmstrong:\n...everything feels right!\nGodot:\nHa...!\nPhoenix:\n(Wow, he's totally unfazed! Doesn't anything intimidate this guy...?)\nJudge:\nVery well. Your testimony please, witness. Please tell the court what happened that day at Trés Bien.\nArmstrong:\nOui! Volontiers!\nWitness Testimony\n-- At Trés Bien --\nArmstrong:\nWhen it all 'appened, z'ere were just two customers in my restaurant.\nI remember I was experimenting w'iz some new art deco z'at day.\nLike 'aving a large mirror between la tables, for example.\nOui! Per'aps z'at is what la old man was looking at.\nLa cup, la earpiece, and la glasses... 'E would 'ave seen everyz'ing in reverse, non?\nPhoenix:\nA m...m...m... MIRROR!?\nArmstrong:\nOui! Un grand mirror! La most enormous mirror!\nGodot:\nAnd suddenly, the mystery disappears! Like I said, the world keeps turning, so roll with it!\nJudge:\nHmm... That would explain the coffee cup and the earpiece conundrum... The mirror would have made everything appear back to front.\nPhoenix:\n(What the heck!? It's way too early in the morning for this to be happening to me!)\nJudge:\nNow then, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- At Trés Bien --\nArmstrong:\nWhen it all 'appened, z'ere were just two customers in my restaurant.\nArmstrong:\nI remember I was experimenting w'iz some new art deco z'at day.\nArmstrong:\nLike 'aving a large mirror between la tables, for example.\nArmstrong:\nOui! Per'aps z'at is what la old man was looking at.\nArmstrong:\nLa cup, la earpiece, and la glasses... 'E would 'ave seen everyz'ing in reverse, non?\nPhoenix:\n(It's kinda hard to believe everything's the fault of a mirror, but...)\nMaya:\nDo you think Old Seedy saw everything through a reflection...?\nPhoenix:\nIf he did, it would explain all the contradictions in his testimony.\nMaya:\nBut that just makes the situation worse for Maggey! There's gotta be something in that old man's testimony! We've just gotta dig deeper!\nPhoenix:\nThe coffee cup, the earpiece, and the HMD... Let's think back over Mr. Kudo's testimony for a second, shall we?\nKudo:\nThe boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs.\nKudo:\nNo question! You can lock me up if I'm wrong! It was his left ear, without a doubt!\nPhoenix:\nSo, to summarize... ...we were told both the HMD and the earpiece were on the victim's left side. Now, if Mr. Kudo saw all that as a reflection in a mirror... ...it means both the HMD and the earpiece were actually on the victim's right side.\nArmstrong:\nExactement! You see, monsieur. Now z'at you think about it, it is not so 'ard, non?\nPhoenix:\nUnfortunately, that's where we run into a monumental contradiction with the facts! If Mr. Kudo really did see everything in a mirror... ...why is it that the HMD is now on the wrong side of his head!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! ...Mr. Wright is correct! If the witness genuinely observed the victim reflected in a mirror... ...then we would expect the victim's eyepiece to have been over his right eye.\nGodot:\nGodot:\n...How bitter. Trite, you should have a taste of this bitterness. It'll calm you down in no time.\nPhoenix:\nA-Are we talking about your coffee... or something completely different...?\nGodot:\nYou don't understand the way the witness thinks.\nJudge:\nHow he thinks?\nGodot:\nYou remember this, I presume?\nPhoenix:\nThe \"I broke the vase... sorry\" apology lett-- I mean Mr. Kudo's sworn testimony?\nGodot:\nExactly. The old man has one very grievous habit... other than throwing seeds. The more of an impression something makes, the more muddled his mind makes it. And what's the most striking thing about Mr. Elg?\nJudge:\nClearly, it's the victim's eyepiece.\nGodot:\nAnd that's my point. The old man strikes again! Mr. Elg's HMD made a big impression on the old man. \"I saw the earpiece and those new-fangled spectacles he was wearing! Oh, yes! They were both on his left ear! Do you hear? His left ear!\" Ha...! Well, Trite?\nPhoenix:\nUrk... (That's the worst, but best impression of Kudo ever...)\nMaya:\nWow! I really thought he was Old Seedy for a minute there! Godot's good!\nJudge:\nEnough! I must agree that yesterday's witness was irresponsibly rash in much of his testimony.\nMaya:\nBad luck, Nick. Looks like the \"boil\" of a contradiction you found is just a \"rash\".\nGodot:\nA mirror can't be beaten by a handful of seeds, nor can it lie. So... What exactly was the old man looking at? Fill us in, Mr. Armstrong. Go on, tell the court. We're all ears.\nArmstrong:\nOui. I can explain. Please, if you will look at la plans of la restaurant.\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Mirror --\nArmstrong:\nAlors. Is everyone sitting comfortably?\nLa mirror, it was in z'e middle of la restaurant, dividing z'e two 'alves.\nZ'ere is only one seat from which you could 'ave seen an image of la victim.\nZ'at was la seat at z'e table next to la victim's. Z'at was where la old man was sitting.\nAfter la terrible incident occurred, I move la mirror so it was not in z'e way.\nBut naturally, I did not touch anything else!\nJudge:\nHmm... I see no problems with the explanation we have just heard. From the table next to the victim's, Mr. Kudo could have seen the victim in the mirror.\nArmstrong:\nWhat a naughty little coquette I am, confusing all z'e men like z'is!\nGodot:\nDon't worry about it. We can keep up, except for the guy breaking out in a cold sweat over there again.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh! I hate that guy!)\nJudge:\nYou said you didn't touch anything else apart from the mirror. Are you quite sure about that?\nArmstrong:\nVolontiers! Of course!\nJudge:\nVery well. Mr. Wright. Your cross-examination, if you please.\nCross Examination\n-- The Mirror --\nArmstrong:\nLa mirror, it was in z'e middle of la restaurant, dividing z'e two 'alves.\nArmstrong:\nZ'ere is only one seat from which you could 'ave seen an image of la victim.\nArmstrong:\nZ'at was la seat at z'e table next to la victim's. Z'at was where la old man was sitting.\nArmstrong:\nAfter la terrible incident occurred, I move la mirror so it was not in z'e way.\nArmstrong:\nBut naturally, I did not touch anything else!\nMaya:\nIt is pretty strange, though, isn't it? I mean, nobody mentioned anything about a really large mirror. You'd think someone would've, but Maggey didn't, and neither did Old Seedy.\nPhoenix:\nThen the only logical explanation is... ...that there was no mirror inside Trés Bien that day. (Now I've just got to prove it... Somehow...)\nPhoenix:\nThere is one thing that was clearly demonstrated by yesterday's testimony. Mr. Kudo broke the vase that was on the table where he was sitting. And yet! As the court can see, there is an unbroken vase on the table next to the victim! Why? Because Mr. Kudo was not, in fact, sitting at the table next to the victim at all!\nGodot:\nGodot:\nDon't be an idiot, Trite! That's impossible! That seat's the only one Kudo could've seen the victim's reflection from!\nPhoenix:\nExactly!\nGodot:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nThere is only one conclusion we can draw from this contradiction. There was no mirror in Trés Bien that day! Your testimony, Mr. Armstrong, is an elaborate lie!\nArmstrong:\nMon dieeeeeeeu!\nGodot:\nGodot:\nDon't try to confuse the court, Trite! Obviously, the witness cleaned up the vase... ...while the police were taking their time getting to the crime scene!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nUnfortunately, Mr. Godot, that doesn't quite work for me. Mr. Armstrong already testified to the contrary. In his own words... \"I did not touch anything else\" except the mirror!\nGodot:\nUr... urgh! ... Gaaaaaaaaargh!\nJudge:\nWell, witness? What do you have to say for yourself?\nArmstrong:\n*sniffle*\nPhoenix:\n(I was right! There was no mirror in the restaurant that day!)\nJudge:\nIn light of this revelation, we return back to the original problem. Why did the victim have an earpiece in an ear in which he couldn't hear?\nGodot:\nHa...! You only get one shot in life. There's no turning back. If you want to claim that the mirror wasn't there, Trite... ...then this problem is all yours. How do you explain what the old man saw?\nPhoenix:\n(If I can answer this, then I'll be that much closer to the truth! I can feel it!)\nMaya:\n...Are you going to be OK? Can you really solve this contradiction, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nThere's more than just this one contradiction, Maya.\nMaya:\nWhat do you mean?\nPhoenix:\nRemember what Maggey told us? \"There was another man at the victim's table.\" And, \"there was a sample CD on the victim's table.\" It all flies in the face of Mr. Kudo's testimony. (And I think I know the reason why nothing in this case is adding up.)\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Let's hear your answer.\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. The reason behind all the contradictions in Mr. Kudo's testimony is simple.\nPhoenix:\nThis case is riddled with contradictions. Yet, there is one very simple answer that clears them all up.\nJudge:\nA-And what is that?\nPhoenix:\nThe incident Mr. Kudo witnessed, and the incident the victim experienced... ...were two completely different events!\nGodot:\nWhat!?\nPhoenix:\nYes! The \"victim\" that Mr. Kudo saw wasn't Mr. Glen Elg at all! It was an imposter -- a phony pretending to be Mr. Elg! Obviously, unlike the victim, there was nothing wrong with the imposter's left eardrum. That's how he ended up wearing the earpiece in his left ear by mistake!\nGodot:\nPhwoooooooh!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Settle down, or I'll clear the courtroom!\nGodot:\nQuiet, gramps! Why don't you clear out of here, huh?\nJudge:\nWHAT DID YOU SAY!?\nGodot:\nTrite... Are you saying what Mr. Kudo saw was a set-up?\nPhoenix:\nYes. Someone pretended to be Glen Elg and acted out the whole coffee poisoning. All for the express purpose of creating a \"witness\" out of one Mr. Victor Kudo!\nGodot:\nGodot:\nGet real, Trite! Why would anyone want to do that?\nPhoenix:\nIsn't it obvious? The thing Mr. Kudo was most insistent about in his testimony was...\nKudo:\nThe serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it! That's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well!\nJudge:\nI-It's so hard to believe, but...\nPhoenix:\nThere was one, and only one reason to show Mr. Kudo this fake poisoning! To show Maggey Byrde in the act of poisoning the coffee!\nGodot:\nGodot:\nAre you insinuating that the waitress in the old man's story was a fake as well? It's true that there were no customers in the restaurant at the time, but... ...it's also true that the chef was there! He would have noticed what was happening.\nJudge:\nTh-That's right! Well, witness? If your restaurant really was the scene of such theatrics... ...you would have known about it, correct!?\nArmstrong:\nOh là là... Z'is is most difficult for me...\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nNo, it's quite simple. All you have to do is testify. You are under oath, after all. Was there, in fact, a phony at Trés Bien that day!? The defense demands that Mr. Armstrong tell the whole truth about what happened.\nJudge:\nThe defense's request for additional testimony is accepted. You will accurately explain, in detail, the events in the restaurant that day!\nArmstrong:\nOu... Oui.\nWitness Testimony\n-- In the Restaurant --\nArmstrong:\nLa victim, Monsieur Elg, 'e came to my restaurant alone.\nI remember la old man arrived not long after 'im.\nZ'ere were no other customers.\nWhen 'e got word 'e won la lottery, Mon. Elg became very excited.\nIt was approximately 5 minutes later z'at la poisoning incident occurred.\nNon, z'ere was no time for a phony to do la acting.\nJudge:\n...Just so we're clear, there was no mirror in the restaurant, after all?\nArmstrong:\nJe vous demande pardon! Forgive me, Your Honor! I lied because I wanted z'is mess to be cleared up quickly.\nJudge:\nWhat you have just done is commit perjury, Mr. Armstrong! I will decide how to punish you later.\nArmstrong:\nO-Oui...\nJudge:\nFor now, we will hear your cross-examination. Mr. Wright, if you please. (Changed from [For now, we will hear your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm.. He took that perjury charge a bit too well. But I'm guessing he'll be more serious trouble after this cross-examination!)\nCross Examination\n-- In the Restaurant --\nArmstrong:\nLa victim, Monsieur Elg, 'e came to my restaurant alone.\nArmstrong:\nI remember la old man arrived not long after 'im.\nArmstrong:\nI remember la old man arrived not long after 'im, just after 2 PM.\nArmstrong:\nZ'ere were no other customers.\nArmstrong:\nWhen 'e got word 'e won la lottery, Mon. Elg became very excited.\nArmstrong:\nIt was approximately 5 minutes later z'at la poisoning incident occurred.\nArmstrong:\nNon, z'ere was no time for a phony to do la acting.\nMaya:\nI guess Mr. Armstrong is connected to this case, huh?\nPhoenix:\nAbsolutely. Someone was impersonating Mr. Elg, and I refuse to believe he was oblivious. He was there the whole time, after all.\nMaya:\nBut if you're right, wouldn't Maggey have noticed, too?\nPhoenix:\nShe fell unconscious when the incident occurred, remember?\nMaya:\nAh! You mean that's when the phony staged his act?\nPhoenix:\nWe'll know for sure once I find a hole in this testimony.\nPhoenix:\nI'm afraid I've finally got you, Mr. Armstrong.\nArmstrong:\nQ-Quoi? What do you mean?\nPhoenix:\nAt the time in question, the victim was listening to the radio with his earpiece. The show he was listening to was \"Millionaire Radio\". Each week, they announce the winning number of a half million dollar lottery ticket.\nArmstrong:\nOui. Z'at must be la show Mon. Elg was listening to.\nJudge:\nI can't see any problem with this testimony, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nI wonder...\nArmstrong:\n...?\nPhoenix:\nYou say the victim arrived at your restaurant after 2 PM, correct?\nArmstrong:\nOui, oui. I am sure of it. I remember it perfectly now! I know it was z'at time, because I 'ad just finished serving la lunch menu.\nGodot:\nGet to the point, Trite. If you have one.\nPhoenix:\nThat show is broadcast live at 1:30 PM. And it claims to be \"the most thrilling 10 minutes of your life\"...\nJudge:\nI-It's on the air at 1:30!?\nPhoenix:\nNow, supposedly, the victim made some noise when it was announced that he had won. And yet... I don't believe his cry of joy could have occurred after 2 PM! Because the show had already finished more than 30 minutes earlier by that point in time!\nArmstrong:\nNooooooooon!\nPhoenix:\nThis \"victim\" we've been told about has done nothing but the impossible! Listening to the radio with a ruptured eardrum, catching a show that was already over... There is only one conclusion you can draw from these facts! This \"victim\" was an imposter, acting out the poisoning 30 minutes after the real murder! Yes, there were two Glen Elgs in Trés Bien that day. The real Glen Elg, now dead, having been poisoned by the real killer... ...and the phony Glen Elg, acting out the events for Mr. Kudo to witness!\nJudge:\nI-It certainly seems that way... I mean, if that wasn't the case, how could you explain the time discrepancy?\nGodot:\nGodot:\nQuite a performance, Trite. You were almost on a roll.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nBut sadly, you lack the rock hard foundation of rhythm to build your song!\nPhoenix:\n(...What is this? Music Theory 101?)\nGodot:\nLet's recap. According to your \"imaginative\" theory, it's now just after 2 PM... The phony Elg is performing a play for the benefit of Mr. Kudo. How do you explain then, where the real Glen Elg is!?\nPhoenix:\nI don't believe I have to spell this out for court! However! At that time, the real Glen Elg was already dead!\nJudge:\nThat's certainly the obvious conclusion.\nGodot:\nGodot:\nThank you, Trite. That's exactly what I was hoping you would say.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!?\nGodot:\nNow, I presume you can prove this theory of yours...? Can you explain where the missing corpse went to!?\nPhoenix:\nTh-The missing corpse...?\nGodot:\nAccording to the old man's testimony, there was only one other customer there. If that \"customer\" was the phony Glen Elg... ...then where did the killer hide the body of the real victim!?\nPhoenix:\nNaaaaaargh!\nJudge:\nThe prosecution has a valid point, Mr. Wright. If your theory is to stand up to examination by the court... ...you must provide us with proof by answering the prosecution's question. Where did the killer hide the body?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor...\nGodot:\nNo conjecture, Trite. Let's hear some facts for once. Show the court a piece of evidence that proves where the body was hidden!\nPhoenix:\nE-Evidence!?\nMaya:\nWh-What's with the intense pressure in here all of a sudden!?\nPhoenix:\n(I thought I had him with that contradiction. But he's turned it all around and backed me into a corner instead!)\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? The court will now hear the defense's theory and evidence. First, where was the body of the real Mr. Elg concealed?\nPhoenix:\nMr. Armstrong! Do you recognize this bottle?\nArmstrong:\nNon! Non, non, non! I 'ave never seen z'at ugly bottle before in my life! I only use la very best bottles, monsieur! Z'e 'ighest quality only for me!\nJudge:\nWhere was that bottle found, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nInterestingly enough, Your Honor. it was found in the kitchen of Trés Bien.\nArmstrong:\nEh? Quoi!? But I only ever use z'ese bottles for my aromatherapy oils.\nPhoenix:\nBut this bottle doesn't contain aromatherapy oil, Mr. Armstrong. No, it contains a medication.\nJudge:\nWhat kind of medication?\nPhoenix:\nI'm sure everyone remembers, don't they? That Mr. Elg visited an otolaryngological clinic, and was given medication that day!\nGodot:\nY-You can't be serious...\nPhoenix:\nThe defense had the contents of the bottle analyzed, and I have the lab results here! The contents of the bottle match the prescription that was given to Mr. Elg!\nGodot:\nBwooooar!\nPhoenix:\nGlen Elg's murderer hid the body in the restaurant kitchen. At which time, this bottle fell out of the victim's pocket. Mr. Armstrong! When the incident occurred, didn't you say you were in the kitchen?\nArmstrong:\nM-M-Mon dieu!\nPhoenix:\nYes, you know about what I'm about to say, It was YOU who hid the victim's body! You did a fine job pretending to defend my client, Maggey Byrde. However! You were setting her up to take the fall behind the poor girl's back!\nArmstrong:\nNooooooooon!\nJudge:\nO-Order! Order! This is an extraordinary development. Witness! Did you... Did you murder Mr. Glen Elg?\nArmstrong:\nNever! I could not do such an 'orrible thing!\nGodot:\nNoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Godot!?\nGodot:\n...The bitterness... Every time I get lied to, I always down a mug of coffee. ...That's one of my rules.\nPhoenix:\n(Do you have the slightest idea how many cups you've had by now...?)\nGodot:\nThen I like to do the same to the person who lied to me. I like to take them down with my empty cup! Listen up, chef! How about a brand new flavor in your ear, my \"h\" deficient friend?\nArmstrong:\nJe vous demande pardon! Please, you must 'ear me out! It is a trap! Listen to me! Por favor!\nJudge:\nYo hablo Español, Mr. Armstrong, and \"Por favor\" is Spanish.\nGodot:\nI'm only going to ask you once. Did you do it?\nArmstrong:\nNon! Non, non! Absolutely non! I simply... I...\nGodot:\nLet's hear it. You've got one shot. Right, gramps?\nJudge:\nWitness! The court will permit you the chance to make one final statement. If you lie under oath again, Mr. Godot's coffee mug awaits you... As does my gavel!\nArmstrong:\nO-Oui... It is clear.\nPhoenix:\n(What do they always say in the movies...? \"I've got a bad feeling about this...\"?)\nJudge:\nVery well! Begin your final testimony, Mr. Armstrong!\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Confession --\nArmstrong:\nIt is true, I 'id la body in la kitchen.\nA man forced me to do it. I 'ad no choice.\nI 'ad to go along w'iz 'im because... Z'ere was a reason why I could not refuse.\nBut I did not kill 'im! I swear it! You must believe me!\nJudge:\nYou were \"forced\"? By who!?\nArmstrong:\nI-I cannot say! Or I will be... erased!\nPhoenix:\nLet's try a different question then. When Mr. Elg died, was he really the only person at his table?\nArmstrong:\n... Z'ere was... Z'ere was another man.\nPhoenix:\n(I knew it!)\nMaya:\nMaggey was telling the truth!\nJudge:\nYou may cross-examine the witness now, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(There's just one more thing I need to do. I gotta break this guy, and get him to tell us the name of the real killer.)\nCross Examination\n-- The Confession --\nArmstrong:\nIt is true, I 'id la body in la kitchen.\nArmstrong:\nA man forced me to do it. I 'ad no choice.\nArmstrong:\nI 'ad to go along w'iz 'im because... Z'ere was a reason why I could not refuse.\nArmstrong:\nBut I did not kill 'im! I swear it! You must believe me!\nMaya:\nHe's already confessed this much! He might as well stop dancing around the real issue!\nPhoenix:\nYeah. But he really doesn't want to tell us who the killer is.\nMaya:\nThen sock it to him, Nick!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, that's not a bad idea!)\nPhoenix:\nA half million dollar loan from a black-market loan shark. And you had no way of paying it back, did you? That's why you were forced to do anything this man told you.\nArmstrong:\n... Oui, it is as you say.\nMaya:\nMr. Armstrong...\nArmstrong:\nLa Tiger... 'E told me 'e was going to use my restaurant for a business rendez-vous. On la day in question, 'e was meeting la victim to demand z'at 'e repay 'is loan. I don't know why it 'appened like zat! I just did what 'e told me to do. I 'ad no choice! I carried la body and la inconscient Maggey out of la dining area... ...and into z'e kitchen. After z'at, I just tried to forget what I 'ad seen!\nPhoenix:\nI think we can now safely say that the man who forced your hand was Mr. Furio Tigre.\nJudge:\nHmm... I do have one further question for you, Mr. Armstrong. The poison and the lottery ticket were recovered from the defendant's apron pocket. Was that your doing as well?\nArmstrong:\nNon! I knew nothing about z'at! Making it look like it was Maggey who 'ad done it... I was... I was not... It is déspicable!\nJudge:\nMr. Godot!\nGodot:\n...\nJudge:\nYou will summon this Furio Tigre as a witness! I doubt that can be arranged today, so we will adjourn for now. Proceedings will continue tomorrow...\nGodot:\n...Thirty minutes.\nJudge:\nWh-What!?\nGodot:\nThe trial will go on. I'll see to it myself. I need half an hour to get that guy on the stand. Not a minute more.\nPhoenix:\nH-How the...?\nGodot:\nDon't sit back and relax yet, Trite! No one knows if that chef is really telling the truth or not. This trial could still go either way.\nJudge:\nVery well. Your request is granted, Mr. Godot. We will resume once Mr. Tigre is ready to take the stand. Until then... Court is adjourned for a 30 minute recess!\nTo be continued.\nJanuary 8, 1:21 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1\nMaya:\nSo we're finally going to see The Tiger on the stand! We've almost got this case won now, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nI wish I could agree.\nMaya:\nHuh?\nPhoenix:\nWhen I cross-examined Mr. Armstrong just now... ...he said he was just doing what The Tiger told him to do. But Godot picked up on it, remember? He pointed out that without proof, we don't know if what he testified is the truth.\nMaya:\nYou mean, you think Mr. Armstrong was lying?\nPhoenix:\nI don't know. But if that's the line the prosecution takes, we could be in trouble. (I get the feeling that we don't have the case-making evidence we're going to need.)\nHey, pal!\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe!\nMaya:\nWhat are you so jumpy about, Detective!? Your hair's standing on end!\nGumshoe:\nHey, that's the pot calling the kettle black, little Ms. Topknot!\nMaya:\nIt's not a topknot!\nPhoenix:\nNever mind about the hair! Just calm down, alright?\nGumshoe:\nI-I-I can't stand still when I don't have a job to do! I-I-I kinda get wound up. Aaaaaaargh!\nPhoenix:\n(No kidding!)\nGumshoe:\nYou gotta have something you need me to do, pal! Anything!\nPhoenix:\nWell, um...\nGumshoe:\nHey, I'm gonna take a jog back down to the precinct. I could get some prints analyzed for you if you've got an hour!\nPhoenix:\nAn hour!? The trial will have reconvened by then!\nMaya:\nBut, Nick! We still don't have a really decisive piece of evidence, right?\nPhoenix:\n(True. Without some kind of trump card to pull out of the bag, we're really stuck...) You said you could get some fingerprint analysis done in an hour?\nGumshoe:\nYou bet!\nPhoenix:\nIn that case, would you mind checking the prints on this for me?\nSmall Bottle given to Detective Gumshoe.\nGumshoe:\nOK, I'll get this off to the lab right away. Just make sure you don't lose the case before I get back!\nPhoenix:\n(This is pretty much the final showdown, I guess...)\nMaya:\nIt's time to separate the phonies from the real guys!\nJanuary 8, 1:56 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4\nJudge:\nCourt will now reconvene. Mr. Godot. Did you find this Furio Tigre...?\nGodot:\nI even tamed him for you. It was a 3 cup job. No problem.\nPhoenix:\n(T-Tamed him...? The guy's name may be Furio Tigre, but come on...)\nGodot:\nHe's pretty lively. Be careful... He still bites.\nJudge:\nVery well. Please show Mr. Tigre to the stand!\nJudge:\n...Um... Witness. Please state your name and occupation for th--\nTigre:\nGrrraaaaaaaargh!\nMaya:\nAaaaaaaah!\nPhoenix:\n(Don't hide under the table Maya! ...Unless there is room for me down there too!)\nJudge:\nI, uh... Um... W-W-W-Would you mind...\nTigre:\nWhat'youse say to me!?\nJudge:\nN-N-N-Nothing! I didn't say nuddin'! Honest!\nPhoenix:\n(Who could've guessed that fear would induce a bad Brooklyn accent in the judge?)\nTigre:\nI got business to take care of, ya hear me? So who the hell called me into dis hole? Was it you', spikey!?\nPhoenix:\nAck, no. Of course not... It was... the judge... ... Your Honor!?\nJudge:\nOh, dear! I, um... I seem to have dropped my pen. Where on earth is it...? Don't mind me! Just carry on with the proceedings as normal.\nPhoenix:\n(That's it. We're doomed.)\nTigre:\nMaybe youse didn't hear me! I said, who the hell was it dat called me in here!?\nGodot:\nThere's no need to shout. We can all hear you.\nTigre:\nWhad'youse say?\nGodot:\nThere's no point struggling. You're caught in a snare. The relentless snare of the law! And I'm the one that hauled you in!\nTigre:\nGrrr...\nPhoenix:\n(T... Too cool...)\nMaya:\nDon't let him get the better of you, Nick!\nGodot:\nLet's start with the basics. You know about the incident in question, correct?\nTigre:\nIncident!? I don't know nuthin' about no stinkin' incident, mask boy!\nGodot:\nYou mean you didn't attend the previous trial of Maggey Byrde?\nTigre:\nMaggey who!? I've got more important things to do dan watch courtroom dramas!\nJudge:\nOf course. Well, perhaps you could give us your testimony, then? Please tell us about what you did on the day of the murder.\nTigre:\n...Hmph. Phoenix Wright!\nPhoenix:\n...!\nTigre:\nYouse de one who set dis up, didn't you'? Youse gonna regret the day you ruffled The Tiger's fur. You' hear what I'm sayin'?\nPhoenix:\n*gulp* (Maybe I should've brought a diaper with me today...)\nMaya:\nGet a grip, Nick!\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Tiger's Alibi --\nTigre:\nI don't know nothin' about no murder.\nI was tied up with business in December last year. Spent all'a my time in my office.\nI got whales lined up to borrow cash from Tender Lender every single day.\nYouse wanna check my alibi, just ask Violetta.\nJudge:\nAh, at last I found my pen. Very well then, Mr. Wright. Your cross-examination, plea--\nTigre:\nAaaaargh!\nJudge:\nWh-What is it!? Please, witness, if you could refrain from shouting out like that.\nTigre:\nI know de kinda games dat guy in the blue plays! That lowlife ain't no lawyer! He just punches away at stupid details 'til he wins.\nPhoenix:\nL-Lowlife...? Me?\nTigre:\nListen up, smarty! Every time you' ask me some'ding dat doesn't relate to dis case... ...I'm gonna bill you 50,000 dollars! And youse gonna borrow the cash from me!\nPhoenix:\nUh... (That's one loan contract I refuse to sign!)\nTigre:\nAnd don't think it ain't gonna hurt when you' get tangled with The Tiger!\nGodot:\nHa...! I love a good spectator sport.\nJudge:\nJ-J-Just a minute! That's really not...\nGodot:\nThis witness is... How can I put it? A hungry tiger roaming the urban jungle! Get on his bad side, and he'll bite everyone's heads off. Yours, too!\nJudge:\nVery well. I have no choice but to impose a penalty system here.\nTigre:\nYouse better be listening. I said I got business to take care of. Big business! If I don't split now, I ain't gonna catch my bus...\nJudge:\nThe court will impose a penalty for any irrelevant pressing of witness testimony. Keep that in mind as you begin your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor.\nMaya:\nYou can do it, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nCome out from under there already, would you, Maya?\nCross Examination\n-- The Tiger's Alibi --\nTigre:\nI don't know nothin' about no murder.\nTigre:\nI was tied up with business in December last year. Spent all'a my time in my office.\nTigre:\nThe day youse talkin' about, I was in de office, too. I never saw that kid before.\nTigre:\nI got whales lined up to borrow cash from Tender Lender every single day.\nTigre:\nYouse wanna check my alibi, just ask Violetta.\nMaya:\nJust think! All you have to do is press him on something irrelevant, and bam! $50,000!\nPhoenix:\nGet real, Maya! How about you pay back the money then. Your allowance should cover it!\nMaya:\nHey! I'm no idiot, you know!\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I'M certainly not the one who thought the $50,000 was free money!) Anyway, I need to work this guy without pressing his testimony too hard.\nMaya:\nBut his testimony is pretty solid as it is...\nPhoenix:\n(I admit nothing jumps out at me as a contradiction. But I've got to find an opening somewhere... Or I need to make one.)\nPhoenix:\nMr. Tigre... You claim you didn't know Mr. Glen Elg. But it appears that Mr. Elg knew you.\nTigre:\nWhat!?\nPhoenix:\nMr. Elg left this little note on his calendar. \"Meet with The Tiger\"... And the date? December 3rd. (Changed from ['Meet with The Tiger'... Dated, December 3rd.] in the original release)\nJudge:\nD-December 3rd!? That's... the day of the murder!\nPhoenix:\nSo, Mr. Tigre, I submit that you did indeed know one Mr. Glen Elg! Because on the very day of the incident, you met with him!\nTigre:\n... Grrrah ha ha ha hah! Not bad! Youse actually not bad.\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry?\nTigre:\nI was just messin' with youse to see how good you' were.\nMaya:\nDid you hear that, Nick? He said you're not bad!\nPhoenix:\n(That's one compliment I can do without! Plus, he's lying through his teeth!)\nJudge:\nUm, witness. Please remember that you're under oath. Lies will not be tolerated.\nTigre:\nYouse callin' me a liar!? Is that what you' doin'!?\nJudge:\nRuh-roh!\nGodot:\nSo you're saying that your claim to have \"never seen that kid before\" is the truth?\nTigre:\nI said I'm dead serious! Youse betta believe that's the truth!\nGodot:\nHa...! Then I'd say that gives me time... to enjoy another cup of pure black magic! That is, while you testify for the court again, Mr. Tigre.\nJudge:\nOh, yes! Um, would you mind indulging the court, witness?\nPhoenix:\n(He never actually met the victim!? That's got to be a lie right there! It's time I nailed this guy!)\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Victim, Glen Elg --\nTigre:\nI ain't no liar. I never met Glen Elg.\nThere was some lame guy with that name, though. Wanted to borrow cash from me.\nI set up a meetin' with the guy... at my office, Tender Lender.\nI waited around for him, but he ain't ever showed.\nI ain't never been to that Trés Bien joint, youse hear?\nJudge:\nI see... That all seems perfectly logical. You had arranged to meet with the victim, but he didn't show up.\nGodot:\nI've heard it's pretty hard to keep appointments when you're dead.\nJudge:\nVery well. You may begin your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor!\nTigre:\nDidn't I tell you I got a big deal goin' down today? I ain't gonna make my bus now. I'm gonna have to take the express train. That bill's goin' straight to you... Wright!\nPhoenix:\nGrr...\nCross Examination\n-- The Victim, Glen Elg --\nTigre:\nI ain't no liar. I never met Glen Elg.\nTigre:\nThere was some lame guy with that name, though. Wanted to borrow cash from me.\nTigre:\nI set up a meetin' with the guy... at my office, Tender Lender.\nTigre:\nI waited around for him, but he ain't ever showed.\nTigre:\nI ain't never been to that Trés Bien joint, youse hear?\nMaya:\nDo you think he really didn't meet Glen Elg?\nPhoenix:\nNot likely. Because I'm convinced this guy's behind the whole thing.\nMaya:\nSo you mean... that whole testimony he just gave was a lie?\nPhoenix:\nOf course. So we can't afford to give him time to think of ways to plug the leaks in it. I've got to nail him while I still can!\nPhoenix:\nMr. Tigre. Is there something you'd like to tell the court about these matches?\nTigre:\nMatches? What youse talkin' about?\nPhoenix:\nWe found them in your office at Tender Lender. They're from \"that\" restaurant.\nTigre:\nWh...!?\nPhoenix:\nIf you've really never been to Trés Bien before... ...what was a book of the restaurant's matches doing on your desk!?\nTigre:\nYouse been snoopin' around in my stuff now too, wiseguy!? What are you', my ball and chain!? Ain't no broad controlling me!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Well, witness? I think it's time you started telling us the truth, don't you?\nTigre:\nGrrraaaaargh!\nJudge:\nS-Sorry! I'm terribly sorry! Forgive me!\nTigre:\nI ain't no pussy-cat! I don't go back on what I said! But, OK... I was at the joint that day.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!? (Changed from [Whaaat!?] in the original release)\nTigre:\nBut listen good, alright? I might've been there, but I still never met that kid.\nGodot:\nWell, well... Looks like an order just came in for another testimony.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm this close to proving it was him! He did meet Glen Elg that day. And he did put poison in his coffee! He must have!)\nWitness Testimony\n-- At Trés Bien --\nTigre:\nI was supposed to meet wid the kid at the restaurant that afternoon.\nWhen I opened the door to the joint, I saw one ugly scene.\nThe guy was laid out over the table, stiff as concrete.\nI figured if the place wasn't hot already, it was gonna be, so I split.\nI heard the cop's sirens on my way out, and I went straight back to my office.\nJudge:\nI see... You didn't actually meet with him in the end, then. Well, Mr. Wright. Your cross-examination, please.\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.\nTigre:\nHold it! If I wait around here any longer, I ain't even gonna make the normal express. No more stupid questions.\nGodot:\nHa...! No problem. Any time Trite presses you on something irrelevant, I'll see he pays a penalty.\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Godot! That's my job!\nGodot:\nYour job is to slam that little hammer of yours and call a guilty verdict. So do it!\nJudge:\nY-Yes, sir!\nTigre:\nThe special express ain't cheap, Wright! Just so youse know since youse payin'!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, man. Doesn't the rule of law mean anything around here!?)\nCross Examination\n-- At Trés Bien --\nTigre:\nI was supposed to meet wid the kid at the restaurant that afternoon.\nTigre:\nWhen I opened the door to the joint, I saw one ugly scene.\nTigre:\nThe guy was laid out over the table, stiff as concrete.\nTigre:\nI figured if the place wasn't hot already, it was gonna be, so I split.\nTigre:\nI heard the cop's sirens on my way out, and I went straight back to my office.\nMaya:\nWell, Nick? What do you think?\nPhoenix:\nHe's running out of ways to avoid the truth. I need to press him fast before he has time to think things through. I've got to come right back at him with a contradiction!\nMaya:\nBe careful what you press him on, though, or you'll get penalized, OK?\nPhoenix:\nYou're something of a loan collecting pro, aren't you, Mr. Tigre?\nTigre:\nNo one escapes The Tiger's clutches!\nPhoenix:\nWell I'm something of a lie detecting pro.\nTigre:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAnd no one escapes The Phoenix's clutches! I think it's time we got something straight.\nGodot:\nWhat's this, Trite? A new line of irrelevant questioning?\nPhoenix:\nThese are the floor plans of the crime scene. You say you were standing at the entrance, Mr. Tigre? From there, your field of vision would have covered an area something like... this.\nJudge:\nIndeed. The witness would have had a clear view of the victim's seat.\nTigre:\nIsn't that what I just said? I saw the back of the kid's head.\nPhoenix:\nUnfortunately for you, that is not possible. If the court would think back, you'll remember that between each of the tables... ...is a tall partition!\nJudge:\nWhy...! That's true!\nPhoenix:\nNow look at the plans again! The truth is painfully obvious! From the entrance, the field of vision of any customer walking in... ...ends here!\nTigre:\n...\nPhoenix:\nSo, from the entrance of Trés Bien, you couldn't have seen the victim's seat. But you did see the victim that day... because you met with him!\nGodot:\nGodot:\nWrong! Have you forgotten the old man's testimony yesterday? The victim was alone at his table.\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nBut the defense just proved that point to be moot! The \"victim\" witnessed by Mr. Kudo was not Glen Elg, but a fake!\nGodot:\nWhat!?\nPhoenix:\nIn order to have Mr. Kudo falsely testify... ...the real killer posed as the victim he had just killed and acted out a charade!\nJudge:\nThat will do! This trial has gone on long enough without the obvious question being answered. Who exactly was this \"real killer\" who impersonated the victim?\nPhoenix:\n...!\nJudge:\nYou say the killer murdered Glen Elg... ...and then impersonated his victim in a performance for Victor Kudo? In that case, Mr. Wright, reveal the identity of this \"criminal\" to the court!\nPhoenix:\nObviously... ...the killer is Furio Tigre! No one else could have done it.\nJudge:\nWh-What!? Well, witness?\nTigre:\n... Grrrah ha hah! Now that's cute! Youse think you can pin this on The Tiger!? Maybe youse don't understand. The Tiger is king of the jungle! So I dares you' to say it again! Come on! You' got the guts!?\nJudge:\nY-Y-You can't threaten m-me, Mr. Tigre! I-It's the defense! Go ahead and tell the witness, Mr. Wright! Mr. Wriiight!\nTigre:\nSounds to me like it must be you', old man. Youse got guts, I'll give you that.\nJudge:\nM-M-Mr. Wright! Do not leave me to handle this alone!\nGodot:\n...Ha...! Perhaps I can end this embarrassment.\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Godot!\nGodot:\nLet's just go back over Mr. Kudo's testimony one more time. The old man didn't see just the victim! Oh, no, no, no.\nKudo:\nThe serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it! There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there!\nGodot:\nWas the victim he saw the real victim or not? That doesn't matter. The fact remains, he saw the accused put the poison into the coffee!\nJudge:\n...! Yes, it was the waitress who poisoned the coffee--\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nV-Very impressive, Mr. Godot. ...Waiting for my absence to launch your attack!\nGodot:\nHa...! Found your pen at last, Trite?\nPhoenix:\nIt was in my pocket. *ahem* But anyway... Mr. Kudo witnessed two people that day. He saw the victim, the \"supposed\" Mr. Glen Elg, and the \"waitress\"... from behind.\nJudge:\nYes... Your point, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nI think the conclusion is obvious. If this \"Glen Elg\" was really the killer in disguise... ...then surely it's possible the \"waitress\" was also part of the show.\nJudge:\nWhat!? You mean, the waitress was an imposter as well!?\nPhoenix:\nThe defendant, Ms. Byrde, fell unconscious immediately after the incident. And someone used her fainting to hatch an elaborate plan to pin the murder on her!\nJudge:\nWho on earth was it!? Who was this \"waitress\" that Mr. Kudo witnessed?\nJudge:\nW-Who is this woman?\nPhoenix:\nHer name is Viola Cadaverini. She's an employee of Tender Lender.\nTigre:\nYouse makin' a big mistake... D'you know who Violetta's grandfather is? You' betta be goin' home in an armored truck tonight, if you' know what I mean...\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nStop shaking, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nWh-Where was I? Yes, the defendant, Ms. Byrde, has stated the following...\nByrde:\nWell, when I took the coffee over to the victim's table... ...it's true there was another customer in the restaurant.\nByrde:\nUmm... She was sort of creepy... And she had a kind of cackling laugh.\nTigre:\n...\nPhoenix:\nThere are just too many contradictions in this case. The \"second man\" at the victim's table who nobody but Ms. Byrde seems to have seen. The earpiece worn by the victim in his left ear when that eardrum was ruptured! And the radio show he was supposedly listening to half an hour after it was over. There is only one logical explanation that clears up all of these contradictions! The whole incident took place twice! Once for real, and once for show! And, Mr. Furio Tigre, the only person who could have committed the crime... ...was you!\nTigre:\n... ......\nJudge:\nW-Witness? What have you got to say?\nTigre:\n... That's cute!\nJudge:\nS-Sorry?\nTigre:\nYouse alright. I could do with a guy like you' around.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What do you mean?\nTigre:\nOK, I'm in on this game! I'm gonna have to charter a jet to get me to my meetin' now, but... ...I'm gonna give youse one more thing to think about before I go.\nPhoenix:\nSomething to think about?\nTigre:\nYouse got it all wrapped up nice, huh, Wright? But youse missed out one real important thing!\nPhoenix:\nBut that can't be!\nTigre:\nI was in the joint that day. And I met that kid, too.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nTigre:\nBut I couldn't have poisoned him, youse hear?\nJudge:\nWhat!? Do you really expect us to believe you now, Mr. Tigre?\nGodot:\nHa...! What a troublemaker.\nPhoenix:\nT-Troublemaker...?\nGodot:\nLooks like we're going to need another one for the road. One more steaming cup of hot testimony!\nJudge:\nIndeed. Witness, you will explain yourself to the court. I will give you one more chance to testify. What happened that day at Trés Bien between yourself and the victim?\nWitness Testimony\n-- Ties to the Victim --\nTigre:\nYeah, I loaned Elg cash. About 100,000 dollars.\nThat day, we was due to have a little chat. The kid had hit his payback date, see?\nSo anyway, he tells me he's got no way to pay up.\nI'm about to flatten the guy, when he starts screamin'.\n\"Yesss! I won! Half a million bucks!\" He got lucky, you' know. Real lucky.\nIf that waitress hadn't done what she done, everythin' woulda been over.\nJudge:\nNow, I see that the principal amount you loaned to Mr. Elg was 50,000 dollars...\nTigre:\nYeah, well. Youse got the vig to take into account. Interest builds up fast, you' know.\nPhoenix:\n(That's faster than fast! 100,000 dollars is twice his principal!)\nJudge:\nAnd the repayment deadline was December 3rd, the day of the incident in question.\nTigre:\nYeah. He was one lucky kid! He got that half a million just in time. So I ain't have no reason to kill the kid. And if I ain't got no motive, you ain't got no case!\nPhoenix:\n(His motive? Hmm... He has to have one, but what is it?)\nCross Examination\n-- Ties to the Victim --\nTigre:\nYeah, I loaned Elg cash. About 100,000 dollars.\nTigre:\nThat day, we was due to have a little chat. The kid had hit his payback date, see?\nTigre:\nSo anyway, he tells me he's got no way to pay up.\nTigre:\nI'm about to flatten the guy, when he starts screamin'.\nTigre:\n\"Yesss! I won! Half a million bucks!\" He got lucky, you' know. Real lucky.\nTigre:\nIf that waitress hadn't done what she done, everythin' woulda been over.\nTigre:\nThanks to what she did, my business with that kid was over!\nTigre:\nI was after the $100,000. I didn't have no other reason to kill the guy!\nMaya:\nSo The Tiger was meeting Glen Elg to get his money back. If Mr. Elg had just given him the lottery ticket, that would have been the end of it.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, so what's The Tiger's motive? (This is the big one. If I don't manage to undermine this testimony, it's all over for us.) Why would he have to poison Mr. Elg? And why did he loan him the money in the first place, when he knew he couldn't repay him?\nPhoenix:\nOn the day of the murder, Mr. Tigre's sole intention was to get his hands on this CD! Glen Elg had no way of paying back the 100,000 dollars, and Mr. Tigre knew it. But then a miracle happened. The kind that Mr. Tigre would prefer to say never happened. But he can't. And neither can I. (Changed from [The kind that Mr. Tigre would prefer to say never happened. But he can't. Neither can I.] in the original release)\nGodot:\nThe lottery win?\nPhoenix:\nExactly! At the eleventh hour, Mr. Elg won half a million dollars on the lottery! Which left Mr. Tigre with no way of getting his hands on the all-important CD. At least, no legitimate way. So he resorted to illegitimate means.\nGodot:\nThat's crazy!\nPhoenix:\nHe murdered Glen Elg, and then made his next move... To frame Maggey Byrde for the crime! Mr. Tigre posed as Glen Elg... ...while Viola Cadaverini played the role of Ms. Byrde. And then they re-enacted the whole thing, in order to establish a witness. The witness being the one we all heard testify yesterday, Mr. Victor Kudo.\nGodot:\nGodot:\nLike I said, Trite, that's crazy. No one could pull off a stunt like that. For starters, there's no way the chef could've been kept out of it.\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nBut Mr. Armstrong was in on it from the very beginning. (Changed from [But Mr. Armstrong knew all about it.] in the original release) Have you forgotten already, Mr. Godot? Mr. Armstrong owed the witness money, too. Half a million dollars, in fact. He had no choice but to go along with Mr. Tigre's plan!\nTigre:\n...\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Silence, or I will clear the courtroom!\nTigre:\nGrrraah ha ha ha ha hah! Youse put on a good show, Spikey!\nPhoenix:\n...!\nTigre:\nIf youse wanna stay alive in the loan shark business, you' gotta be careful. Youse sayin' I dressed up like that kid, created a witness, and framed someone? If I did something crazy like that, I'd leave a trail as bright as my shirt! I ain't dumb enough to do something sloppy like that!\nPhoenix:\nI agree.\nTigre:\nY-You' do!? (Changed from [Whaaat!?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nDespite your appearance, you are very careful. That's why you took one more precaution. One more trick to make sure Ms. Byrde had no way out!\nJudge:\nWhat!? Another one, Mr. Wright!?\nGodot:\nInteresting. Why don't you fill us all in, Trite? What was this trick you say Mr. Tigre performed to frame the accused?\nJudge:\nWhat on earth is that? What an insult to think anyone could be fooled by such a childish imitation!\nPhoenix:\n(Consider yourself insulted, Your Honor!) Mr. Tigre. You didn't just pose as the victim on the day in question. A month ago, in this very court, you posed as me!\nTigre:\n...\nJudge:\nWhaaat!? That's... That's...\nPhoenix:\n...The truth.\nJudge:\nBut! The witness looks nothing like you, Mr. Wright! ... ...... ... Although... Now that I think about it, it was you, wasn't it?\nTigre:\n...!\nJudge:\nNo doubt it was you... Standing in here, this very court, a mere month ago. The Phoenix Wright who put up the most disreputable, shabby defense I had ever seen!\nTigre:\nGrrr... Grrraaaaaaaaargh!\nGodot:\nGodot:\nCan you prove that, gramps? Prove the \"attorney\" who represented the accused here a month ago was this man? Are you prepared to take the stand and testify that it was him!?\nJudge:\n...*gulp* H-Hmm...\nTigre:\nH-Hey... F-Forget about it, yeah?\nPhoenix:\n...!\nTigre:\nI wouldn't do somethin' like that. Not me. You... You made a mistake, right? It was someone else, huh?\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHave you no pride, sir!?\nGodot:\nGodot:\nThis isn't a matter of pride. In case you didn't know, Trite, here in court, we deal with people's lives!\nPhoenix:\nNrrrgh...\nJudge:\n... Mr. Godot is right.\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor!?\nJudge:\nSpeaking for myself, I am absolutely convinced. The attorney in question was the witness standing before me now! However... I preside over this court as the judge! With the vested power to hand down a verdict. Someone in my position cannot be swayed by a memory without evidence to support it.\nPhoenix:\nNooooooo!\nJudge:\nIf the defense has no further evidence, the court will now excuse the witness. The circumstances surrounding Mr. Tigre are dubious for sure, but not conclusive!\nMaya:\nBut we've come so far!\nGodot:\nYou say he impersonated Glen Elg. You say he impersonated you. But none of that adds up to a murder charge. You don't have a shred of evidence that the witness poisoned the victim's coffee!\nPhoenix:\nNnaaaaaaaaaaaargh!\nTigre:\n... Ha!\nPhoenix:\n...!\nTigre:\nSucks to be you, Wright. Don't mess with The Tiger, or you're gonna get mauled, youse got that!?\nPhoenix:\n(All we managed to do here was chase him around a bit. But I was so close to getting him to admit his own guilt!)\nGodot:\nHa...! Looks like I won't be needing a refill.\nPhoenix:\n(If I just had one more piece of evidence... One more piece of evidence and maybe I could get Maggey off the hook!)\nJudge:\nThis witness's cross-examination is over. You are free to go, Mr. Tigre!\n???:\n...Your Honor, sir...\nGumshoe:\nWaaaaaaaait!\nJudge:\nD-Detective!\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe!\nGumshoe:\nSorry I took so long, pal! I... I... I staked everything on this. My badge... The works! So here it is! My heart's counting on this, too!\nJudge:\nWh-What is it, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nIsn't it obvious, pal? It's the final, decisive piece of evidence!\nJudge:\nWh... Whaaat!?\nJanuary 8, 2:48 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1\nGumshoe:\nSorry it took so long, pal. But I finally got the results from the lab.\nPhoenix:\nThe results?\nGumshoe:\nAbout the prints, pal! From this medicine bottle!\nMaya:\nOh! So? Do you know who the prints belong to now?\nGumshoe:\nDo you think I'm some kind of hack detective? Of course I know!\nMaya:\nSo? Tell us! They're The Tiger's right? I knew it!\nGumshoe:\nHeh heh heh! You bet! Clear as crystal, all over the bottle! They're Furio Tigre's paw prints alright!\nMaya:\nThat's great! We've got him now, Nick!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nWhat's wrong with you!? You've hardly said a word since Detective Gumshoe got here. He's laid everything on the line for this, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nI know. Look, I'm sorry. This is kind of hard to say, but... It really doesn't make any difference whose prints are on that bottle now.\nGumshoe:\nHuh!? What!? Why not?\nPhoenix:\nWhat we need to produce at this stage in the trial... ...is irrefutable evidence that The Tiger put poison in Glen Elg's coffee. He's already admitted that he met the victim. The fact that his prints are on this bottle... That's really doesn't make any difference now.\nGumshoe:\n...! ... I knew it. Great... No matter how hard I try... I'm never of any use.\nMaya:\nHey, don't be so hard on yourself...\nGumshoe:\nThis was our last chance to help Maggey. And I've been working on some useless piece of evidence the whole time! It's alright. I'm a real loser. It's not breaking news to me, pal.\n???:\nUm...\nByrde:\nDetective... Gumshoe...?\nMaya:\nM-Maggey!\nByrde:\nYou've been working on something... for me?\nGumshoe:\n... Sorry I let you down, Maggey. I know you didn't do it. And I'm a detective! We're supposed to be able to prove stuff like that! I'm really sorry! I'll get out of your hair now.\nByrde:\nDetective Gumshoe! Wait!\nPhoenix:\n(He's gone...)\nMaya:\nIsn't there anything we can do now, Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(I wish there was! Gumshoe worked so hard to get that evidence. If only there was some way I could use it...)\nSmall Bottle put into pocket.\nJanuary 8, 3:04 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4\nJudge:\nMr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nI granted you a recess so you could prepare this \"decisive evidence\" you've discovered.\nPhoenix:\nUm... Yes...\nGodot:\nDon't keep us all in suspense, Trite! Show us. Naturally... ...we can assume it's evidence that will actually stand up in court... can't we?\nPhoenix:\n(Think, Phoenix! Don't let Gumshoe's hard work go to waste!)\nTigre:\nHow much more of my time are youse gonna waste!? I ain't been to no court before... ...but youse lawyers sure know how to blow things outta proportion!\nJudge:\nNo doubt, given the nature of the evidence, it will speak for itself. Nevertheless, you will talk us through it, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Well I know I can't prove anything new with this evidence. I'm really backed into a corner here. But maybe if he thinks he's got me beat... ...he'll let his guard down a bit!)\nJudge:\nDon't keep us waiting any longer, Mr. Wright. Present this final, decisive piece of evidence to the court!\nPhoenix:\nThis is the defense's final piece of evidence.\nJudge:\nIsn't that the victim's...?\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor. Naturally, the court is already aware of the contents of this bottle. However, interesting new information has come to light. We have clearly identified some fingerprints on it. Fingerprints belonging to you, Mr. Tigre!\nTigre:\nWhat!?\nGodot:\n...\nJudge:\nBut, Mr. Wright... What conclusion are you hoping to draw from this new information?\nPhoenix:\n(Everyone in here knows what this bottle contains. Except one man. One person in this courtroom should theoretically be in the dark.)\nTigre:\nMy prints are on that pansy-lookin' bottle? Is dat what youse sayin'? Well, what the hell's in it anyway!?\nPhoenix:\n(A phony trial, a phony lawyer, and phony clues. Everything about this case has been phony. Seems like the perfect excuse for some phony evidence!) Mr. Tigre! This is the decisive piece of evidence that will prove your guilt! Why? Because it contains...\nPhoenix:\nThis bottle contains... potassium cyanide. (Changed from [This is the bottle containing the potassium cyanide.] in the original release)\nJudge:\nP-Potassium cyanide...?\nPhoenix:\nThe poison used to murder Mr. Elg, Your Honor. The victim's killer used this very bottle!\nTigre:\n... ......\nPhoenix:\nAnd on this bottle, Mr. Tigre, we found your fingerprints. Well!? How do you explain that!?\nTigre:\n... Ha ha ha ha ha! You'd make a good clown, you' know that!\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nTigre:\nYouse ain't never gonna get this to stick. Youse just makin' me laugh now. You' think a cheap bluff like that's gonna fool The Tiger?\nPhoenix:\nA bluff?\nTigre:\nI can see straight through you, Phoenix Wright! That ain't the bottle with the cyanide in it.\nPhoenix:\nNo, no. This is the bottle we found traces of the poison in.\nTigre:\nDon't mess with The Tiger or you're gonna get ripped to shreds! The cyanide bottle was brown. And it was made of glass. That cheap piece of trash don't look nothin' like it!\n............ (Changed from [...] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Got him! At last...)\nTigre:\nWh-What? Why's everyone gone quiet? I said that bottle...\nPhoenix:\nIs this the bottle you're referring to?\nTigre:\nYeah! That's it! That's the bottle the cyanide was in. But youse ain't gonna find my prints on that bottle! Don't let that cozy-lookin' suit fool you people! That lawyer's just playin' games! Tell him, Mr. Prosecutor! Tell that guy where to go! (Changed from [Tell him, Godot! Tell that guy where to go!] in the original release)\nGodot:\nYou still haven't figured it out...? Don't you realize what you just said?\nTigre:\nWhat I said? What did I just say?\nPhoenix:\nYou were summoned to this court for the first time earlier today. If you really had nothing to do with the murder... ...you shouldn't have known all the little details. For instance, you shouldn't have known what kind of bottle the potassium cyanide was in.\nTigre:\nErr... grrr...\nPhoenix:\nBut just now, you slipped up in front of every single person in this courtroom. You described the exact bottle used by the killer to hold the poison!\nTigre:\nErr... ummm... Youse don't know who youse messin' with! I'm The Tiger! I control millions of dollars on the black market! Youse think I'm gonna let some jumped-up suit get the better of me!?\nPhoenix:\nSure, the last piece of evidence was phony. But that's just what you deserve! The phony trial with a phony lawyer... It was all played out by you, the biggest phony of all!\nTigre:\nGrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr... ... Gwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\nJudge:\nWh-What's going on!?\nBailiff:\nIt looks like a blackout.\nGodot:\nWell done... Trite. I saved my 17th cup of coffee just for you. Savor it... While you watch the police restrain your prey. (Changed from [While you watch your caged prey.] in the original release)\nJudge:\nWright, you caught a tiger by his toe, but if this one hollers, he won't be let go. Now then, how are things going with Mr. Tigre, Mr. Godot? (Changed from [The prosecution will be sure to take care of Mr. Tigre, won't you, Mr. Godot?] in the original release)\nGodot:\nHe is being arrested on suspicion of the murder of Glen Elg, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nFortunately for us... ...we managed to rectify a very grave error. Ms. Byrde was found guilty in the absence of a genuine defense attorney.\nPhoenix:\nYes, she was.\nGodot:\nAnd in the absence of genuine evidence. But The Tiger made one mistake.\nJudge:\nIndeed. He very nearly got away with everything if it wasn't for that one slip of the tongue. Furio Tigre is a truly frightening criminal.\nGodot:\nHa...! The truly frightening one... ...is that defense attorney over there.\nPhoenix:\n(Godot...)\nJudge:\nWell. I am now in a position to deliver my verdict. This court finds the defendant, Maggey Byrde...\nNot Guilty\nJudge:\nThat is all. This court is adjourned!\nJanuary 8, 4:10 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1\nByrde:\nMr. Wright! I-I-I... I'm at a loss for words! Thank you, sir!\nMaya:\nCongratulations, Maggey!\nByrde:\nI was so mad when Mr. Wright landed me in all that trouble a month ago. But now I feel like I can forgive him!\nPhoenix:\nHey! That wasn't me, Maggey! That was The Tiger.\nMaya:\nLook, Nick! In the doorway!\nPhoenix:\n(Detective Gumshoe!)\nGumshoe:\nOh. Guess I'll be heading off then. See you 'round, pal.\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait!\nGumshoe:\n... ...\nByrde:\nDetective Gumshoe...\nGumshoe:\nOh, oh yeah. Congratulations, Maggey!\nByrde:\nThanks...\nGumshoe:\n...\nByrde:\n...\nGumshoe:\nI-I knew you were innocent all along.\nByrde:\n... Why didn't you say that in your testimony then?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? Oh... Well... I was... ... Well, guess I'll be heading off then. See you 'round.\nPhoenix:\nWait up, Detective! (He just ran off!)\nMaya:\nMaggey! Why are you being so hard on him? He busted his butt for you! It's thanks to him that we got the medication bottle...\nByrde:\nThat wasn't even of any use!\nMaya:\nBut...\nByrde:\nIt's only because Mr. Wright used it so cleverly. Detective Gumshoe was just running around in circles.\nPhoenix:\n(Poor guy...)\nMaya:\nLooks like she still isn't ready to forgive him. Can't you put in a good word for him, Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, Maya is right. I should help Gumshoe out. It's clear he needs it.) Uh, Maggey... You know, Detective Gumshoe's been really worried about you through all of this.\nByrde:\nI wanted to believe that, sir. But on that first day of the trial... ...he practically gave the judge a free pass to lock me up!\nPhoenix:\nHe didn't have any choice, Maggey. He's a detective. He has to report the facts.\nByrde:\nHe doubted me, that's why! He thought I might have done it!\nPhoenix:\n(I've got to prove her that Gumshoe really cares about her. I know. I'll give her a little present to celebrate her freedom...)\nSo the case of phony versus genuine comes to an end. The false allegations surrounding Maggey have all been cleared up. And who knows? Maybe a whole new chapter of her life is about to start...?\nEpisode 3: Recipe forTurnaboutTHE END"

You can clean the toilet later! This is important!\nPhoenix:\n*sigh* What are you freaking out about now?\nMaya:\nHey hee. Today will be the last time you talk to me that way!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMaya:\nWe're about to hit the big time!\nPhoenix:\n\"Big time\"? And what do you mean by \"we\"? You don't mean you and me are...?\nMaya:\nHa! Don't be silly. I'm talking about me and Pearly, of course!\nPearl:\nHello. It's a pleasure to see you again, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nPearls! You haven't changed a bit! Wait... What are you doing here anyway?\nPearl:\nHee hee. Haven't you heard, Mr. Nick? Here! Take a look at this!\nPhoenix:\n(What's this...? Some kind of poster?) Kurain Village... Isn't that...?\nMaya:\nThat's right. It's our hometown... Pearly and mine, that is.\nPhoenix:\nWhat's this about \"treasures\" from the boonies?\nMaya:\nHa ha ha. Very funny. You can laugh all you want... But you'll be singing another tune tonight!\nPhoenix:\nTonight? What about tonight?\nPearl:\nThe \"Treasures of Kurain\" exhibit doesn't actually start until next week, but... ...the promoter sent us some special VIP entry passes!\nMaya:\nThat's why I dressed up extra special today! What do you think, Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Heh. Same Maya. Different day.) This young lady here is Maya Fey... The younger sister of Mia Fey... ...My friend and mentor. I first met her two years ago... I was working on the case surrounding Mia's death, and ever since then...\nMaya:\nI've been the one who's been keeping this law office afloat from behind the scenes.\nPhoenix:\nActually that's just a cover for her true identity... In reality, she's a spirit medium, and a bit of a shady character.\nMaya:\nHey! Who are you calling \"shady\"!?\nPhoenix:\nAnd this little girl is Pearl Fey, but I usually call her \"Pearls\". She's Maya's cousin and a spirit medium in training herself.\nPearl:\nI know I'm a bit young, but I want to help in any way I can, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nKurain Village is the home of the mysterious Kurain Channelling Technique. And Maya here is the daughter of the Kurain School of Channeling's Master. ...I know it sounds ridiculous, but it's no joke. I've seen her power with my own eyes... It's the real thing alright.\nMaya:\nEarth to Nick! How long are you going to make two gorgeous women like us wait!?\nPearl:\nYes, Mr. Nick! I can't wait any longer! I want to see the exhibit!\nPhoenix:\n(*sigh* Looks like I don't get a choice here.

The city's fanciest and most expensive department store. Treasure Exhibit, huh... I have to admit I'm pretty impressed.)\nMaya: \nWow... This is awesome!\nPhoenix: \nYeah... You can make even the cheapest junk look great... It all depends on how you display it.\nPearl: \nOh! They even have the dusty old hanging scroll that was in the Fey Manor storeroom!\nMaya:  \nOh yeah, I remember scribbling on it when I was a little girl!\nPhoenix:\n(On a family heirloom...!?)\nMaya:  \nSay, Nick... The person in charge of this exhibition is waiting for us in the basement warehouse.\nPhoenix:  \nAlright...

I feel like a monster could jump out at any time...\nMaya:\nDon't be scared, Pearly! I'll protect you!\n???:\n...Oh... ...Mr. Wright.\nMaya:\nEeeeeeeek!! A monster! You were right!\nPhoenix: \n(Huh? A monster...?)\n???: \nGood evening. ...It's good to see you again.\nPhoenix: \nY-You... I know you...\n???: \nHa ha. Nice to see you again too, little miss.\nPearl: \nAh! H-Hello!\nMaya: \nIs she a friend of yours, Nick? ...And how do you know her, Pearly?\nAndrews: \nNice to meet you. I'm Adrian Andrews. I'm in charge of the promotion and planning for this Treasure Exhibit. I'm also responsible for the security arrangements.\nMaya: \nOh, um... N-Nice to meet you.\nPhoenix: \n(Adrian sure has changed since we last met...)\nAndrews: \nSo this is the warehouse.

Have you all eaten yet?\nPhoenix: \nUm, well actually...\nAndrews: \nI've already made a reservation at the restaurant on the 12th floor. Why don't we all dine together?\nMaya: \nOoh! I like the sound of that! \"Dine\"... It sounds so fancy!\nPearl: \nI'll have the \"Kid's Lunch\"!\nMaya: \nHa ha ha. Pearly, it's dinner, not lunch. Why don't you go for it and really eat your fill with a \"Kid's Dinner\"?\nPearl: \nOK! In that case, one \"Kid's Dinner\" for me!\nAndrews: \nHa ha. Shall we head upstairs, then?\nPhoenix: \nAfter that pleasant evening, all that remained was to wait for the exhibition's opening. It was wonderful seeing Ms. Andrews looking so happy. None of us could have imagined... ...that the very next day, something terrible would happen...\nOctober 12, 10:09 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nMaya: \nN-Nick! This is terrible! ...What the--!? You're cleaning the toilet again!? I never knew you were such a toilet freak!\nPhoenix:  \nGimme a break, would you? My brain just hit the snooze button for the fifth time...\nPearl: \nUm... I'm going to turn on the TV!\nAnnouncer:  \n...We've got an update on the recent treasure heist! Based on clues found at the scene of the crime, authorities have announced... that they believe it was the work of the renowned phantom thief, Mask☆DeMasque!\nPhoenix:  \n...M-Masque the Mask...?\nAnnouncer:  \nAccording to a spokesperson, Lordly Tailor received a threat letter some days ago. This is the fifth heist by the phantom thief, who only targets rare treasures.\nPhoenix:  \nL-Lordly Tailor...!?\nMaya:  \nWell, Nick!? What are you going to do!? Don't you dare go back to scrubbing the toilet!\nPhoenix:  \nTreasure...? Lordly Tailor...? You don't think...!?\nMaya:  \nYes! Now, get up, Nick! It was stolen! By Mask☆DeMasque!

Let's see if we can find some clues that might lead us to the bad guy!\nPhoenix: \n...But it doesn't look like anything has been disturbed.\nMaya: \nYeah, it looks pretty much the same as it did last night.\nPearl: \nHmmm... Bad guy, huh.\n???: \nHey! You can't poke around here, pal!\nPhoenix: \nWait a minute... that voice. Oh no! Not him again!\n???: \nIt's YOU!! And I'm the one who should be saying \"not again\"! Why is it that every time something bad happens, you always show up, pal?\nPhoenix: \nI should be asking you that. Aren't there any other detectives?\n???: \nNo, I should be asking YOU that. What are you doing hanging around here?\nPhoenix: \nHey, I asked you first. Why are you here any--\nMaya: \nAlright, alright, we got it! Why don't you two kiss and make up already?\nPearl: \n...Um, hello. It's been a long time, Mr. Scruffy Detective!\n???: \nOh! It's you, little missy! ...Um, ahh...\nGumshoe:\nActually, my name is Gumshoe. \"Detective Dick Gumshoe\"! Now is a good chance for you to try to remember it right!\nMaya: \nAnd if it's too long for you, you can just call him \"Dick\".\nPearl: \nOkay! It's good to see you again, Mr. Detective Dick!\nGumshoe: \nUm... Yeah...

To protect the art pieces, you know.\n???: \n...Welcome! To my private little \"Banquet of Chaos\".\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? What the heck does THAT mean...?)\n???: \nI'm afraid I have very little to offer, but please... make yourself at home.\nMaya: \nErr, umm... Who are you anyway...?\n???: \nSHHH! SILENCE! ...

A lawyer, and... a spirit medium. Neither very advanced at their trade! ...Am I wrong?\nMaya: \nYikes! Th-That's scary! H-How did you know that!?\n???: \n\"How\" you say? The universal skeptic would say that how is nothing but a question of why. I am traveler of both time and space, and a swimmer of dreams.\nMaya: \nWhat is he talking about? I can't make heads or tails of it...\n???: \nWithout further ado, let me fulfill what should be the first duty of any gentleman...\nAtmey:\n...and introduce myself. The name is Atmey... Luke Atmey! ...Ace Detective.\nPhoenix: \nOh... Umm... Hi.\nMaya: \nDon't let him intimidate you, Nick! Stand up and show him what you're made of!\nPhoenix: \nErr, umm... The name's Wright.

Why does the phrase \"one short of a baker's dozen\" come to mind with this guy?)\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting DeMasque's Calling Card:\nAtmey:\n... ...Well, Sir Lawyer. I've been told that you too are pursuing the mysterious thief.\nPhoenix:\n...Well, I'm not sure would say that exact--\nMaya:\nThat's right! We're going to find the Sacred Urn no matter what we have to do!\nAtmey:\n...Excellent. I will trust you. I permit you to take a look around while I investigate elsewhere.

You captured Mask☆DeMasque!?\nGumshoe:\nBingoooo! Well... Actually, he surrendered... ...But I still got him!\nPhoenix:\n(Mask☆DeMasque surrendered?)\nPearl:\nThat's great! So when can we come and pick up the Sacred Urn?\nGumshoe:\nUm, ahh, well ya see... I was gonna tell you...\nPhoenix:\nWhat...? Something wrong?\nGumshoe:\nDo you think you can swing by the detention center sometime?\nPhoenix:\nThe detention center...? (Changed from [Detention center...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nHe wants to talk to you... Mask☆DeMasque, that is.\nMaya:\nWhaaaat!? He wants to talk to Nick?\nGumshoe:\nI'll be waiting for you, pal. So get over here soon.\nPhone:\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\n(The detention center, huh?)\nOctober 12Atmey Detective Agency\nPhoenix:\nThis is a detective agency? Looks like more like the set of some B-grade horror movie.\nMaya:\nH-Hello? Is anyone here...?\n...\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like nobody's home.\nMaya:\nHmph. What a waste of time. Hey! I know! Let's take that framed picture back with us as a memento!\nPhoenix:\nDon't you dare, Maya! (Guess we'll have to try back later...)\nOctober 12\nDetention CenterVisitor's Room\nGumshoe:\nHey, pal!

So where's the Sacred Urn?\nGumshoe:\nOh, Sorry about that, pal... I guess I didn't really think about it before... But you're the \"victim\" in this case.\nMaya:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nWell, I guess I should let you guys hear the story straight from the horse's mouth.\nMaya:\nYou know, he's right, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nHe is?\nMaya:\nIf you think about it reeeeal hard, we are the victims!\nPhoenix:\nWell... I guess so... In a way...\n???:\nUmm...\nMaya:\nI'm so used to thinking of the victim as a dead person 'cause we're always on murder cases.\n???:\nEx-Excuse me...\nMaya:\nBut anyway! I have to get the Sacred Urn back!\n???:\nPleeeeease! Don't just ignore meeeeee! ...Err.\nMaya:\n...Um, who are you?\n???:\n...I, err, umm. I-I-I... I-I'm Ma-Ma-Ma...

Your husband told us that you wanted us to stop by.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nI'm Maya Fey, and this is Phoenix Wright, attorney at law.\nDesirée:\n\"Nicky boy\" and Maya, huh? I can't tell you how grateful I am that you decided to help my Ronnie.\nMaya:\nWell, um... Aha ha... You're welcome.\nPhoenix:\n(Did she really call me \"Nicky boy\"?)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nDesirée:\nSay... Can I ask you something, Nicky boy?\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it?\nDesirée:\nI know I may seem like a \"bad girl\" on the outside... But the one thing I won't stand for is illegal activity.\nMaya:\nI had the feeling you wouldn't! You're tough... But I can tell you've got a good heart. (Changed from [I had the feeling you didn't! You're tough... But I can tell you've got a good heart.] in the original release)\nDesirée:\nSomebody framed my poor Ronnie, I just know it. Umm... Could you give this to Ronnie for me?\nMaya:\nA letter?\nDesirée:\nYes, for Ronnie. I want him to fight back.\nMaya:\nMs. DeLite... OK, you've got it!

Mr. Lawyer?\nPhoenix:\nYes?\nRon:\nIn the letter that Dessie wrote, she said... \"Ask this guy to be your lawyer!\"\nMaya:\nHuh...?\nRon:\nErr, umm... I know this would be asking a lot, but... Could you please take my case? My trial starts tomorrow...\nMaya:\nHey, hang on a second! He can't be your lawyer!\nPhoenix:\nWhy not?\nMaya:\nWhat do you mean, \"why not\"!? We're the victims in this case, right!? Victims of this DeMasque guy!\nPhoenix:\nWell, yeah... But according to Desirée, he didn't do it...\nPearl:\nShe said, \"Poor man, he's deluded himself into thinking he did it.\" Right, Mr. Nick?\nMaya:\nCome on! She could be lying to protect her husband!\nPhoenix:\nW-Well, that's true. ...Err, no actually not. Actually it's hard to say (...Oh no, it's spreading!)\nRon:\nOh, please! I'll give you the treasure of your choice in return...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... What should I do?)\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick...! I-I was wrong about you...

From the bottom of my heart, I apologize for what I said!\nPhoenix:\nAww, it's OK! I'm the one that should be apologizing!\nPearl:\nWell, I'm going out now for a little bit.\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? Wh-Where are you going...?\nPearl:\nI may be small, but I still have a lot of spirit channeling power! So I'm going to show you I can be useful too... By finding some evidence!\nPhoenix:\nHey!

A lawyer, and... a spirit medium. ...Am I correct?\nMaya:\n...Umm. I think we've already been through this.\nAtmey:\nHa! So my estimation was correct! Zvarri! ...How truly elegant. Now then, what can I do for you?\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\nWell it looks like we got one thing cleared up anyway.\nMaya:\nHuh? What? That Atmey is the greatest Ace Detective in the world?\nPhoenix:\nNo, that he never actually saw the thief.\nMaya:\nOh... that's right! So the thief may not even be Mask☆DeMasque...\nAtmey:\nJust one moment, Sir Lawyer! The thief was unquestionably Mask☆DeMasque!\nMaya:\nBut you never actually saw him!\nAtmey:\nPerhaps so, but I installed a security camera for just such a contingency.\nMaya:\nOh...\nAtmey:\nLast night, the camera went off exactly once. Behold! This is a photo of the dastardly thief, taken by the security camera!\nPhoenix:\n...Th-That's him!\nMaya:\nM-Mask☆DeMasque...!\nSecurity Camera Photo added to the Court Record.\nAtmey:\nThe thief can be none other than the arch-criminal, Mask☆DeMasque.

Nick! Remember what Detective Atmey said!?\nAtmey:\nExactly that. Mr. DeLite had a very good reason to dress up and commit those crimes.

Ever since grade school, he's been... Not exactly a close friend, but yeah, we know each other.\nButz:\nHey, man, that wasn't nice! I was your very first client!\nPhoenix:\nWe've got quite the... storied history, he and I.

Doesn't look like something's changed since we were here last?\nPhoenix:\n(Now that you mention it...)\nMaya:\nThis bag... I'm sure it wasn't here before.\nPearl:\nIt looks quite full... I wonder what could be in here?\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Come on! Open it up!\nPhoenix:\nHey! Wait a minute! We can't just open his private property!\nMaya:\nDon't be such a fuddy-duddy! This is an important investigation!\nPhoenix:\n(That's true... And truth be told, I have to admit I am kind of curious...)\nMaya:\nWell? What's in there?\nPhoenix:\nH-Hang on a sec. I'm taking it out now... (Whatever it is, it feels... kinda hard... and smooth...)\nAtmey:\n...Well, hello there!!\nMaya:\nEEEEEEK! H-He's here!\nAtmey:\n...What are you doing, Sir Lawyer? I'm shocked to see a servant of the court ignoring the law so flagrantly!\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm really sorry! M-Maya made me do it!\nMaya:\nNick! I can't believe you!\nAtmey:\nA gentlemen never uses a lady as an excuse for his own poor behavior... The real question is... Can you afford to waste time lollygagging about here?\nPhoenix:\nWh-What do you mean by that?\nAtmey:\nPerhaps I should make myself more clear? Tomorrow's trial... Zvarri! Shall we say the figurative Sir William will be dropping his panties before lunchtime?\nMaya:\nWow, Nick! Sounds like it's gonna be really exciting.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\n(It looks like we're done investigating for the day.)\nAtmey:\nHee hee hee hee hee... Sir Lawyer... The stage has been set and all the pieces are finally in place. All that remains now... is for the dance to begin!\nPhoenix:\n(A new prosecutor, an Ace Detective and a thief... This will be one tough trial.)\nTo be continued.\n\nOctober 13, 9:36 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 4\nMaya:\nHey, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it? Is something wrong...?\nMaya:\nNah. But did you see all the people here? It's crazy! Oh! So, check out the Mask☆DeMasque glossy I bought! (Changed from [Oh! Look at this! I bought this Mask☆DeMasque publicity photo!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nYou bought this... where? (Changed from [You bought that...? Where!?] in the original release)\nPearl:\nFrom the little tents in front of the courthouse. They have all sorts of things for sale!\nMaya:\nYou know I'm sucker for this kind of stuff!\nMask☆DeMasque Publicity Photo stuck into the Court Record.\nCome on! I'm guilty! Throw the book at meeee!\nPearl:\n...Who's screaming like that?\nRon:\n...Oh! Mr. Wright! You made it!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I did. But it doesn't look like things are going to get any less ugly for you...\nRon:\nBecause I did it!! I'm the criminal! Me! Me! Meeeeeee!\nMaya:\nUngh... He's at it again.\nRon:\nI sent the calling card to Lordly Tailor! I admit iiiit!!\nPhoenix:\nBut... You don't have the Sacred Urn, right?\nRon:\nWell, that's true, but... That doesn't mean that I didn't commit the crime.\nPhoenix:\n(Normally, when I say \"Of course you didn't\" I'm being sarcastic, but you... Yikes!)\nRon:\nAnyway, I admit that I'm guilty... So make sure they give me a guilty verdict! Pleeeeease!?\nDesirée:\nOh, there you are Ronnie! Bonjour, sweetie!\nRon:\nOh! D-Dessie honey! B-Bonjour! ...Well, actually... I don't really know why I should be speaking French to you at a time like this\nDesirée:\nLeave it all to me, Ronnie! I swear I'll protect you!\nRon:\nUmmm, errr... Aaah... Well, ahh... You see... Actually the thief is err, me\nDesirée:\nCan I tell you something, Nicky boy? I can guarantee that my Ronnie is innocent! If he's declared guilty, I'll be ever so cross with you!\nPhoenix:\n(So why are you smiling when you say it?)\nDesirée:\nWell, if you'll excuse me! I've got some errands I need to take care of! I'm counting on you, Nicky boy! Good luck!\nPhoenix:\n(To be honest, I really don't know whether Ron is Mask☆DeMasque or not. But there's only one thing I AM sure of. He doesn't have the Sacred Urn right now...)\nBailiff:\nMr. DeLite! It's time for you to enter the courtroom!\nPhoenix:\n(For the time being, I guess I'll have to trust Desirée...)\nOctober 13, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 6\nJudge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Ron DeLite.\nPhoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your honor.\n???:\n...\nJudge:\nWhat about the prosecution? Are you prepared to...\n???:\n...What a stupid question!\nJudge:\nWh-What did you say!\n???:\nFine. Let me ask you then, Your Honor. Are YOU ready? Are you ready to pass judgement?\nJudge:\nWh...! N-No, I... I'm not! I will pass judgement after I hear arguments from both sides.\n???:\nWell, if you're not ready yourself, you shouldn't expect others to be. That's a rule to live by.\nJudge:\n...Um, wh-who are you?\nGodot:\nI am Godot. Legendary prosecutor. I've never lost a case.\nMaya:\nAh! He's the one that Detective Atmey was talking about...\nJudge:\nYes, your reputation precedes you. What kind of cases have you dealt with so far?\nGodot:\nHa...! None.\nJudge:\nWhat did you say...?\nGodot:\nI've never prosecuted a case before.\nJudge:\nN-Never? But you said you've never lost before.\nGodot:\n...Exactly. I've never lost. I've never won before either.\nJudge:\nQuite arrogant for a beginner, aren't you?\nGodot:\nEven the mightiest of redwoods begin their lives as mere saplings.\nJudge:\nYes, but... A mask? In a court of law?\nGodot:\nHa...! Don't you know anything? No matter the man, we all wear masks... Either on our faces or ever our hearts.\nJudge:\n...!\nMaya:\nThis guy is the real deal alright, Nick...\nPhoenix:\n(Why does it seem like all prosecutors are the \"real deal\"...?)\nGodot:\nSo we finally meet... Mr. Phoenix Trite!\nPhoenix:\n...?\nMaya:\nN-Nick! Is he a friend of yours?\nPhoenix:\nNo. I don't have any friends that call me \"Trite\". (Just who is this masked man...?)\nGodot:\nI've returned from the depths of Hell... To do battle with you.\nJudge:\nWell then, err, Prosecutor Gobo.\nGodot:\nIt's not \"Gobo\". It's Godot... Your Honor.\nJudge:\nIn any case, please give your opening statement.\nGodot:\nOpening statement? Those things are not fit for even dogs to consume. I have only one thing to say before we start. To you... Mr. Trite.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What is it?\nGodot:\nAre you familiar with the saying, \"A chain is only as strong as its weakest link\"? I wonder... how much you can withstand before you and your case break in two...?\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\nHmm... Well then, let's hear from the first witness!\nGumshoe:\nUm, my name is...\nGodot:\nNo one asked for your name, witness.\nGumshoe:\n...Urk.\nGodot:\nThe important thing is what you know... That's all. Start talking. ...We're listening.\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir.\nJudge:\nAlright, witness. First, let's hear about... What you know about the thief that stole the urn.\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir!\nWitness Testimony\n-- Mask☆DeMasque's Crimes --\nGumshoe:\nMask☆DeMasque is a master thief that first started his crime spree 6 months ago.\nHe's so confident that he sends his calling card before he even commits the crime!\nThis was his fifth heist, and as usual, he sent a card on to Lordly Tailor.\nHis pattern is to always go after only the most precious art pieces.\nThat's why we're sure it was Mask☆DeMasque, sir. It fits his M. O. to a T!\nJudge:\nHmm... So then the actual identity of this Mask☆DeMasque is... M-Mr. Godot! W-What are you--!? (Changed from [M-Mr. Godot! Y-You!] in the original release) W-We're in the middle of a trial here, Mr. Godot!\nGodot:\nBlacker than a moonless night, hotter and more bitter than Hell itself... That is coffee. I'm sure you can grant me at least this much... Your Honor. Oh, please. Proceed.\nJudge:\n... Very well. It's only coffee, after all.\nPhoenix:\n(What!? You can't be letting him slide this early in the trial!)\nJudge:\nProceed with your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.\nMaya:\nWell, Nick? What are you going to do?\nPhoenix:\nAs long as they haven't brought up Mr. DeLite's identity... ...all we can do is show that it wasn't Mask☆DeMasque who stole the urn.\nCross Examination\n-- Mask☆DeMasque's Crimes --\nGumshoe:\nMask☆DeMasque is a master thief that first started his crime spree 6 months ago.\nGumshoe:\nHe's so confident that he sends his calling card before he even commits the crime!\nGumshoe:\nThis was his fifth heist, and as usual, he sent a card on to Lordly Tailor.\nGumshoe:\nHis pattern is to always go after only the most precious art pieces.\nGumshoe:\nThat's why we're sure it was Mask☆DeMasque, sir. It fits his M. O. to a T!\nMaya:\nNick! It definitely looks like it was Mask☆DeMasque who stole the urn!\nPhoenix:\nBut there's no real evidence either way as to whether Ron DeLite is Mask☆DeMasque.\nMaya:\nBut... But...\nPhoenix:\nAlso, the urn hasn't turned up yet, let alone in connection to Mr. DeLite himself.\nMaya:\nSo even though we know it was Mask☆DeMasque that did it...\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe for the time being, I should try to show it wasn't Mask☆DeMasque that did it!)\nPhoenix:\n...Can I ask you a little something, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\n...Just hearing the \"little\" in that question is making me nervous.\nPhoenix:\nYou said that he always \"goes after the most precious art pieces\", right?\nGumshoe:\nThat's right, pal.\nPhoenix:\nBut there's one problem... That's not what he did in this case. The supposedly \"priceless\" urn doesn't exactly rise to the level of \"precious art\"!\nGumshoe:\nWh-What do you mean!?\nMaya:\nN-Nick! How can you say such a terrible thing!?\nPhoenix:\nNo! I meant from a financial point of view! I mean, it wouldn't fetch a good price.\nJudge:\nWell, Prosecutor Godot? What is the value of that urn?\nGodot:\nThe appraisers I spoke to said they couldn't attach a price to it. And I mean that in the worst sense.\nPhoenix:\nSo in other words... It was not the kind of item that Mask☆DeMasque would normally go after!\nGumshoe:\nUrk!\nJudge:\nHmm... If I understand you correctly, Mr. Wright... ...you're saying that the theft of the Sacred Urn was not the work of Mask☆DeMasque...!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes... That's what I'm saying. (Actually all I did was point out the contradiction. The argument made itself, but...)\nJudge:\nWell... First of all, we need to get this issue cleared up. Was this last robbery the work of Mask☆DeMasque or not? What do you have to say about this, Mr. Godot?\nGodot:\nThis coffee here... It's my own special blend. I call it Godot #107. I'm trying to decide whether to cut down on the acidity or the bitterness... That's the only thing I've got on my mind right now... ...Mr. Trite!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!?\nGodot:\nIf you're really a man, you should clean up your own mess.\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Sorry, but I didn't get what you mean.\nGodot:\nIf you're saying it wasn't Mask☆DeMasque that stole the urn... ...then it must be someone imitating Mask☆DeMasque's methods... A fake.\nJudge:\nA-A Fake☆DeMasque?\nMaya:\nFake☆DeMasque? That sounds so ridiculous. ...But I like it.\nGodot:\nNow, before I decide on my coffee, I believe some proof is in order, Mr. Trite. Proof that the person who appeared at Lordly Tailor that night was actually a fake.\nJudge:\nHmm... Though I don't approve of Mr. Godot's behavior, his point is valid. Mr. Wright. ...We're waiting.\nPhoenix:\n(It looks like I'm going to have to prove it... I need proof that the person at Lordly Tailor that night was in fact, Fake☆DeMasque!)\nPhoenix:\nThe proof is right here.\nJudge:\nThis looks like... a photo taken by a security camera.\nPhoenix:\nBut if you look closely... you'll notice something peculiar about it.\nGodot:\nHa...! Well then, why don't you go ahead and show us what it is. Go on. Use this pointer and show us just what about this picture is so \"peculiar\".\nPhoenix:\nIt's right here, of course!\nJudge:\nYou mean... Mask☆DeMasque?\nPhoenix:\nI have here a piece of reference I would like the court to take a look at.\nMaya:\nIsn't that the publicity photo I bought this morning...?\nPhoenix:\nThe problem I have with the security camera photo is the broach on DeMasque's chest.\nJudge:\nA Breach? Here!? Bailiff! Get my steed! We need to retreat at once!\nPhoenix:\n...A broach, Your Honor. It's a sort of clasp for holding one's cape on.\nJudge:\nA clasp, eh... Ah! I see now!\nGumshoe:\nBut the Mask☆DeMasque in the security camera photo... Ahh!! He has no broach!!\nPhoenix:\nThat broach is the same as the emblem on DeMasque's calling card and serves as his symbol. But the thief that broke into Lordly Tailor wasn't wearing a broach... In other words, this \"Mask☆DeMasque\" is a fake!\nGumshoe:\n...! I-I've been fooled agaaaaaain!\nJudge:\nO-Order! It's true... Undeniably true... Detective Gumshoe! How... How could you have overlooked this!?\nGumshoe:\nI-I'm sorry, sir! I don't know how I...\nGodot:\nHey now... ...If you're gonna have a pity party, invite me, too!\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Godot! You deserve some blame in this, too! How could you have overlooked such a large broach...?\nGodot:\nHa...! The broach you're talking about... Do you mean this?\nGumshoe:\nAh...!\nPhoenix:\nTh-That's...! Mask☆DeMasque's broach!\nJudge:\nWh-Where did you find it!?\nGodot:\nWell I've always had a good nose for evidence... I got it at the crime scene. It was hidden in the shadow of a big female Buddha statue.\nPhoenix:\n(\"Buddha statue\"...? He must mean the Ami Fey statue.)\nGumshoe:\nWh-Why didn't you tell me about that, sir!?\nGodot:\n...I always put evidence away in my pocket. ...After all, it's the safest place for crucial evidence.\nMaya:\nGrrr... This guy is one cool customer.\nGodot:\nIt's a little early to be shaken up, isn't it, little lady? ...That friend of yours left pretty little hickeys on there, too.\nJudge:\nH-Hickeys?\nGodot:\nFiguratively speaking, of course... I'm referring to Ron DeLite's fingerprints.\nGumshoe:\nWhaaa...?\nJudge:\nWhat!? The defendant's fingerprints are on the broach!? Order! Order in the court! Mr. Godot! Let's see that broach!\nGodot:\nI've grown attached to my metallic girlfriend here. ...Take good care of her.\nJudge:\nHmm... She-- I mean, it appears to have been torn off some clothing. There's a little bit of cloth left on the back.\nGodot:\nObviously there must have been a big struggle that night at the crime scene.\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh... Phoenix, we have a problem...)\nDeMasque's Broach added to the Court Record.\nGodot:\nHa...! You mess with Godot... ...and you get burned.\nPhoenix:\n(Grr... He's been playing me like a violin...)\nGodot:\nWell Judge, I'm about ready to call my next witness.\nGumshoe:\nHuh? You're done with me? But I haven't proved anything yet.\nGodot:\nYou've proven your own incompetence. That's good enough.\nGumshoe:\n...That doesn't sound good at all.\nJudge:\nBailiff! Bring the next witness into the courtroom!\nPhoenix:\n(Finally time for the Ace Detective to make his appearance, huh...?)\nGodot:\nOne second is one drip of the coffee pot. Let's hurry it up.\nAtmey:\nSHHH! SILENCE!... Hee hee hee hee hee... Now I see. It's all becoming clear.\nJudge:\nWh-What's clear?\nAtmey:\n...Zvarri! The truth has once again been elegantly revealed to me! What we have here is... A judge and a prosecutor. ...A coffee maniac, at that! ...Am I correct?\nJudge:\nW-Well, yes. That's right.\nGodot:\nHa...! Not bad. Not bad at all. You're the first person that's ever been able to penetrate my secret veil.\nAtmey:\nWell, Sir Prosecutor. Let me introduce myself. My name is Luke Atmey, Ace Detective and rising star illuminating the heavens.\nMaya:\nBoy, these two make a perfect pair...\nPhoenix:\nThey'd either be best friends or they'd tear each other's heads off.\nJudge:\nI've heard that on the night of the crime, you were all alone on security detail.\nAtmey:\n...You have heard correctly. My specially-made monocle is worth more than a hundred Detective Gumshoes. ...If Detective Gumshoe was worth anything, that is.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\n(Why was this guy all by himself anyway...? There must be some reason. I'm sure of it!)\nJudge:\nWell then, tell us what this special monocle of yours witnessed!\nWitness Testimony\n-- What I Witnessed --\nAtmey:\nIt was approximately 1 o'clock in the morning... just after the date changed.\nThat's when my nemesis, the infamous Mask☆DeMasque, dancingly descended upon me!\nJust as I began to turn, the coward struck a fierce blow upon my noble head!\nDarkness swallowed me before I could land a single strike. When I awoke, he was gone.\nThirty minutes later, I used an emergency phone to notify the police!\nJudge:\nSo you didn't get a clear look at the criminal?\nAtmey:\nMy specially-made monocle never misses a thing. However! That is limited to things that fall within my own visual range! But of course, that's only natural.\nJudge:\n...I fall to see why the witness seems so proud of his performance that evening.\nAtmey:\nWell, Sir Old-Timer, let me explain. We are not speaking of any ordinary thief... ...but of the kings of thieves! The great Mask☆DeMasque, my arch-enemy! That is what my instincts and my years of experience tell me!\nJudge:\nHmm... Very well. Proceed with the cross-examination, Mr. Wright.\nCross Examination\n-- What I Witnessed --\nAtmey:\nIt was approximately 1 o'clock in the morning... just after the date changed.\nAtmey:\nThat's when my nemesis, the infamous Mask☆DeMasque, dancingly descended upon me!\nAtmey:\nJust as I began to turn, the coward struck a fierce blow upon my noble head!\nAtmey:\nDarkness swallowed me before I could land a single strike. When I awoke, he was gone.\nAtmey:\nThirty minutes later, I used an emergency phone to notify the police!\nMaya:\nThere's something suspicious about Detective Atmey... How could he not have noticed when the thief came in?\nPhoenix:\nAlso, he says he was knocked unconscious before he could fight back... But that can't be right. It contradicts the evidence.\nMaya:\nHuh? Which piece...?\nPhoenix:\n(The real question is... Why would he tell such an obvious lie?)\nPhoenix:\n...Mr. Atmey. Could you take a look at this with that special monocle of yours?\nAtmey:\nAha! This belongs to the criminal mastermind, my arch-nemesis, Mask☆DeMasque! It is, in point of fact, Mask☆DeMasque's broach!\nPhoenix:\nIt was found on the floor of the basement warehouse. I wonder how that happened?\nAtmey:\nHa... Elementary, my dear lawyer. Obviously it wasn't glued on well enough.\nPhoenix:\nNot quite. It clearly shows signs of having been ripped off a piece of clothing.\nJudge:\nRipped off...? Aha!\nPhoenix:\n...We can only deduce that the thief struggled with someone that night! That's the only thing I can think of. And there's only one person that was in a position to have a struggle with the thief. The only person that was on security duty that night...You, Detective Atmey!\nAtmey:\n...Urk!\nPhoenix:\nDetective Atmey! You must have fought with the thief that night! (Changed from [Detective Atmey! You must have fought with the thief last night!] in the original release) So, why did you lie in your testimony to the court?\nJudge:\nWitness! Giving false testimony is a serious crime!\nAtmey:\nErr, I... N-No! W-Wait just a moment, Sir Old-Timer!\nJudge:\nDon't talk to me like I'm living in a nursing home!\nAtmey:\nHee hee hee he he he... I just remembered, Your Honor. I was just confused because I've been dealing with so many cases lately.\nGodot:\nThe true measure of a man is in the amount of work he does. That's what I always say.\nMaya:\nNick, you can only handle one case at a time... Isn't that right?\nPhoenix:\nYou talk too much.\nJudge:\nWitness! So are you now saying that you and the thief fought?\nGodot:\nHold on. That's quite enough... Your Honor.\nJudge:\nE-Excuse me...?\nGodot:\nSave the big questions for the testimony. That's one of my rules.\nAtmey:\nIndeed! I understand! I, Luke Atmey, agree completely!\nWitness Testimony\n-- Fight With The Thief --\nAtmey:\nIndeed, it's true that I looked away from the door for a brief moment.\nHowever... Luke Atmey cannot be so easily discombobulated!\nUnfortunately, the thief grabbed a weapon from the side and... rendered me senseless.\nA true gentleman fights only with his own fists... But they were not enough.\nHis first blow struck true! Bam! ...And that's all she wrote.\nJudge:\nSo in the end, you did catch a glimpse of Mask☆DeMasque?\nAtmey:\nCorrect. It was during his third crime that he struck me from behind. It seems that my memory has become a tad jumbled, so to speak.\nJudge:\nHmmm... Well, that's certainly understandable. I, myself, always get confused about which testimony goes with which case.\nPhoenix:\n(Th-That can't be good...)\nCross Examination\n-- Fight With The Thief --\nAtmey:\nIndeed, it's true that I looked away from the door for a brief moment.\nAtmey:\nHowever... Luke Atmey cannot be so easily discombobulated!\nAtmey:\nUnfortunately, the thief grabbed a weapon from the side and... rendered me senseless.\nAtmey:\nA true gentleman fights only with his own fists... But they were not enough.\nAtmey:\nHis first blow struck true! Bam! ...And that's all she wrote.\nAtmey:\nI put my back to the wall to fight, but the thief's blow landed upon my third eye.\nMaya:\nWell what do you think, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nWell, there's one thing that I'm absolutely sure of now.\nMaya:\nYeah? What is it!?\nPhoenix:\nThe Luke Atmey guy... He's definitely hiding something!\nMaya:\nB-But why?\nPhoenix:\nI think I'm starting to figure out what really happened that night. (...And about the true nature of this \"detective\".)\nPhoenix:\nDetective Atmey! Your testimony is crumbling like a house of cards.\nAtmey:\nWhat fun this is, Sir Lawyer! It is truly a pleasure to cross swords with you! And now, once again, you have thrown down the gauntlet at my armored feet...\nPhoenix:\nI believe this is what you said yesterday.\nAtmey:\nNo, the coward must have wormed his way in through somewhere besides the door... Then my arch-nemesis struck me on the head from behind with this gruesome item here!\nJudge:\nFrom behind, huh?\nPhoenix:\nBut just now you testified that he struck you on the forehead... I hardly think you could forget where you were hit on the head!\nAtmey:\n...Urk! It seems... I-I've made another mistake.\nPhoenix:\n...Detective Atmey. That's not the only strange part of your testimony.\nJudge:\nWh-What do you mean by that?\nPhoenix:\nFor example... The very fact that you hid the calling card from the police itself is strange! It's almost as if... You were afraid they were going to help with security!\nAtmey:\nU-Urk...! Geniuses such as myself have always been misunderstood! How sad...\nPhoenix:\nThat's wrong!\nGodot:\nGodot:\n...To err is human, to forgive divine. Humans aren't machines... They have souls, feelings. They live, they die, they love, they hate... And yes, they even make mistakes...\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHey, hold on! It-It's not as pretty as that!\nGodot:\nReally? What is it like then!?\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nAlways chase a riddle down to the end. That's one of my rules.\nPhoenix:\n(This is it... This might just be my chance to turn things around!)\nJudge:\n...Mr. Wright. What exactly is it that you're asserting?\nPhoenix:\nVery well, Your Honor. The defense asserts that...\nPhoenix:\nThe answer is simple! It's all clear to me now! Detective Luke Atmey's true identity is actually... Mask☆DeMasque!\nAtmey:\nYeeeeaaargggh!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Mr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!?\nPhoenix:\nThere are too many unnatural parts to Mr. Atmey's story. He says he was \"hiding\" at the crime scenes, which is why no one ever saw him there. And then, in his last case, he manages to outperform Detective Gumshoe and... ...the entire police force to \"miraculously\" retrieve the stolen treasure.\nAtmey:\nTh-That's because... I analyzed the crime scene data and made an exquisitely elegant deduction. I picked up clues that the police overlooked in order to arrive at a...\nPhoenix:\nOh, please! The explanation is far simpler than that, \"Detective Atmey\"! The truth is that you are, in fact, Mask☆DeMasque.\nAtmey:\nGurk...!\nJudge:\nB-But Mr. Wright! Th-This photo! It clearly shows Mask☆DeMasque! This security camera belongs to Lordly Tailor Department Store! He shouldn't have been able to manipulate it...\nPhoenix:\nHe didn't need to manipulate it! He gained access to the warehouse under the pretense of providing \"security\"... Then he simply dressed as the \"thief\" and stole the urn.\nJudge:\nSo... the Ace Detective is actually an Ace Thief! Is this true, witness!?\nAtmey:\n... Aha... Hee hee hee ha ha ha Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ho ho ho hee hee hee! DeMasque's M. O. is pure genius! And so am I, Luke Atmey, Ace Detective!! You're very clever to have come to such a conclusion! I am impressed, Sir Lawyer!\nJudge:\nWh-Whaaaaat!? Witness! You... You're admitting it!?\nMaya:\nN-Nick! Now's your chance!\nPhoenix:\nYes! Time to put the last nail in this guy's coffin! Detective Atmey! When you assumed the thief's identity--\nGodot:\nGodot:\nGodot Blend #102... ...My personal favorite.\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Godot!\nGodot:\n\"The Ace Detective is actually an Ace Thief!\" I smell a best-selling novel! There's only one problem... It simply isn't true.\nJudge:\nB-But Mr. Godot! Mr. Wright has made some very strong points and I...\nGodot:\nI will admit my opponent has woven a compelling narrative out of whole cloth. But it is, in fact, nothing more than a patchwork quilt. Mr. Trite... If this detective really is the thief, then show us the proof of your claim. But it had better be as hot... and as perfect as the coffee dripping down your face!\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Wright!? Don't just stand there! This court would like to see this decisive proof you have! Quickly!\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? Oh! Y-Yes, of course! (Wh-What's the big rush...?)\nMaya:\nAre you alright, Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Atmey looks pretty rattled right now... I'd like to finish this right now if I can. But can I really do it?) The decisive evidence that proves Mr. Luke Atmey is in fact Mask☆DeMasque...\nPhoenix:\nProof? Of course I... I... ...I've got nothing.\nGodot:\nHa...! Just what I thought. A man has to told his head up high no matter how bad things get, after all.\nPhoenix:\nUuugh...\nJudge:\nI see... I thought perhaps you had some evidence to back up your assertion...\nPhoenix:\n(This is no good! I've got to stay on the attack! I'll never get another chance to prove that this guy is the thief!)\nMaya:\nDon't give up, Nick! Think harder and try again!\nPhoenix:\nIt's no good... I'm just not ready yet...\nMaya:\nB-But... Are you going to just give up and let us lose this?\nAtmey:\nSo, you've come to your senses, have you, Sir Lawyer?\nPhoenix:\nI... Unnngh... (Argh! I can't think of a counter-attack at all...)\nJudge:\nIt seems the cloud of suspicion surrounding this witness has lifted. Mr. Godot. If you have anything further to add, then--\n???:\nJudge:\nWh... Wh-Who... ...Who are you?\nDesirée:\nThat doesn't really matter right now, does it?\nPhoenix:\nMs. DeLite! What are you doing here?\nDesirée:\nNicky boy! The thing you've been looking for... I think I found it!\nJudge:\nYou mean... that bag!?\nDesirée:\nNo, not the bag! What's in the bag! ...Well?\nJudge:\nTh-That's...\nMaya:\nThe Sacred Urn!! Nick! It's the urn!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order! ...You! Madame...! That urn... Where did you find it!?\nDesirée:\nYou'll never believe it... It was in the office of Mr. Fancy Pants Ace Detective! ...Luke Atmey!\nRon:\nOh, Dessie! You're the best!\nSacred Urn updated in the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nWell? How do you explain that one, Mr. Atmey!?\nAtmey:\n...\nPhoenix:\nEven you are going to have a hard time weaseling out of this one!\nGodot:\nGodot:\nHa...! Pathetic...\nJudge:\nMr. Godot...? Do you have something you wish to say?\nGodot:\nYes, Your Honor... It simply amazes me how quickly times change... In the old days, a man was to be taken at his word. It's truly sad...\nJudge:\nYou're still denying that Mr. Atmey was involved!?\nGodot:\nBefore casting aspersions at Detective Atmey, consider the young lady here. Your name is Desirée... Desirée DeLite. Is that correct?\nDesirée:\nY-Yes! What about it?\nGodot:\nHa...! How charming... The lengths that a woman is willing to go to save her husband is truly inspiring.\nDesirée:\nWh-What are you insinuating!?\nGodot:\nAs the wife of the criminal, you could have \"discovered\" that stolen urn anywhere. Including the office of the good detective here. So you found the urn. What does that prove? It certainly doesn't prove where the urn was before you \"found\" it.\nDesirée:\nWhat...? I just brought it here from the detective's office!\nGodot:\nPlease Madame... This town is already filled to the brim with lies. Any more could only compound the tragedy we have been witness to.\nDesirée:\nYou're wrong! I would never...! I would never do such a thing!\nPhoenix:\nMs. DeLite...\nDesirée:\nPlease, Nicky boy! You've got to help me talk some sense into these people!\nPhoenix:\n(There must be some way! I've got to prove that urn was actually in the Atmey Detective Agency...)\nAtmey:\nSo what is all this fuss about fingerprints anyway...?\nPhoenix:\nMr. Atmey... Do you recall the events of yesterday?\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Come on! Open it up!\nPhoenix:\nHey! Wait a minute! We can't just open his private property!\nMaya:\nDon't be such a fuddy-duddy! This is an important investigation! Well? What's in there?\nPhoenix:\nH-Hang on a sec. I'm taking it out now... (Whatever it is, it feels... kinda hard... and smooth...)\nAtmey:\n...Well, hello there!!\nPhoenix:\nIt's true that I didn't get a chance to look in the bag at that time. But! I did touch what was inside.\nAtmey:\nWh-What!? Y-You touched it...?\nPhoenix:\nAnd I remember it very well. It was \"smooth and hard\".\nAtmey:\nW-Well, err... Th-That was just...\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! I'd like the court to examine the fingerprints on that urn. If my fingerprints are on there... Then it proves that the urn was in Detective Atmey's office!\nGodot:\nGodot:\nWell, even if your fingerprints are on the urn... ...it still doesn't prove when they were put there, does it?\nPhoenix:\nOf course it does.\nGodot:\nWh-What did you just say!?\nPhoenix:\nIt's not what I say, it's what Adrian Andrews, the person in charge of the exhibition said. (Changed from [Not what I said, it's what Adrian Andrews, the person in charge of the exhibition said.] in the original release)\nAndrews:\nI polished it until it was just about glowing... I thought maybe I could make it looks more valuable!\nPhoenix:\nIf she polished it that much, she must have removed any and all fingerprints on it. And the only chance I had to get my fingerprints on it after that was... Yesterday! At the Atmey Detective Agency!\nGodot:\nHa...! This blend... Godot Blend #107... I've decided... It's a little too bitter after all!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order! I accept the defense's request! Bailiff! Take this urn and...\nAtmey:\nWait! Wait a moment, Your Honor! ...There's no need for that.\nJudge:\nN-No need you say...?\nAtmey:\nPrecisely... I already know Mr. Wright's fingerprints are on the urn...\nJudge:\nWh-What are you saying!\nPhoenix:\n(Yes! I've finally broken him down!)\nAtmey:\nHee hee hee ha ha ha Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ho ho ho hee hee! Take a good look, everyone! Unable to find a rival worthy of my genius, I was forced to create one by myself! Here I am! The tragic clown...\nMaya:\nThis guy is nuttier than a fruitcake...\nAtmey:\nYou see! It was me all along! I am the one and only Mask☆DeMasque! Ha ha! I hope you all enjoyed my little performance! Hee hee hee ha ha ha Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ho ho ho hee hee hee!\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Godot... What's Mr. Atmey's condition?\nGodot:\nHe's still in the lobby, laughing insanely, Your Honor. I wish I could enjoy the joke as much as he seems to be.\nJudge:\nWell, it looks like the matter has been settled. I came perilously close to besmirching the record of an innocent young man. Besmirching him with the title of \"thief\"!\nMaya:\nNick, you were right after all!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah! I guess Mr. DeLite really wasn't the thief!)\nJudge:\nThe court finds the defendant, Mr. Ron DeLite...\n???:\nRon:\nYou're wrong! Wrong I tell you! Err, umm, I mean... Not exactly wrong so much, but actually not right is what I really trying to say\nPhoenix:\n(Oh no... He's not... This can't be happening...)\nRon:\nThe thief... The sneaky, odious thief who's been stealing all the treasures... It's me! I'm him! I'm the one you want! I'm the thief I tell you! So do it...! Pronounce me guilty! Pleeeease!!\nPhoenix:\n...\nGodot:\n...\n............\nJudge:\nI don't know what kind of a kangaroo court you all think this is, but...\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThe true identity of the thief has already been proven! Please hurry and pass judg--\nRon:\nWhat are you talking about!? I already confessed! I'm the thief I tell you!\nJudge:\n...Mr. Godot! Don't just stand there drinking coffee!\nGodot:\nHa...! Hey there, Mr. Thief...\nRon:\nY-Yes! Yes, sir!?\nGodot:\nIf you're really a man, then clean up your own mess.\nRon:\nI-I'm sorry... I'm afraid I just don't have any idea what do you mean.\nGodot:\nIf you are Mask☆DeMasque... then prove it. That's what it means.\nRon:\nY-Yes, sir! I'll be happy to!\nMaya:\nHe says he'll be happy to, Nick...\nPhoenix:\nIt's kinda cute... He's 100% committed to his fantasy.\nGodot:\nGood boy! Just remember one thing. A boy only gets one chance in his life to become a man!\nRon:\nI-I know that! I-I won't fail! I swear!\nGodot:\nOK, then... Talk! ...We're all listening.\nJudge:\nOh well... Let's all have a listen to this \"confession\"...\nWitness Testimony\n-- Mask☆DeMasque's Identity --\nRon:\nThe truth is, I've been Mask☆DeMasque all along!\nI mean, you can't prove that I'm not actually Mask☆DeMasque, can you?\nI don't have an alibi for the night the urn was stolen, after all!\nI donned my costume that night and dancingly descended upon the scene of the crime!\nLook! You can see right there in the photo! That's me!\nAs for my broach, I snagged it on the door handle and it got torn off, that's all!\nJudge:\nHmm... I don't like the direction this trial has taken...\nPhoenix:\n(But this is how every trial goes... At least with me, anyway...)\nGodot:\nHa...! You're doing great!\nRon:\nHee hee hee... Stop it, Mr. Godot... You're embarrassing me.\nGodot:\nLike I said, you're only going to get one chance to testify, alright? But if you make it through this with flying colors, I'll keep my promise, too. I'll make sure you stay locked up in prison as the one and only true Mask☆DeMasque!\nRon:\nThanks so much, Mr. Godot! I... I'll do my best!\nJudge:\nAlright, Mr. Wright. I'm afraid it's time for the cross-examination.\nPhoenix:\n*sigh*\nCross Examination\n-- Mask☆DeMasque's Identity --\nRon:\nThe truth is, I've been Mask☆DeMasque all along!\nRon:\nI mean, you can't prove that I'm not actually Mask☆DeMasque, can you?\nRon:\nI don't have an alibi for the night the urn was stolen, after all!\nRon:\nI donned my costume that night and dancingly descended upon the scene of the crime!\nRon:\nLook! You can see right there in the photo! That's me!\nRon:\nAs for my broach, I snagged it on the door handle and it got torn off, that's all!\nMaya:\nWhy does Mr. DeLite want to be Mask☆DeMasque so badly anyway? It's kinda disturbing. He doesn't seem like your typical attention whore to me. Unlike, say... you, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nI am nothing of the sort, thank you very much. (But I gotta admit it is kinda scary the way Ron acts...)\nMaya:\nAnyway... Time to poke some holes in that testimony of his!\nPhoenix:\nMr. DeLite. This wallet belongs to you, correct?\nRon:\nAh! Y-Yes. It-It does. I-I had lost it somewhere!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! When you find a wallet, you should report it to the police right away!\nPhoenix:\nAh! No! You don't understand. This is an important piece of evidence.\nJudge:\n\"Evidence\"...?\nPhoenix:\nMr. DeLite... When did you first notice that you'd lost your wallet?\nRon:\nErr, let's see... I think it was on the night of the crime... But I know I still had it when Dessie and I went out for dinner.\nPhoenix:\nThis wallet was found at approximately 1:00 AM at KB Security headquarters.\nJudge:\nWhat...!? Surely you're not serious!?\nPhoenix:\nYes... I am serious. This proves that Mr. DeLite was, in fact, at KB Security that night!\nRon:\nNoooooo!\nPhoenix:\nSo if the defendant was at KB Security at 1 o'clock in the morning... ...then that proves that he has a watertight alibi!\nRon:\nNoooooo!\nPhoenix:\nFurthermore, considering the distance between Lordly Tailor and KB Security... ...it would have taken 30 minutes to get there by car! (According to Larry anyway...)\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Godot!? Do you have anything to say? And stop drinking that coffee!\nGodot:\n...Come on, Mr. Thief. Don't let this guy beat you! Tell him why he's wrong!\nRon:\nYou're the only one who calls me \"thief\", Mr. Godot... ...Alright, I'll try! I-I'll do it! I will!\nMaya:\n...He's really got Mr. DeLite all worked up...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, he's like a kid at his first day of school...\nRon:\nLook, it's just ridiculous! Why would I have dropped my wallet at KB Security!? Someone must have planted it there to make it LOOK like I was there and not at the heist.\nMaya:\n\"Planted it there\"? He's really reaching now...\nPhoenix:\nMr. DeLite. You probably dropped your wallet when you took it out to use this, didn't you? The key card to KB Security's CEO's office.\nRon:\nNoooo!\nGodot:\nHa...! That was a pretty good try, Mr. Trite... Unfortunately, you've overlooked one small thing.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What...?\nGodot:\n\"Motive\" of course! Why would this thief go to KB Security in the middle of the night anyway!?\nJudge:\nHmm... Well, Mr. Wright? It looks like you need some more evidence after all.\nPhoenix:\n(Grrr! This stupid kid...!)\nJudge:\nNow then. Let's see your evidence. The evidence that shows why Mr. DeLite went to KB Security at 1 AM that night!\nPhoenix:\nMr. DeLite... I believe you've seen this before, correct?\nRon:\nAh...! Th-That's...!\nJudge:\nWhat is it?\nPhoenix:\nA blackmail letter. That's what it looks like from the contents.\nGodot:\nB-Blackmail...?\nPhoenix:\nYes, basically it says, \"bring $50,000 dollars\". [sic]\nJudge:\nHmm... That certainly sounds like blackmail alright...\nPhoenix:\nAt the time of the theft, Mr. DeLite was dealing with the blackmailer himself... ...in KB Security's CEO office, a full half an hour away from the scene of the crime!\nGodot:\n...Ungh... Urk... No No No No No NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! OOOOORDER!! So when the theft of the urn occurred, the defendant was at KB Security... It looks like a perfect case for the defense!\nGodot:\nGodot:\n...You may see it as a perfect case, Judge, but to me... Well, let's just say that my Godot Blend #107 impresses me a lot more.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What are you trying to say?\nGodot:\nYou say the thief was being blackmailed by the CEO of a security company... But... Did you actually investigate this CEO at all?\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? Well, umm... No... I guess not.\nGodot:\nAccusing a man of blackmail with no proof? I'm not sure what I think of that...\nPhoenix:\n(\"Not sure what I think of that\"...? At least I know what I think of you...)\nJudge:\nHmm... Good point. I'm not sure what I think of it myself... You claim that the defendant entered the CEO's office... ...but you will need at least one witness to corroborate your claim, Mr. Wright.\nMaya:\nNick! I think we're going to have to track down the CEO guy...\nPhoenix:\nNo, we don't have to track down the CEO at all.\nGodot:\nWhat do you mean by that, Mr. Trite?\nPhoenix:\nThere is someone else who can testify. This is the person who can testify that the key card was used at 1 AM that night!\nJudge:\nWh-Who is this useless-looking young man?\nPhoenix:\nYou don't remember him, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nHmmmm... Not exactly... But just looking at his picture makes the bile start to rise in my throat.\nMaya:\nIt looks like he doesn't remember the case from 2 years ago...\nPhoenix:\nHe probably blocked out that memory on purpose. Anyway, this man was working as a guard at KB Security that night.\nGodot:\nOh...?\nPhoenix:\nThe question at hand is this key card.\nButz:\nYup. That's the key card they use at the building I work in. According to the serial number, this one is for the CEO's office. You need it to get into that room, and every time you use that card, it leaves a record.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\nAs you can see, there's no need to investigate the CEO of KB Security! We should be able to discover the truth simply by analyzing this key card's data!\nGodot:\nBwaaaah...!\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Godot?\nGodot:\nThe name of the CEO of KB Security is Kane Bullard. I was unable to contact him directly, but... I got the key card data. ...Here.\nJudge:\nS-So what does it show!?\nGodot:\nEach key card has its own serial number and they leave detailed records of their use. According to this data... this card was used at 1 AM on the morning of the crime.\nKey Card updated in the Court Record.\nJudge:\nBut that means... it can't be Mr. DeLite dressed as Mask☆DeMasque in this photo!\nGodot:\nHa...! It looks like you're right. Two minutes isn't even enough time to brew a good cup o' Joe...\nPhoenix:\nSo... So then...!\nGodot:\nRon DeLite was clearly in the office of KB Security's CEO at the time of the crime. ...The prosecutor's office is ready to admit that fact. Therefore, it's impossible for the defendant to be Mask☆DeMasque.\nMaya:\nGood job! You did it, Nick!\nJudge:\n...That's enough! I came perilously close to besmirching the record of an innocent young man. Besmirching him with the title of \"thief\"! ...\nPhoenix:\nWh-What's wrong, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nI'm ready to pass judgement... But before I do that, do you have any further objections?\nPhoenix:\nNo, Your Honor!\nGodot:\nHrpmh...!\nRon:\nUnnnggh...\nJudge:\n...Very well. The court finds the defendant, Mr. Ron DeLite...\nNot Guilty\nJudge:\nCourt is now adjourned!

She's nobody... She's just ahh...\nPearl:\nYou're blushing! How dare you do this in front of Mystic Maya! You should be ashamed of yourself!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeowch! She slapped me...)\nMaya:\nUmm, Pearly... This woman is Ms. Desirée DeLite. She's our client's wife.\nPearl:\n*gasp!* Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes!?\nPearl:\nYou're even worse than I thought! Going behind the back of your own client...!\nPhoenix:\nN-N-No! You've got it all wrong!\nPearl:\nI'll never forgive you!\nPhoenix:\n(Owww... A double slap...)\nMaya:\nWell, anyway, All's well that ends well, right? We got the Sacred Urn back and the thief has been caught!\nDesirée:\nYou're so right! And it's all thanks to Nicky boy here!\nMaya:\nBut actually it was you, Ms. DeLite, that brought us our urn back! Thank you from the bottom of my heart!\nDesirée:\nOh, please... You're embarrassing me!\nPhoenix:\n(If we won the case... ...then why does this guy still look so glum...?)\nRon:\nUgggh... But I am the thief... Actually, what's the point now\nDesirée:\n...What is it, honey? I did my best for you, Ronnie!\nRon:\nI-I know that and I appreciate it, Dessie... But the thing is...\nGodot:\nCome on... Give the kid some time. He's just got a little touch of the blues. You know about feeling blue, right, amigo?\nPhoenix:\nM-Mr. Godot! What are you doing here!?\nGodot:\nOh come on! I just came here to say thanks to my newest buddy... ...You, Mr. Trite.\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe you should learn my name before you call me \"buddy\"...)\nGodot:\nWell, playtime is over.\nPhoenix:\nHuh...?\nGodot:\nEarly this morning... the body of Kane Bullard was discovered.\nMaya:\nKane Bullard...? Where have I heard that name before?\nDesirée:\nIsn't that... the name of the CEO of KB Security?\nMaya:\nWait. B-Body...!? (Changed from [B-Body...?] in the original release)\nGodot:\nThe estimated time of death was 1 AM on October 12th.\nPhoenix:\n1 AM on October 12th...? Y-You don't mean!?\nGodot:\n...That's right, amigo. At the same time that a cheap little urn was being stolen... ...the CEO of KB Security was being murdered.\nPhoenix:\nS-So then... What are you doing here?\nGodot:\nOh come on. You've figured it out already, haven't you amigo? Or... Have you already forgotten about that piece of info I helped you out with today?\nPhoenix:\n(\"Helped me out\"? What!?)\nGodot:\nOn October 12th, at 1 o'clock in the morning... Ron DeLite was in the CEO's office... ...The scene of the murder. After getting that blackmail letter, he must have been imbrued with utter rage.\nMaya:\nWh-What are you saying!? Imbrued with rage...?\nGodot:\nCome on! Don't tell me you didn't know! (Changed from [Come on! Don't tell me you didn't know it!] in the original release) Ron DeLite was once an employee of KB Security... He was a professional security guard.\nPhoenix:\n(An employee of KB Security!?)\nGodot:\nIt looks like the alibi that saved him from being convicted as a thief... ...is going to be the noose that gets him hanged. Kind of an \"anti-alibi\".\nMaya:\nNo way...\nGodot:\nHe can't be the thief because he was at the murder scene when the murder occurred!\nDesirée:\nN-No! Th-That's a lie! It can't be true!\nRon:\nOh! Ohhhh! B-But I... I am a thief I tell you!\nGodot:\nRon DeLite. You're going back to prison again. This time the charge is much more serious. This time you'll be tried for murder.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!? This can't... This is impossible!\nGodot:\nI'm looking forward to another exciting showdown, Mr. Trite!\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nYou and I aren't through with each other yet. Surely you won't back down from a challenge! You've never been a coward!\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Is there something personal between you two...?\nGodot:\nI've returned from the depths of Hell to do battle with you. ...At least let me have some fun while I'm here!\nPhoenix:\n(This guy... Who the heck is he!? He may be quiet... But he's the most dangerous enemy I've ever faced...)\nGodot:\nWell then... Time to say goodbye to Mr. DeLite.\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nN-Nick...!

He's probably working on the murder case.\nPhoenix:\nBut wasn't he in charge of the Mask☆DeMasque investigation all the way up to yesterday?\nMaya:\nWell, a murder case is a lot more exciting, isn't it?

Law Offices, clearing \"Sacred Urn\" Talk option in Lordly Tailor - Basement Warehouse, clearing \"Love at first sight?\" Talk option in Mask☆DeMasque's Hideout, clearing all Talk options and examining binder and button in KB Security - CEO's Office, and clearing \"Emergency buzzer\" Talk option in KB Security - Security Guard's Office:\nOctober 13Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nRon:\nAh! M-Mr. Wright!\nMaya:\nMr. DeLite... Did they finish their interrogation?\nRon:\nYes, but...! P-Please don't leave me alone anymoooooore!\nPhoenix:\n...Mr. DeLite, you lied to us before, didn't you?\nRon:\nW-Well... Err, you see...\nPhoenix:\nOn the same night the Sacred Urn was stolen from Lordly Tailor Department Store... ...a blackmail letter you got summoned you to KB Security to hand over some money. And then, that's where the CEO, Kane Bullard, was murdered. But... there's only one Ron DeLite, am I right? So the only question is... Where were you that night? This time I want to hear the whole truth... Your life depends on it.\nRon:\nO-OK...\nAfter clearing \"The night of the crime\", \"Why you were fired\", and \"Heist plans\" Talk options:\nPhoenix:\nRon, before we go, there's one more thing I want to ask you.\nRon:\nY-Yes...? B-But please don't hurt me...\nPhoenix:\nMr. Kane Bullard... Do you swear that it wasn't you who killed him?\nRon:\nY-Yes, of course! I could never...! I-I'm not lying! All I did was hide his body in the safe! But then I was afraid they'd discover what I did. So I turned myself in yesterday!\nMaya:\nUm, why?\nRon:\nWell, if the judge had ruled that I was guilty of robbery, then I'd have an alibi, right?\nMaya:\nHmm... I guess so. You're really clever, Mr. DeLite.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I have no choice but to take Mr. DeLite at his word.)\n???:\nMystic Maya!\nMaya:\nHey...! Pearly!\nPearl:\nI'm back!\nPhoenix:\nHey Pearls. So what have you been up to this whole time...?\nPearl:\nThe Sacred Urn, Mr. Nick! I took it back to Kurain Village to have it examined!\nMaya:\nAnd? And? What did you find out?\nPearl:\nWell there's no need to worry! They said it's the real urn!\nMaya:\nWhew! That's a relief! I was really worried!\nPearl:\nBut there's one small problem.\nMaya:\nProblem?\nPearl:\nUm, these cute little pink splotches... They said that it's paint... And that they were put on the urn recently!\nPhoenix:\nWhy are we talking about the pink splotches again? What's the big deal?\nMaya:\nWhat's the big deal!? We've gotta find out how they got there! That's the big deal!\nPearl:\nYes, Mr. Nick! We've gotta find out how they got there!\nPhoenix:\nO-OK, OK! We'll go find out how they got there!\nRon:\nP-Please don't forget about me...\nSacred Urn refiled into the Court Record.\nOctober 13Lordly TailorBasement Warehouse\nAndrews:\nOh, Pearl. How nice to see you.\nPearl:\nH-Hello there!\nAndrews:\nI haven't seen you around lately. What have you been up to?\nPearl:\nWell, actually... I was having this urn examined!\nAndrews:\n! O-Oh... I see.\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe if we take another good look at this urn... ...we can figure out the mystery of what actually happened here...)\nMaya:\nNick! Let's look around one more time!\nPhoenix:\nThe first time that we came down here... It was on the night that the Sacred Urn was stolen.\nPearl:\nBut Mr. Nick... There were no paint marks on the walls or floor of the warehouse when we were here.\nAndrews:\nWell, there's a good reason for that. On the day of the crime, around noon... ...that golden statue just happened to arrive from the mountain training hall.\nMaya:\nA-And?\nAndrews:\nI realized that the statue would be the perfect size for covering up the paint stains. That's why... I put it where you first saw it.\nMaya:\nI see... Now it makes perfect sense.\nPearl:\nUm, but there's still one thing I find strange...\nAndrews:\nWhat is it, Pearl?\nPearl:\nThe day after the urn was stolen, we came here again... At that time, the statue had been moved and the paint was clearly visible.\nPhoenix:\n(She's right about that...) Well, Ms. Andrews?\nAndrews:\nHuh! What? I, err... I don't know anything about that! I placed it there to cover the paint, so why would I move it again?\nMaya:\nWell then who was it? Who would have done it and why...?\nPhoenix:\n(On the day before the theft, the statue was definitely closer to the door! Then the next day, it was moved. But why...?)\nAmi Fey's Golden Statue updated in the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like... ...there's some connection between the Sacred Urn and the murder case.\nMaya:\nWh-Why? Why do you think so, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nBecause that night... the real thief, Ron DeLite, was at KB Security. ...So then why did another Mask☆DeMasque show up here? A lot of different things are pointing to one undeniable fact.\nPearl:\nOne undeniable fact...?\nPhoenix:\n(The murder trial is starting tomorrow, but... (Changed from [The murder trial is starting tomorrow...] in the original release) It looks like that thief is going to be making another appearance...)\nTo be continued."

You can't imagine how much I've suffered...\nYou... suffered?\nAnd now... the perfect opportunity presents itself. At last... I shall have my revenge!\nWhat!?\n...Merry Christmas.\nDecember 25, 10:08 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nMaya:\nHey, hey, Nick! Do you know if there's any good waterfalls around here?\nPhoenix:\nWaterfalls...? Dare I ask why?\nMaya:\nDuh, Nick! Isn't it obvious? I need a waterfall to stand under! Preferably a freezing one!\nPhoenix:\n... Oh... Is that part of your spirit medium training?\nMaya:\nOf course! Except, I've been slacking off lately... I need to brave the elements and be forged anew under the rushing spring waters!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Okay... I don't know about any falls per se, but Gourd Lake is pretty close...\nMaya:\nOh. Darn.\nPhoenix:\nSorry, but them's the breaks. Couldn't you just take a cold shower or something?\nMaya:\n... Good idea!\nPhoenix:\n(So much for the rushing spring waters...)\nTV:\nNext in the news... A large, unidentified animal was sighted at Gourd Lake! The town is buzzing with excitement! Locals are calling it \"Gourdy\" in a tip of the hat to Nessie, the Loch Ness monster. Though its namesake, Nessie, proved to be a hoax... locals are confident their Gourdy is the real deal. ...\nPhoenix:\n*yawn* Bor-ing. Can't they show real news for a change?\nMaya:\nNick?\nPhoenix:\n?\nMaya:\nThe water pressure's kind of low in that shower.\nPhoenix:\n... You want more pressure, huh? Why don't you go down to the fire department and have them spray you with the hose?\nMaya:\n... Good idea, Nick!\nPhoenix:\n(Apparently, Fey blood is no aid in detecting sarcasm...) (Changed from [Apparently, E.S.P. is no aid in detecting sarcasm...] in the original release)\nTV:\nWe interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin! Strange occurrences continue at Gourd Lake... But this time, it's murder!\nPhoenix:\n(Gourd Lake again?)\nTV:\nThe body of a man was found in the lake early this morning. A suspect was apprehended. Sources inside the police department revealed... that the suspect's name is Miles Edgeworth, age 24. Edgeworth was an up-and-coming prosecution attorney, known for his skill and connections. He was guaranteed a long and rewarding career... Has he thrown it all away?\nPhoenix:\n(...? E-Edgeworth!?) What's going on!? Edgeworth would never do something like--\nMaya:\nNick?\nPhoenix:\nYipes! M-Maya!\nMaya:\nThe fireman yelled at me when I called him.\nPhoenix:\nWe've got bigger things to worry about than that! They arrested Edgeworth!\nMaya:\nWhat? You mean, the prosecutor?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, he's a suspect... in a murder!\nMaya:\nWhaaaaat!? When? Where? Whom? Why? How?\nPhoenix:\nI-I don't know!\nMaya:\nLet's go find out, Nick!\nDecember 25Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nMaya:\nYou know, Nick... We've all been in here one time or another, haven't we?\nPhoenix:\nI guess it comes with the territory.\nMaya:\nI'm not sure it's something we should mention to too many people... Aah!\nPhoenix:\n... Hey! Edgeworth! Come back!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat are you doing here!?\nMaya:\nNick, I don't think he's in a very good mood.\nPhoenix:\nWell, he is in detention. Were you in a good mood when you were here?\nEdgeworth:\nSo, you've come to laugh at the fallen attorney? Then laugh, laugh! Well? Why aren't you laughing?\nMaya:\nNick... Should we be laughing?\nPhoenix:\nNah. It's a trick. Laugh and he'll get mad... or burst into tears. Edgeworth. We don't have so much free time we can spend it coming down here to laugh at you.\nEdgeworth:\n... Yes you do.\nPhoenix:\n(Actually, he's right.)\nEdgeworth:\n... I hoped you wouldn't come. I didn't want you to see me. Not like this.\nPhoenix:\n(I didn't want to see you like this, either. Believe me.) (Changed from [Hey, I didn't want to see you either, believe me.] in the original release)\nDecember 25Gourd Lake ParkEntrance\nMaya:\nThis is where it happened?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. Gourd Lake is in the middle of this park.\nMaya:\nI can see some police walking around in there.\nPhoenix:\nQuestioning people, probably.\nMaya:\nHey! Isn't that Detective Gumshoe over there?\nGumshoe:\nWell, pal!? There's enough of us here! Anyone found anything?\nPolice:\nS-sorry, sir... Nothing.\nGumshoe:\nIdiot! The trial's tomorrow! We need clues, on the double!\nPolice:\nB-but, sir... There weren't any clues... that's why we arrested that attorney, Mr. Edgeworth! It's clear, sir. He's the one who--\nGumshoe:\nShaddup! Just you try saying that again! I'll... I'll... I'll make you sorry if you do! (Changed from [I'll... er... I'll make you sorry if you do!] in the original release) So just... just, get outta my face, pal!

Aah!\nMaya:\nEek!\nGumshoe:\nHey, you're that Harry guy! Harry Butz!\nPhoenix:\nWright! Phoenix Wright! (Will he ever learn my name!?)\nGumshoe:\nAnd just what are you doing here, pal? Investigating!?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Um, well, yes. I suppose.\nGumshoe:\nWell, I'm here to help! Ask me anything you want! Bring it!\nMaya:\nHe seems different than usual. I wonder what's up? Umm... Mr. Edgeworth hasn't actually asked us to defend him yet...\nGumshoe:\nHuh!? Oh? Y-you don't say...\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPolice:\nDetective Gumshoe, sir!\nGumshoe:\nWhat? Find something!?\nPolice:\nUm, no, sir. Not yet. But there was a call from the precinct. They want to hold an investigation briefing...\nGumshoe:\nA briefing? Right! I'm off! Oh... Sorry, pal. I guess you heard. I gotta go. Any last things you want to ask me about before I head back?\nPhoenix:\nYou're not coming back, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nErm... Probably not, pal.\nPhoenix:\nSo, what should we do if we have something to talk to you about...?\nGumshoe:\nAh, right. Here, I'll show you how to get to the precinct. Come down and see me anytime.\nDetective Gumshoe gave you directions to the police station.\nPhoenix:\nOh, hey! Detective Gumshoe!\nGumshoe:\nW-what!?\nPhoenix:\nUm, we'd like to take a look around in the park. Can we walk around?\nGumshoe:\nYeah! No problem, pal. You got my permission.\nMaya:\nYou know, Nick. I think there's something to be said for talking to people when they're busy.\nPhoenix:\nYeah. They don't have time to think about not giving you information...\nMaya:\nRight! Now, let's get investigating!\nDecember 25Police DepartmentCriminal Affairs\nMaya:\n... Looks like Detective Gumshoe isn't here.\nChief:\nSomething wrong, miss? Hmm? Turning yourself in? Okay, what did you do? Shoplifting? Larceny? Public indecency...?\nMaya:\nN-no! None of those things! We're looking for Detective Gumshoe... is he around?\nChief:\nGumshoe? Oh yeah. He's in a meeting right now. I don't think he'll be out any time soon.\nMaya:\nOkay, we'll come back.\nChief:\nYou do that. Oh, and go straight home and stay out of trouble. No more shoplifting, you got that?\nMaya:\n... Do I look like a criminal or something?\nDecember 25Gourd LakePublic Beach\nMaya:\nWowsers! This is \"Gourd Lake\"?\nPhoenix:\nYup. I'm not sure it warrants a \"wowsers,\" though.\nMaya:\nHmm. Probably not. But hey, look at that snack stand!\nPhoenix:\n\"Samurai Dogs\"...?\nMaya:\nI wanna Samurai Dog! Please! I bet they're great!\nPhoenix:\nWith a name like Samurai Dog, how could they not be?\nMaya:\nThey're a little behind the times, though. The kids are all into \"The Pink Princess\" now. I mean, like, y'know!?\nPhoenix:\n(Nope.)\nWright & Co. Law Offices\nDetention Center\nDecember 25Boat Rental Shop\nMaya:\nNick... what is this place?\nPhoenix:\nA boat rental shop. Closed for Christmas it seems. I guess a murder taking place on one of the boats won't be good for business, either.\nMaya:\nBoats... I've never ridden on a boat.\nPhoenix:\nReally? Well, how about we go out on one when the trial is finished?\nMaya:\nHey, good idea! You bet!\nDecember 25Gourd Lake Woods\nMaya:\nI like it here, Nick. Look... someone's camping!\nPhoenix:\nThey've got guts, camping at the scene of a murder.\nMaya:\nHey, hey, Nick! If they were camping here last night, they might know about the murder!\nPhoenix:\n(That's true...) Good call, Maya. Let's go talk to them.\nPhoenix:\nThis camera has a mic and some sort of attachment. It must take pictures when triggered by a noise.\nMaya:\nWow! Cool! Let's try it out! *cough* \"Hi, I'm Nick!\" ... Maybe I'm not saying it loud enough. \"HEY! I'M NICK!!!\" ... Huh. NIIIIIIIIII......IIIIIIIIIICK!\nPhoenix:\nWill you stop that?\nMaya:\nMaybe it's broken?\nPhoenix:\nD-don't kick it! Maybe it isn't set up to respond to voices?\nMaya:\nWell what then? These things?

Don't try to play stupid with me just 'cause you think I'm some country bumpkin! Yeah, I know how y'all Yanks think! \"I say, those southern folks talk with that exaggerated drawl, why they must be dumb!\" Well let me tell you, just because I might be dumb don't mean we all are!\nMaya:\nN-Nick, help!\n???:\nAnd who are you, now? Her chaperone?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, uh, no, rather, uhh... we're sort of... friends?\n???:\nJus' figure out what y'all are gonna say and say it for bejeezum's sake! Gawd, I'd rather sit through one of papa's drawls than listen to you stutter all day.\nPhoenix:\n(Oh boy... I guess we should pay her for the film...)\n???:\nWatch it!\nPhoenix:\nYes ma'am. (On second thought, I'll pay later...)\nMaya:\nI'm really sorry!\nPhoenix:\nI, er, this is my badge.\n???:\nHuh? Aren't badges supposed t' be all shiny and impressive? You a cop or something?\nPhoenix:\nUmm... I'm a lawyer.\n???:\nWh-what!? Y'all ain't gonna try and pull one o' them lawsuits on me over that film now? Cause I'll have you know I'm a fighter and I wrassled meaner looking' things'n you!\nPhoenix:\nN-no, that's not it at all. We're here investigating a murder that took place here, on the lake.\n???:\nA murder...? ... Sounds cool! Why didn't y'all say that in the first place! Go ahead, ask me anything ya like!\nPhoenix:\n(Finally! Some cooperation!)\n???:\nYou too. Y'all can come out of hiding now. I won't bite. Hard.\nPhoenix:\n(Come to think of it, where did Maya get to?)\nMaya:\nS-sorry... I-I was feeling a little overwhelmed. The culture gap and all...\n???:\nNever you mind, honey. I kin' talk Yank for ya if... ahem... if it pleases you?\nMaya:\nTh-thanks. I think I'll be okay.\nLotta:\nGreat then! I'm Lotta, Lotta Hart, but y'all can call me Lotta! I'm here photographing meteor showers for a research project. Mighty pleased ta meet ya!\nPhoenix:\nLotta?\nLotta:\nYeah?\nPhoenix:\nSo, your camera... it triggers on loud explosion noises?\nLotta:\nAyup.\nPhoenix:\nActually, the victim in the case we're researching--he was shot with a pistol.\nLotta:\nA pistol...?\nPhoenix:\nRight. Now wouldn't a gunshot make a similar noise to our party popper...?\nLotta:\nI guess it would.\nPhoenix:\nYour camera... didn't get a picture of the murder, did it?\nLotta:\n... Hey! Y'all are pretty bright!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nLotta:\nI see what yer sayin'... Tell ya what, I'll have a look-see at my film.\nPhoenix:\nIt would have been a photo taken late last night...\nLotta:\nI checked 'em once, don't remember if there was anything on 'em though. But what if I got sumtin'! I could be witness to a genuine murder! Yeehaw! I'll go check that film. Y'all come back now, y'hear?\nMaya:\nShe went inside her SUV. I guess we should come back later...\nWright & Co. Law Offices\nAfter presenting Lotta's Camera in Gourd Lake Woods:\nDecember 25Police DepartmentCriminal Affairs\nMaya:\n... I guess Detective Gumshoe is still in that meeting.\nGumshoe:\nHey! Thanks for coming down, pal!\nMaya:\nDetective Gumshoe!\nGumshoe:\nWe just finished the meeting. For better or for worse...\nPhoenix:\n(I get the feeling we're in for some bad news...)\nWright & Co. Law Offices (after clearing \"The autopsy report\" Talk option in Police Department - Criminal Affairs)\nMaya:\n...\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it?\nMaya:\nOh. Nothing... Just, something's been bothering me. ... Could you show me that autopsy report once more? ... ... ... Hey! I-I remember now! This guy! This is a lawyer that was at that office Mia worked at! I met him once when I went there to hang out with Sis!\nPhoenix:\nThat office...? Wait! You mean Grossberg's office?\nMaya:\nRight! That guy!\nPhoenix:\n(That was the last name I expected to come up... Maybe I should go talk to him... for old time's sake.)\nDecember 25Grossberg Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nIt's been a while since I was here last. Mr. Grossberg is out as usual.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick. Look at the wall.\nPhoenix:\n(That painting is still missing... Mia must have known about the deal with Mr. Grossberg and Redd White... She kept track of all of White's extortion and blackmail rackets.)\nDetention Center\nAfter clearing \"The autopsy report\" Talk option in Police Department - Criminal Affairs:\nDecember 25Gourd Lake Woods\nLotta:\nHey y'all!\nMaya:\nLotta!\nLotta:\nWait up a sec! We got bingo!\nMaya:\nBingo...?\nLotta:\nMy automatic camera took two pictures last night!\nMaya:\nHey!\nLotta:\nThis is them. Take a look!\nPhoenix:\nWait...!\nLotta:\nSee? See? He's shooting him with that pistol!\nPhoenix:\nI-it looks like that, yes.\nMaya:\nBut you can't really tell who that is shooting.\nLotta:\nYeah, well there was enough fog out there last night t' strangle a bullfrog. But, y'know... Seeing these photos reminded me of something.\nMaya:\nWhat...?\nLotta:\nI saw the murder happen. I'm a witness!\nMaya:\nWhaaaaaaa!?\nPhoenix:\nA-are you serious!?\nLotta:\nCourse!\nPhoenix:\n(How do you forget... never mind.)\nLotta:\nY'all reckon I should tell the cops?\nLotta:\nHey, so, I'm off to talk to the cops. Y'all can have this photo. Later.\nPhoenix:\nW-w-wait! Lotta!\nLotta:\nWhat? Can't y'all see I'm kinda busy?\nPhoenix:\nT-tell us what you saw, too! Please?\nLotta:\nNice try, honey, but I wasn't born yesterday. I'm a witness, and that means I'm on the side of justice, and that means the cops! I'd sooner eat the south side of a north-bound skunk than tell you!\nMaya:\nL-Lotta!\nLotta:\nDon't let it get your skivvies in a bunch. Friends today, enemies tomorrow! Or was that the other way round? No matter. I'm gone! Hey! Maybe they'll let me do some testifying! Hot darn!\nMaya:\nShe left... ... Well, that's one more witness. What do we do now, Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Well, if she saw something, there's not much we can do about it. The question is: what exactly did she see...? I guess we'll find out in the trial tomorrow.)\nLake Photo added to the Court Record.\nDecember 25Gourd LakePublic Beach\nMaya:\nLooks like the police have given up their interviewing.

Want one? Gotta get money for dates, you know, My girl Kiyance deserves the best!\nPhoenix:\n(K-Kiyance...? Not another model, I hope...)\nButz:\nOh, Kiyance's a fine, fine woman, Nick. It was her idea that I wear this costume! She was all \"You go girlfriend!\" Y'know? She bought this costume for me!\nPhoenix:\nThat... that's great, Larry.\nMaya:\nWow! A Santa costume! She must be really nice!\nButz:\nWhoa! Cute! Nick! Who's she? She's not your...?\nPhoenix:\nNot my... what? N-no, she's not!\nMaya:\nI'm his partner, Maya Fey.

He's on the floor in a ball, shivering. I guess he doesn't do so well with earthquakes.\nPhoenix:\n(I've heard of running, but curling up in a ball?)\nMaya:\nWell, I guess we're done. Mr. Edgeworth doesn't seem like he's going to stand up any time soon. Let's go, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nUh.. right.

Says she came \"to talk to y'all after hearing what Mr. Wright had to say\"! What's this all about, pal!?\nPhoenix:\n(Lotta Hart...)\nGumshoe:\nWhy are you going around finding more witnesses!? You want to give Mr. Edgeworth the death sentence, pal!?\nPhoenix:\nN-no, not at all... Just... I mean, she did see something. There's nothing I can do about that. I can't go around covering up evidence!\nGumshoe:\nEr... You trying to say something about the way I do my job?\nPhoenix:\nNo sir!\nPhoenix:\nLook what I got.\nGumshoe:\n... Hey, you did it, pal! Glad I waited till the last minute to file those papers! I'll rip 'em up and start new ones for you!\nPhoenix:\nThanks, Detective. Well, see you in court tomorrow, then.\nGumshoe:\nGood luck, pal. Hey! You guys feel that earthquake a little while back? I was worried!\nMaya:\nWorried? We're fine! I've lived out here my whole life. I'm pretty used to them by now.\nGumshoe:\nOh, I wasn't worried about you two. I was worried about Mr. Edgeworth!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, right...) He did seem to over-react a little, now that you mention it.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, well, I'm not surprised. It was a pretty big quake. I'm going to go check on him. You two go eat and get your rest for tomorrow's trial. Later!\nMaya:\n... I wonder what it is with Mr. Edgeworth and earthquakes?\nPhoenix:\nI wonder... He was never that scared of them when he was in school.\nPhoenix:\n(Then again, I only really got to know him in 4th grade. (Changed from [Then again, I was only in the same class as him for 4th grade.] in the original release) He transferred to another school after that.

(ellipsis and question mark highlighted in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\nThat's right, Manfred von Karma. He's the best prosecutor there is. He hasn't lost a case in his 40-year career. He is a god of prosecution, Wright! A god!\nMaya:\nNot a single case?\nEdgeworth:\nHe'll do anything to get a guilty verdict, anything.\nPhoenix:\nHmm. Sounds like someone else I know, Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. You don't understand. I mean he'll really do anything. Manfred von Karma is a man to be feared.\nPhoenix:\n(That's quite a claim coming from someone who forges evidence...)\nEdgeworth:\nHe taught me what it really means to \"prosecute.\"\nPhoenix:\nWh-what!?\nEdgeworth:\nJust picture a prosecutor as vicious as me... multiplied by a factor of ten.\nMaya:\nUgh... So... so was he your teacher, then, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nSomething like that...\nMaya:\nAnd now he's trying to get you found guilty!? What a creep! Oh, wait... Maybe he's planning on losing on purpose to help you out.\nEdgeworth:\nNot a chance... He hasn't lost once in 40 years. 40 years! He's as ruthless as me, times twenty!\nMaya:\nThat's pretty ruthless...\nEdgeworth:\nLike I said. He's a god among prosecutors.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess that's something like Mia was to me. Speaking of Mia...) Um, Maya?\nMaya:\nUh huh?\nPhoenix:\nWe could really be using Mia's help right now... don't you think?\nMaya:\nOh...\nPhoenix:\n?\nMaya:\nI can't. Sorry. I tried, I really tried, but I couldn't reach.\nPhoenix:\nYou couldn't \"reach\"?\nMaya:\nI think it's because I haven't been training. My powers are weak again...\nPhoenix:\nOh man, what bad timing!\nMaya:\nI'm really sorry. I'll try my best!\nPhoenix:\nI hope so!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat are you whispering about?\nPhoenix:\nO-oh, it's nothing. Well, it's time. Let's head in...\nDecember 26, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3\nJudge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Miles Edgeworth.\nPhoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.\nKarma:\n...\nJudge:\nErr, Mr. von Karma? Is the prosecution ready?\nKarma:\n... Fool... You seriously think that I would stand here were I not completely prepared?\nJudge:\nR-right, my apologies!\nPhoenix:\n(He's even got the Judge scared!)\nJudge:\nVery well, your opening statement, please.\nKarma:\n... Decisive evidence... A decisive witness... What else could possibly be required?\nJudge:\nAh... er, nothing of course. That should be fine. The prosecution may call its first witness.\nMaya:\nWhat's with this guy? Is he royalty or something?\nPhoenix:\nHow am I supposed to fight against this!?\nKarma:\nI call the detective in charge of this case, Detective Dick Gumshoe.\nPhoenix:\n(Okay, Gumshoe's first... Let's see how this goes.)\nKarma:\nDescribe the incident. Now!\nGumshoe:\nY-yessir!\nPhoenix:\n(Detective Gumshoe looks nervous...)\nGumshoe:\nEr, please take a look at the map. The murder happened late Christmas Eve, around midnight. There was one boat in the very middle of the lake. There were two men on the boat. Now, there happened to be a woman camping here on the edge of the lake. At 12:10 AM, she heard two pistol shots. Then the boat started to move. It went towards the boat rental shop.\nKarma:\nHmm.\nOverhead Map added to the Court Record.\nKarma:\nTestify to the court about your arrest. Now!\nJudge:\nW-w-wait! Mr. von Karma...\nKarma:\nYes?\nJudge:\nActually, I'm the one that's supposed to be handling these proceedings...\nKarma:\nWrong. There is only one thing you need to do here. You will slam down your gavel and say the word \"guilty.\" That is your role!\nJudge:\nY-yes, of course. You're quite right.\nPhoenix:\n(No, he's not!!!)\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Arrest of Edgeworth --\nGumshoe:\nA man called into the station around 30 minutes after midnight.\nWe headed to the scene of the crime as fast as we could.\nThat's where we found Mr. Edgeworth.\nNow, I didn't suspect him of anything at all.\nBut... the next morning, a body was found in the lake.\nSo we had to arrest Mr. Edgeworth.\nJudge:\nHmm... I see. Very well...\nKarma:\nBegin your cross-examination, attorney. Now!\nJudge:\n...\nCross Examination\n-- The Arrest of Edgeworth --\nGumshoe:\nA man called into the station around 30 minutes after midnight.\nGumshoe:\nWe headed to the scene of the crime as fast as we could.\nGumshoe:\nThat's where we found Mr. Edgeworth.\nGumshoe:\nNow, I didn't suspect him of anything at all.\nGumshoe:\nBut... the next morning, a body was found in the lake.\nGumshoe:\nSo we had to arrest Mr. Edgeworth.\nGumshoe:\nThe murder weapon we found in the boat was decisive evidence.\nMaya:\nNick. Doesn't it seem like Detective Gumshoe is being a little vague?\nPhoenix:\nI bet von Karma is feeding him lines! His testimony's probably filled with landmines just waiting for me to press.\nMaya:\nWhat do we do?\nPhoenix:\nGrit our teeth and press, I guess. What else can we do?\nMaya:\nWell said, Nick! You're the man!\nAfter pressing fifth statement and pressing modified sixth statement:\nKarma:\nMembers of the court... We now have the pistol used in the murder, and the bullet found in the body! Detective!\nGumshoe:\nY-y-yessir!\nKarma:\nWas the bullet found in the body fired from this pistol?\nGumshoe:\nYes. The ballistic markings on the bullet match the pistol.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! What does he mean, \"ballistic markings\"?\nKarma:\nShocking! To imagine someone here does not know something as basic as ballistic markings!\nMaya:\nN-Nick! He's glaring at me!\nKarma:\nTsk... very well, I'll explain. Actually, Judge! You do it.\nJudge:\nEh? M-me? ... Erm, ahem. Ballistic markings are like the \"fingerprints\" of a gun. The barrel leaves distinctive marks on each bullet it fires. You can examine these \"ballistic fingerprints\" to see which gun fired the shot. It's quite accurate.\nKarma:\nIndeed. This leads to one, inevitable conclusion: the bullet found in the victim's heart... was, without a doubt, fired from this pistol. This pistol which, as you may recall, was covered with the defendant's own fingerprints!\nJudge:\nO-order! Order!\nPhoenix:\n(This is bad... This makes it look like Edgeworth did it!)\nKarma:\nWell, Judge?\nJudge:\nI'd say it's almost decisive, yes. Honestly, I could declare a verdict at this point. However...\nKarma:\nYou wish to hear the witness speak, no doubt. Very well. I am somewhat fatigued, and so I will take a brief break. I will call my witness after the recess. Which will last ten minutes. Judge!\nJudge:\nY-yes?\nKarma:\nWhat are you doing? A ten minute recess! Now!\nJudge:\nB-but, wait, I...\nKarma:\nJust bang your flimsy gavel and get on with it, man!\nJudge:\nY-yes! Ahem. This court will take a ten minute recess.\nPhoenix:\n(Who's running this court, anyway!?)\nDecember 26, 11:09 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth! What's going on here!? Your fingerprints were on the murder weapon!\nEdgeworth:\nUh... hmm...\nPhoenix:\nAnd that foggy photo makes one thing clear... The only one who could have shot that man was the person in the photo!\nEdgeworth:\nTrue...\nPhoenix:\nWas that you in the boat?\nEdgeworth:\n... Yes. It was me.\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nEdgeworth:\nBut... you must believe me. I didn't shoot him.\nPhoenix:\nTh-then who did!?\nEdgeworth:\nI... don't know.\nPhoenix:\nYou don't know!? Weren't you right there!?\nEdgeworth:\n... I heard a gunshot from very close by. Then... the other man fell from the boat. I can't say why, but... I thought, at the time, that he had shot himself!\nPhoenix:\nY-you mean it was a suicide!?\nEdgeworth:\n... That's the only explanation I can come up with.\nPhoenix:\nHuh... (How am I going to convince anyone of that!?) Say, Maya?\nMaya:\nHuh? Wh-what?\nPhoenix:\nAny progress with Mia?\nMaya:\nOh... Sorry. It's no good.\nPhoenix:\nUgh...\nMaya:\nI know... I'm no good for anything, am I, Nick? If I can't call my sister, I might as well not be here, right?\nMaya:\nI don't know anything about trials, or defense... What's more, I'm a spirit medium who can't even contact spirits...\nPhoenix:\nAww, everyone has their off days! I mean, I've just been getting lucky lately... But you never know when my luck is going to run out!\nMaya:\nReally...?\nEdgeworth:\nW-w-whoa! Wright! Don't jinx this case any worse than it already is! It's bad for my heart...\nPhoenix:\nOh? Oh! S-sorry... (Whoops!)\nJudge:\nCourt is back in session. Mr. von Karma, call your witness.\nKarma:\nYes. Will Ms. Lotta Hart take the stand?\nKarma:\nLotta Hart, you are a research student at a university?\nLotta:\nThat I am.\nKarma:\nGood. Begin by telling us what you saw the night of the incident. And don't add anything trivial or subjective. Understand?\nLotta:\n... Y'all need to learn some manners.\nKarma:\nUNDERSTAND?\nLotta:\nY-yeah, I understand, I understand!\nJudge:\nEr... very well. Your testimony, please.\nWitness Testimony\n-- Witness's Account --\nLotta:\nIt was Christmas Eve, just after midnight, I reckon.\nI was in my car.\nI heard this \"bang\" come up from the lake.\nWhen I looked out the window, I saw two gents in a boat.\nThen there was another \"bang\"...\nThere wasn't nary a thing on the lake but that boat.\nKarma:\nEnough.\nLotta:\nHuh?\nKarma:\nJudge! She happened to take a photo of the incident! This is that photo. Accept it as evidence.\nJudge:\nW-well! This is a surprise! This looks like... the very moment of the murder! O-Order! I will remove you from the court if I do not have order immediately!\nKarma:\nAs the witness testified, she looked at the lake when she heard the shot. There were no other boats on that lake! So, the man in the boat with the victim must have been the one who shot him... Yes. It was the defendant, Miles Edgeworth!!!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order...! I will have order!\nKarma:\n... Well, Judge?\nJudge:\nThe evidence is... decisive. I have very little doubt about this case. Very well, this court finds the defendant...\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nW-wait! Your Honor! I haven't cross-examined the witness yet!\nKarma:\nA cross-examination? We have photographic proof! What question can there possibly be!? This photo is worth a thousand words... and they all read \"guilty\"! You lose. Or... Do you claim to have found a contradiction in her testimony!?\nPhoenix:\n...!\nKarma:\nVery well. If you have to, you may cross-examine the witness. You will only flounder and ask meaningless questions! You will fail to find anything! And then, I will have you held in contempt of court!\nMaya:\nUh, Nick... contempt...?\nPhoenix:\n\"Contempt of court,\" you know?\nMaya:\nI... guess I understand. Well... what are you going to do? Do you really think there was a contradiction with the facts in her testimony?\nPhoenix:\nI understand... I will cross-examine the witness!\nKarma:\nTsk tsk tsk... Very well!\nJudge:\nI pray for your sake this isn't a waste of time.\nCross Examination\n-- Witness's Account --\nLotta:\nIt was Christmas Eve, just after midnight, I reckon.\nLotta:\nI was in my car.\nLotta:\nI heard this \"bang\" come up from the lake.\nLotta:\nWhen I looked out the window, I saw two gents in a boat.\nLotta:\nThen there was another \"bang\"...\nLotta:\nThere wasn't nary a thing on the lake but that boat.\nPhoenix:\n(Th-there weren't any contradictions in there!)\nMaya:\nSorry, Nick. If only my sister were here...\nPhoenix:\n(Maya's really taking this hard.)\nAfter selecting \"Press further\" upon pressing second, fourth, and sixth statements, and pressing fifth statement:\nJudge:\nEnough! I think we've heard all we need to hear, Mr. Wright. It seems you are unable to find a contradiction in the testimony worth noting.\nPhoenix:\nB-but, Your Honor!\nKarma:\nYou keep your promise!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. I am afraid that I will have to penalize any further outbursts... By holding you in contempt of court!\nKarma:\nAnd if that happens, you'll have to leave the courtroom immediately! Understood...?\nPhoenix:\nUh... uh huh.\nMaya:\nNick...! Lotta's testimony is fishy, Nick! Real fishy!\nPhoenix:\nI... know what you mean. But... If I can't say anything, what can I do?\nJudge:\nI believe we've covered the evidence sufficiently to make a decision.\nKarma:\nThen, pass your judgment!\nJudge:\nVery well. Mr. Miles Edgeworth, please take the stand.\n???:\nJudge:\nWh-who was that!?\nMaya:\nIt... was me.\nPhoenix:\n(Maya!)\nJudge:\nI-is something wrong? D-do you need to use the facilities?\nMaya:\nNo, I do not! Lotta Hart! Your testimony stinks! It's unclear whether you were actually looking at the lake! It's highly doubtful that you actually say Mr. Edgeworth! Tell us the truth! This is a matter of life or death!\nLotta:\n...!\nMaya:\nLotta! Did you really clearly see Mr. Edgeworth that night!? Did you see him fire that pistol!?\nJudge:\nYou will stand down! The court does not acknowledge the defense's outburst!\nMaya:\nAnswer me, Lotta!\nLotta:\nWhat's the big idea, treating me like some kind of criminal!? I saw him! I swear it! I saw Edgeworth...\nKarma:\nKarma:\nEnough! Judge... Declare the defense in contempt of court!\nJudge:\nY-yes... yes, of course. I'm sorry, but you WERE warned. Guard! Escort Mr. Wright out of the courtroom! He is in contempt of court, and must leave.\nPhoenix:\n(No... No...!)\nWait!\nMaya:\nI-I was the one who made the outburst, Your Honor! Nick is innocent!\nKarma:\nHah! What's the difference? All that remains is for the guilty verdict to be declared! Isn't that right, Mr. Phoenix Wright!?\nPhoenix:\nDid you hear what Ms. Hart just said? She said she clearly saw Mr. Edgeworth! That was not in the testimony! That changes her testimony, and I have a right to cross-examine her again!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order! Order! Order! Order!\nKarma:\nYou're in contempt of court! It's too late for wild claims! Judge! Sustain my objection!\nJudge:\n... ... I'm sorry, Mr. von Karma, but I cannot.\nKarma:\nWhat!?\nJudge:\nMs. Lotta Hart has made a new testimony. The defense does have a right to cross-examine her again.\nKarma:\nB-but he is in contempt of court!\nMaya:\nNo, I am! If you're going to arrest someone, arrest me!\nJudge:\nHmm... Very well. Maya Fey! You will leave the courtroom immediately.\nMaya:\nNick! I did what I could... You have to do the rest! Good luck!\nPhoenix:\nM-Maya...!\nKarma:\nPeh! I care not for this melodrama! Listen well, Mr. Wright! I do not tolerate badgering of my witnesses!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm running out of time... I'd better find a contradiction in here or else...)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Begin your cross-examination!\nCross Examination\n-- That Last Statement --\nLotta:\nI saw it clear as day. The man on the boat was Mr. Edgeworth!\nPhoenix:\n(That's it...? Uh oh. I don't know if I can find anything in that... What will Maya say...?)\nPhoenix:\nGot you. Got you, Ms. Hart! Finally!\nLotta:\nWh-what!? You got what?\nPhoenix:\nLook at this photograph.\nLotta:\nThe photo I took...?\nPhoenix:\nThe very same. There's something I want you to see in this photo... it's quite clearly visible. The fog, Ms. Hart.\nLotta:\nSo... so?\nPhoenix:\nThis picture was taken with professional, high quality film, correct? Yet even it could not capture the faces of the men on the boat! Yet you claim you saw Mr. Edgeworth! How!?\nLotta:\nWhut!? Wha--!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright has a point!\nKarma:\nKarma:\nThat's why I told her not to say that in her testimony! Please!\nPhoenix:\nYet, now she has said it, Mr. von Karma. How could you possibly see Mr. Edgeworth!? Explain yourself!\nJudge:\nMs. Hart.\nLotta:\nWhat!\nJudge:\nCould you see the defendant that night?\nLotta:\nO-of course! I said I could and I meant I could!\nJudge:\nThen, please testify as to the circumstances of your sighting.\nPhoenix:\n(I did it! I finally found a hole in von Karma's carefully vague testimony!)\nWitness Testimony\n-- How Edgeworth Was Seen --\nLotta:\nYer right. It was a cold night, and the fog was thick as grits.\nSo, once I was finished setting up my camera, I got back in the car.\nStill, I brought my binoculars with me.\nWhen I heard that noise out on the lake, I looked with my binoculars.\nSee? No problem!\nJudge:\nHmm...You used binoculars? Very well. You may begin your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(This one'd better be good!)\nCross Examination\n-- How Edgeworth Was Seen --\nLotta:\nYer right. It was a cold night, and the mist was thick as grits.\nLotta:\nSo, once I was finished setting up my camera, I got back in the car.\nLotta:\nStill, I brought my binoculars with me.\nLotta:\nThe camera was set up to take pictures of a meteor shower.\nLotta:\nWhen I heard that noise out on the lake, I looked with my binoculars.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't care how many von Karmic objections I get... I'm going to find a hole in this testimony if it's the last thing I do!)\nLotta:\nOoof!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! What are you driving at?\nPhoenix:\nThe witness was not at the lake to photograph shooting stars, Your Honor!\nLotta:\n...!\nJudge:\nW-well then, what exactly was she photographing?\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! Take a look at this... What was Ms. Hart trying to photograph at the lake?\nPhoenix:\nMs. Hart. This is what you were trying to photograph!\nJudge:\nWhat's this? A newspaper article? \"Gourdy\"...? Ah, the sighting at Gourd Lake...\nPhoenix:\nWell, Ms. Hart?\nLotta:\nI... I never heard of no lake monster! You got proof or something? Let's see you prove that I was down at the lake trying to photograph this \"Gourdy.\"\nJudge:\nVery well, let's see it. And... no joking around this time, please. Here is proof that the witness was trying to photograph Gourdy, the lake monster!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! I see... I, too, thought it was a little strange.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, sure!) Well, Ms. Hart? You were camping there to try and take a photo of Gourdy, weren't you?\nLotta:\n... Yeah. Not bad. Are all you lawyers that smart? So, smart boy, I was down there trying to photograph Gourdy, you got me. So what?\nPhoenix:\nHuh...?\nLotta:\nThat don't change what I saw, does it?\nKarma:\nExactly! What you just used several precious minutes of our time to prove... is nothing more than that the witness is an idiot who thinks monsters exist!\nLotta:\nH-hey!\nKarma:\nBut, as she so succinctly said, so what!? It changes nothing!\nPhoenix:\n(Not true! You were hiding the whole thing about Gourdy for some reason, I know it! But what could it have been...? Whatever it is, I'm getting to the bottom of this!)\nJudge:\nMs. Hart. Why did you hide the fact that you were searching for Gourdy from the court? Please revise your testimony.\nLotta:\n... Right. Fine, I'll testify. It won't change nothing, though.\nPhoenix:\n(Something will change... it has to! And I'm going to spot it!)\nKarma:\n...\nWitness Testimony\n-- Lotta's New Testimony --\nLotta:\nActually, I'm not a research student at a university.\nI'm an investigative photographer.\nImagine what a scoop it'd be if I got a picture of that monster!\nThat's why I was camping out by the lake.\nBut, that's all I was hiding.\nWhen I heard the \"bang\" I looked right straight out at that lake.\nThere wasn't much else to look at, so I just watched that boat the whole time.\nThen I saw a flash, near one of the men's hands, and I heard another gunshot.\nI was looking right at that boat, the whole time, cross my heart and hope to fry.\nJudge:\nHmm... Well, Mr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.\nKarma:\nKarma:\nThe witness's testimony is unchanged from before! Whether she is a research student or a photographer has no bearing on this case! There is no need to waste more of our time with another pointless cross-examination!\nJudge:\nEr... hmm.\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nI claim the defense's right to cross-examine the witness, Your Honor! (von Karma's up to something, I know it! He doesn't want me to cross-examine her because... why? Was there a contradiction?)\nJudge:\nVery well. You may begin the cross-examination. You seem sure of yourself, you must have something in mind.\nKarma:\nHah! That would be a first!\nPhoenix:\n(Hah hah, very funny.)\nJudge:\nYou understand that this is your last chance at a cross-examination, Mr. Wright? If there is no problem with the testimony this time, we will let the witness leave. I will announce my verdict at that time, Mr. Wright. Understood?\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.\nCross Examination\n-- Lotta's New Testimony --\nLotta:\nActually, I'm not a research student at a university.\nLotta:\nI'm an investigative photographer.\nLotta:\nImagine what a scoop it'd be if I got a picture of that monster!\nLotta:\nThat's why I was camping out by the lake.\nLotta:\nBut, that's all I was hiding.\nLotta:\nWhen I heard the \"bang\" I looked right straight out at that lake.\nLotta:\nThere wasn't much else to look at, so I just watched that boat the whole time.\nLotta:\nThen I saw a flash, near one of the men's hands, and I heard another gunshot.\nPhoenix:\n(I'd better find some sort of contradiction in this testimony... I won't be able to beat von Karma any other way... There has to be something!)\nPhoenix:\nMs. Hart! Were you REALLY looking at that boat!?\nLotta:\nW-what's with you!? Course I was looking at it! It was the only thing out there! Any normal person'd be looking at it!\nPhoenix:\nI agree, any normal person would. But you are far from normal!\nLotta:\nWh-what!? Y'all wanna step over here and say that!?\nPhoenix:\nYou were camping at the lake to take a picture of Gourdy! Think about it-- What would you do if you heard a loud noise? You'd be scanning the lake for any sign of Gourdy, that's what! You wouldn't give the boat a second thought!\nLotta:\nAah!\nJudge:\nOrder! Continue, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nYou testified that you were watching the boat through binoculars! However, you wouldn't need binoculars to watch that boat! You needed them to search for Gourdy... and that's what you were doing!\nLotta:\n...! ... ...\nPhoenix:\nWell!?\nLotta:\nHmph... Well, now that y'all mention it... I did sort of take my binoculars and kind of scan the lake a bit... I mean, Gourdy might be out there, n' all...\nJudge:\nM-Ms. Hart! A-are you saying that you were NOT watching the boat, then?\nLotta:\n... S-sorry, y'all. I wasn't fibbing, really. I was, just... I thought y'know, I could be witness to a murder n' all! I kinda got excited. I was sure I was watching that boat... till now.\nJudge:\n... This... this is totally uncalled for--\nLotta:\nB-but hey! You got the photograph! You got proof!\nJudge:\nHmm... Still, we can't see who is shooting who in this.\nLotta:\nRight! Right! That's why I took this photo n'...\nKarma:\nKarma:\nWitness... That's enough. You've had a long day. Shut your pie-hole.\nLotta:\nSh-shut my what!?\nPhoenix:\n(What was she going to say? She took the photo... and what? Wait a second...)\nGumshoe:\nShe even had a photograph to prove it.\nPhoenix:\nBut you really can't tell from the photo who is shooting.\nGumshoe:\nThat's why she said she's going to enlarge the photo. She said \"it'll drop the quality a mite, but should let us see who's who!\"\nPhoenix:\n(She enlarged that photo! Why won't von Karma let her show it? I've got a hunch! I bet that enlarged photo shows something bad for von Karma! This is my chance! If I'm wrong, though, it'll mean prison for Edgeworth... or worse. What should I do!?)\nPhoenix:\nMs. Hart! Look at this photograph. You enlarged this photograph, did you not?\nLotta:\nY-yeah! I did!\nPhoenix:\nWhy has that enlargement not been presented to the court!?\nKarma:\nKarma:\nB-because it does not exist!\nLotta:\nWhat're y'all talking about!? You were the one who told me not to show it in court in the first place! You old fool!\nJudge:\nWhat's the meaning of this, Mr. von Karma!\nKarma:\nEr... erm...\nPhoenix:\nMs. Hart! Show the photo to the court! Show us the enlargement!\nKarma:\nKarma:\nThe prosecution objects to the submission of this evidence!\nJudge:\nObjection... denied. The witness will show the enlargement to the court.\nLotta:\nHere it is.\nJudge:\nHmm. We still cannot see who is firing in this. It could be the defendant... or maybe it's not. Regardless, I'll accept this as evidence.\nLake Photo added to the Court Record.\nKarma:\nHappy now, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nHmm... (There has to be something!)\nKarma:\nYou asked for the enlargement, you got the enlargement. And little good it has done any of us! That's why I requested she not show it!\nJudge:\nHmm... I suppose this means that the cross-examination...\nKarma:\nIs over! Obviously!\nJudge:\nThen, I would like to close the cross-examination of Ms. Lotta Hart.\nKarma:\nAnd none too soon. That was a flagrant waste of my time.\nJudge:\nMr. von Karma, do you have anything to add?\nKarma:\nI stated everything I needed to when this trial began. Decisive evidence. A decisive witness. What else could possibly be required?\nJudge:\nNothing, of course. Then, I believe it is time for me to declare my verdict.\nPhoenix:\n(Wait... it's not supposed to go like this! There has to be a clue in this photo... somewhere! This is bad! Real bad! What should I do!?)\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! There is something decidedly strange with this enlargement!\nJudge:\nW-what might that be? Mr. Wright... You will show the court what you mean! What about this photo is \"strange\"?\nPhoenix:\n(Okay... here goes nothing! I'll show the judge what's strange about this photo.)\nPhoenix:\nHere, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nThe shooter...? I'm not sure I understand. What about the shooter is strange?\nPhoenix:\nLook at the hand holding the pistol, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nThe hand...?\nPhoenix:\nThat hand directly contradicts another piece of evidence!\nJudge:\nThis man's left hand does what...!?\nPhoenix:\nLet me show you. I'll show you the evidence that left hand contradicts!\nPhoenix:\nThe evidence is clear. The man in this photograph is holding that pistol in his left hand. However! The prints on the murder weapon were from Edgeworth's \"right hand\"! Ergo! The man shooting the pistol in this photograph... Is not Mr. Edgeworth!!!\nJudge:\nNow that everyone in the courtroom has quieted down... I would like to reconvene this court of law! Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nYou have given us definitive proof today. We now know that it was not Mr. Edgeworth who fired the pistol that night. However... This leaves us with a rather large problem. If Mr. Edgeworth didn't do it, then who shot our victim?\nKarma:\nPrecisely! As we have seen, there were no other people on the lake that night! Who but the defendant could have shot the victim!?\nPhoenix:\nThere is only one explanation remaining! The man who shot the victim was none other than... the victim himself!!!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! So... you are saying that the victim committed suicide?\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. I can think of no other explanation.\nJudge:\nHmm... Indeed, that does seem to be the only remaining option.\nKarma:\nKarma:\nI'm so very, very sorry, Mr. Wright. But suicide is out of the question.\nPhoenix:\nWh-what!?\nKarma:\nAn examination of the victim's wound reveals the distance at which he was shot.\nPhoenix:\nThe... distance?\nKarma:\nThe victim was clearly shot from further than a meter away!\nPhoenix:\nA meter! Th-that's three feet!\nKarma:\nThere is no way it could have been suicide!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Mr. von Karma! Are you sure of the accuracy of your data!?\nKarma:\nOf course! I had already considered the possibility of suicide, you see.\nAutopsy Report updated in the Court Record.\nJudge:\nHmm... I see. Very well, allow me to state my opinion. Considering the situation, the shooter had to be the defendant, Mr. Edgeworth. However! The prints on the gun reveal that the shooter was not Mr. Edgeworth. This is a conundrum. Therefore, I would like to suspend proceedings for this trial for the day. The court orders the defense and the prosecution to further investigate this matter. Understood?\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.\nKarma:\n...\nJudge:\nThat is all. The court is adjourned.\nDecember 26, 1:15 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2\nPhoenix:\nWhew, that was a close one.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nHey! Don't you have anything to say!?\nEdgeworth:\nNo. I have yet to be declared innocent, Wright.\nPhoenix:\nWell, yeah, but... What happened out there on that lake, anyway!? If he didn't commit suicide, then who...? The shooter was about a meter away, too!\nEdgeworth:\n... W-what? Don't give me that look! I did not kill him!\nPhoenix:\nI was just kidding around.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph.\nPhoenix:\nLook... I'm going to go check on Maya.\nEdgeworth:\nOh... Wright.\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nEdgeworth:\nTell her something for me.\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nEdgeworth:\n... ... ... Tell... Tell her to watch what she says in court. That's all.\nPhoenix:\n(Would it kill you to just state how you really feel with a \"thanks\", Edgeworth?) (Changed from [Yeah, I'm sure she'll be happy to hear you say that, Edgeworth. Jerk!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nI requisitioned a transcript of Lotta's entire testimony. I thought it might give me some ammunition for the trial tomorrow. Of course she didn't see the shooter... So the only part of her testimony that stood was the \"bang\" she heard.\nLotta's Deposition added to the Court Record.\nTo be continued.\n\nDecember 26Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\nMaya!\nMaya:\nHey!

(Changed from [Though you did save Edgeworth, I guess...] in the original release) I just wasn't sure how to thank you... you know?\nPhoenix:\nEr... thanks.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nGumshoe:\nI'm going to head back to the station. I'll get the report on Maya and get her out of there as soon as I can.\nPhoenix:\nThank you. Oh, wait! Umm... I was wondering, how much is bail going to be?\nGumshoe:\nDon't worry about that. Mr. Edgeworth is posting the whole amount.\nPhoenix:\nWhat? Edgeworth...?\nGumshoe:\nDidn't I tell you? He's grateful to her for what she did. Alright, pal. Well don't forget to go pick her up, okay?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm...

Oh, that reminds me... Thanks for bail.\nPhoenix:\nThank Edgeworth.\nMaya:\nHuh?\nPhoenix:\nHe posted bail for you. Said he was grateful for what you did.\nMaya:\nMr. Edgeworth did that...? ...

I'll behave.\nPhoenix:\n(Oh dear...)\nDecember 26Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\nLooks like Edgeworth is in questioning.\nMaya:\nLet's come back later.\nPhoenix:\nGuess so...\nDecember 26Gourd Lake ParkEntrance\nMaya:\nThere aren't many cops around today, are there?\nPhoenix:\nThey're probably back at the precinct, working up the case against Edgeworth.\nMaya:\nMmm...\nLotta:\nHey y'all!\nMaya:\nHey, it's Lotta!\nLotta:\nY'all really did it today...\nPhoenix:\nWh-what did we do now?\nLotta:\nNaw, I'm not complaining! See, I did a little thinking. A little... self-reflection, you might say. I realized that bein' a witness is a mighty big responsibility. But I just went up there and started blabbing any old thing that came to mind.\nPhoenix:\nLotta...\nLotta:\nSo, you see, I want to make it up to y'all.\nPhoenix:\n\"Make it up\"...?\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nLotta:\nThe only fair exchange for information is... information! Listen good-- What I need from you is information about Gourdy!\nMaya:\nWhoa-whoa-whoa! G-Gourdy!?\nPhoenix:\nB-but Gourdy doesn't... I mean, Gourdy might not exist!\nLotta:\nThen bring me proof that shows he don't!\nPhoenix:\nUh...\nLotta:\nI'll be keepin' watch from the car, okay? You see something, y'all come to me first, got it?\nPhoenix:\nO-okay...\nLotta:\nRight! See y'all later!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nOkay, Nick, let's get hunting!\nPhoenix:\nH-hunting...? You don't seriously mean...\nMaya:\nGourdy? I sure do!\nPhoenix:\nWhat about Edgeworth!?\nMaya:\nWe're searching for Gourdy for him, Nick! Don't you get it!?\nPhoenix:\n(Okay... and how exactly do we search for a make-believe monster...? Maybe we can find a monster myth specialist?)\nDecember 26Gourd LakePublic Beach\nPhoenix:\nWh-what's that?\nMaya:\nTh-the Steel Samurai, Nick.\nButz:\nYo! Maya!\nPhoenix:\nLarry! What the heck is that!? (Changed from [Larry! What the heck is this!?] in the original release)\nButz:\nOh, it was my girl Kiyance's idea... She was all \"if you like, put this here, it would be, like, really cool!\" Dude, she gave it to me along with the banner!\nMaya:\nWow! That's really impressive she could find those for you!\nButz:\nWell, she knows a lot of people. And that show's finished now, so she got 'em for free.\nPhoenix:\nRight...\nDecember 26Boat Rental Shop\nMaya:\n... It’s always so quiet, here. I wonder if the boat shop is closed for good?\nPhoenix:\nWell, with the murder on the lake and all... They're probably just taking a vacation till it blows over.\nMaya:\nI get it.\nAfter clearing \"Making it up\" talk option in Gourd Lake Park - Entrance:\nDecember 26Gourd Lake Woods\nLotta:\nHey y'all! Well? Y'all find anything out about Gourdy?\nMaya:\nUmm... no, nothing.\nLotta:\nWell, keep moving! It gets cold out here at nighttime.\nMaya:\nIt is a little chilly... I... I think I have to sneeze!\nLotta:\nWh-whoa! No you don't! No sneezing!!!\nMaya:\nWhaaa-cho!\nklik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik\nMaya:\n...\nLotta:\nI told y'all NO SNEEZING! See, I set the camera to respond to things a little softer than a \"bang.\" It'd trigger on one of von Karma's finger snaps now!\nMaya:\nOh... I'm sorry.\nLotta:\nYeah, well, sorry's nice but what about my film!?\nMaya:\nNick... pay the lady.\nPhoenix:\n(*sob*)\nDecember 26Police DepartmentCriminal Affairs\nGumshoe:\nHey there, pal. What's up? You look out of sorts. Wait... you didn't go and do something that's going to hurt Mr. Edgeworth's case again!\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean, \"again\"!?\nGumshoe:\nWhatever, have a seat, pal. I'm here for you if you need anything. Besides money, that is.\nGourd Lake Public Beach\nGourd Lake Woods\nBoat Rental Shop\nAfter Air Tank is added to the Court Record:\nDecember 26Police DepartmentCriminal Affairs\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Detective Gumshoe isn't here...\nMaya:\nNow that you mention it, didn't he say he had a meeting to go to?\nPhoenix:\nAh, that's right... Let's come back later.\nGourd Lake Public Beach\nGourd Lake Woods\nPhoenix:\nSo, tell us this \"information\" you have.\nLotta:\nA promise is a promise, I guess... I overheard the cops around here saying something about the witness tomorrow... They said he's the caretaker of the boat rental place up the path here.\nMaya:\nBoat rental...? There's someone there? I mean, it looks so deserted.\nLotta:\nJust an old guy, living all by himself. Y'all should go check it out.\nMaya:\nThanks, Lotta! We will! Let's get cracking, Nick!\nLotta:\nHold on.\nPhoenix:\nSomething else?\nLotta:\nYeah... the night of the murder. My camera clicked twice, you know.\nMaya:\n...! Wait... so you have another photo?\nLotta:\nWell... Yeah, but there's nothing in it at all. Just the lake. I figured it wouldn't be much use as evidence, so I kept it to myself. Well, it might not be helpful at all, but... Here, take it.\nSecond Lake Photo added to the Court Record.\nLotta:\nBye now. Y'all take care. Time for me to pack up and leave.\nMaya:\n... Poor Lotta...\nPhoenix:\nIt's all Larry's fault. The legend still lives on, I guess.\nMaya:\nThe \"legend\"...?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, the legend of Larry, familiar to all who know him for any length of time... \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\"\nMaya:\nHmm. Someone should whip that Butz into shape.\nDecember 26Boat Rental Shop\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! This is the boat shop that Lotta was talking about!\nPhoenix:\nYou're right. Doesn't seem to be anyone around at all.\nMaya:\nWell, let's go check it out anyway!\nDecember 26Caretaker's Shack\nUncle:\nMeg! That you!?\nMaya:\nEeeek!\nUncle:\nHey, is that Keith with you!? Where have you two been! I've been worried sick.\nMaya:\n... N-Nick... you handle this.\nPhoenix:\nUh, I think I'll leave this one up to you, Maya.\nUncle:\nMeg!\nMaya:\nY-yes!?\nUncle:\nFinally made up your mind, have you?\nMeg:\nM-my mind?\nUncle:\nYou'll run the pasta shop when I'm gone?\nMaya:\nP-pasta?\nUncle:\nGlad to hear it, glad to hear it! You make your old man proud. When you kids left the house, I didn't know what to think. How'm I supposed to keep this place running, an old man like me? Polly! The kids are home!\nParrot:\n\"Hello! Hello!\" *squawk*\nMaya:\nN-Nick! What was that!?\nPhoenix:\nA parrot... the one on the perch.\nUncle:\nKeith!\nPhoenix:\nY-yes!?\nUncle:\nI leave the \"Wet Noodle\" in your capable hands, sonny.\nMaya:\nN-Nick? What's the \"Wet Noodle\"?\nPhoenix:\nUm, based on the available evidence, I'd say it's the name of his pasta shop.\nUncle:\nThat's a relief, isn't it, Polly?\nParrot:\n\"Hello! Hello!\" *squawk*\nUncle:\nAyup... ... *Zzzzz*\nMaya:\nHe fell asleep...\nPhoenix:\nI guess he's relieved.\nAfter clearing \"Polly\" and \"What you saw\" Talk options:\nUncle:\nYou know what? Eh? Little Terry was just here.\nPhoenix:\n\"Terry\"...?\nUncle:\nAyup, that kid next door. You always used to make him cry, remember? He was wearin' this tattered old coat. Got himself some whiskers growing out of his face.\nPhoenix:\n(He must be talking about Detective Gumshoe...)\nUncle:\nHe comes up and tells me to come down to court tomorrow.\nMaya:\nReally...?\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow I don't think we're going to get much useful information out of this guy.) Maya... maybe we should be leaving.\nMaya:\nI think you're right. Oh, wait--I had one more question.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMaya:\nPolly! Polly! Have we forgotten something?\nParrot:\n*squawk* \"Don't forget DL-6!\" *squawk*\nMaya:\nH-huh!? What did she just say, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nOne more time, Polly!\nParrot:\n\"Don't forget DL-6!\" *squawk*\nPhoenix:\n(What!? The DL-6 Incident?) Hey, mister! I-I mean, Dad!\nUncle:\n*Zzzzz*\nPhoenix:\n(This is getting weird... Who IS this old guy!?)\nBoat Rental Shop\nMaya:\nWhy would that bird Polly know about DL-6...?\nPhoenix:\nWe have to figure out who that old man is.\nMaya:\nOh...\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nMaya:\nHe locked the door, from the other side.\nPhoenix:\n(... Who could that old man be...? I think I need to do a little more research on this DL-6 Incident... Maybe I should ask Detective Gumshoe.)\nAfter clearing \"Polly\" and \"What you saw\" Talk options in Caretaker's Shack:\nDecember 26Police DepartmentCriminal Affairs\nGumshoe:\nHey, pal! Long time no see! ... You don't look so happy. What's wrong this time?\nPhoenix:\nActually, we wanted to ask you something...\nGumshoe:\nYeah?\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Parrot:\nGumshoe:\n... I get ya. Sounds like you need information on the DL-6 Incident. Through there is the Station's Records Room. I'll give you special permission to go in and find what you need.\nMaya:\nAll right! Way to go, Detective Gumshoe! Okay, Nick! To the Records Room!\nPhoenix:\n(I guess it's time we faced Edgeworth's past...)\nDecember 26Police DepartmentRecords Room\nMaya:\nWow!!! It's amazing.........ly dusty.\nPhoenix:\nTen years of files and ten years of dust, I guess.\nMaya:\nLet's find that DL-6 stuff quick!\nPhoenix:\n(Fifteen years ago... both me and Edgeworth were nine years old. We were almost through with fourth grade when he suddenly transferred. Because of DL-6...?)\nMaya:\nNick! I found out where the file is!\nPhoenix:\nO-oh, thanks!\nMaya:\nJust let me know what you want to know about the DL-6 Incident! I'll go get the right file!\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\nI guess I know generally what happened in DL-6 now. I still don't know what sort of impact the whole thing had on Edgeworth...\nMaya:\nNick. Are we going to take the whole file? There's too much! We'll never get it out.\nPhoenix:\nY-you're right. How about we just take what we think we'll need...\nDL-6 Case File added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nRight. That's probably all we'll be able to find here. Now, all that's left is the trial tomorrow... I wonder how \"Dad\" will do testifying in court...\nTo be continued."

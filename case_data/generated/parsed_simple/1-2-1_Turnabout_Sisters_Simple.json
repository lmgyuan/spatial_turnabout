You haven't called in a while.\nMia:\nSorry, I've been so busy. How you been?\n???:\nWell, LONELY. And it's all YOUR fault. Nah, I'm just teasing. I've been great! I'm finally getting used to having my own place.\nMia:\nThat's good to hear. Actually, I'm calling because I have a favor to ask.\n???:\nI know, I know. You want me to hold evidence for you?\nMia:\nSharp as always! There's a lot of buzz about the upcoming trial... I just don't feel safe keeping the evidence here.\n???:\nI gotcha. So, what is it this time?\nMia:\nIt's... a clock.\n???:\nA clock?\nMia:\nYeah, it's made to look like that statue, \"The Thinker.\" And it tells you the time! I thought you might like it. You always liked toys.\n???:\nHey! I'm not a little girl anymore, Sis!\nMia:\nNow, now. You know I'm only teasing. Ah, I should probably tell you, the clock isn't talking right now.\n???:\nHuh? It's not working? That's lame!\nMia:\nI had to take the clockwork out. Sorry. I put some papers inside it instead.\n???:\nPapers? Is that the evidence, then? Hmm, well... there's a possibility that it might turn out that way, yes.\nMia:\nCan you come by the office tonight, say 9:00, to pick it up? I'll be in a pretrial meeting until then.\n???:\nOkay, Sis, but I expect dinner! Something good! Like... burgers! I could really go for a good burger.\nMia:\nOkay, okay. We'll hit the usual joint.\n???:\nAlright! It's a deal! Okay, Sis, see you soon!\nMia:\nYep. I'll be waiting, Maya.\nCellular:\n*beep*\n[Conversation recorded. September 5, 9:27 AM]\nSeptember 5, 8:57 PMFey & Co. Law Offices\n???:\nNow, Miss Fey, I'll take what's mine... the papers.\nMia:\nI'm sorry, but I can't give you what I don't have.\n???:\nMiss Fey, you are a poor liar. Why, I see it right over there... That must be \"The Thinker\" that swallowed those papers.\nMia:\nHow could you know...?\n???:\nHo hoh. You are not cogniferous of my background? Gathering information is my business, you see.\nMia:\nI... I should have been more careful.\n???:\nHo hoh. My dear Miss Fey... I am so very sorry. But I am afraid I must ask you for one more thing. Your eternal silence... Farewell, Miss Fey.\nMia:\n!!!\nRed... White... Blue...\nEpisode 2Turnabout Sisters\nSeptember 5, 9:08 PMFey & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nUh oh, I'm late. Huh, that's strange. The chief must have gone home already. She said her sister was coming over so we should all go out for dinner... ... What's that smell...? Blood...? Mia! (Maybe she's in her office!)\nPhoenix:\nThat smell... Blood!\n???:\n... *sob* Sis...\nPhoenix:\n(Someone's there!) ...! Chief? Chief...?\nChief!!!\nPhoenix:\nWho are you?\n???:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(The strange girl dropped out cold. I left her lying on the office sofa. I went back to the chief where she lay under the window. Her body was still warm... I could feel it when I held her shoulder. Then, all too quickly, it began to fade... Until finally she was cold.)\nPhoenix:\nChief...\nFey & Co. Law Offices\nAfter examining corded phone in Office and presenting Receipt in Fey & Co. Law Offices:\n*whee-ooo* *whee-ooo*... *whee-ooo* *whee-ooo*...\nPhoenix:\n! The police! (Sounds like they're coming this way!)\nFreeze! Police!\nGumshoe:\nAlright, I'm Detective Dick Gumshoe, see?\nPhoenix:\n(Gumshoe...? What an odd name.)\nGumshoe:\nWe received a report from the building across the way, see. Got a person saying they saw a murder.\nPhoenix:\n(It must have been that woman I saw.)\nGumshoe:\nAnyway, I don't want either of you moving one inch, 'kay?\nPhoenix:\n(Great. Just great. Maya... Wait, she wouldn't have... nah.)\nGumshoe:\nWhoaaaaaaaaaaaah! Scuze me!\nMaya:\nEek!\nGumshoe:\nThis word \"Maya\" here mean anything to you?\nMaya:\n...! Um... that... That's my name...\nGumshoe:\nWHAAAAT!? The victim drew this here note in her own blood, see? With her dying breath, she wrote down the killer's name!\nMaya:\nK-killer...? I'm not--\nGumshoe:\nCase closed! You're coming down to the precinct, ma'am.\nMaya:\nW-what?\nPhoenix:\nMia's younger sister, Maya, was arrested on the spot. I was taken in for questioning and didn't get out until the next morning. My eyes were heavy... but I couldn't sleep. I sat around, waiting for visiting hours to begin at the detention center. I had to talk to Maya as soon as possible.\nSeptember 6, 9:07 AMDetention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\n(Wow, they have poor Maya locked up like a criminal.)\nMaya:\nOh! It's you! The lawyer... G-good morning.\nPhoenix:\nGood morning! (She looks so tired...)\nMaya:\nUm... Are you going to be my attorney?\nPhoenix:\nWell, that's what I wanted to talk to you about...\nPhoenix:\n(Did I look at her like that?) No, no! I never thought...\nMaya:\nI-it's okay. I understand. ... And... I've also heard about you.\nPhoenix:\nHeard...? Heard what about me?\nMaya:\nI... was talking to my sister on the phone the other day...\nMia:\n\"Today was my junior partner's first time in court.\"\nMaya:\nWow! Really? How'd that go?\nMia:\n\"It was quite the scene! Honestly, I was on edge the whole time. It's been a while...\"\nMaya:\nHah! So, he crashed and burned?\nMia:\n\"...He's a genius. One of those 'strike fear into the hearts of evil' types... The only thing he's lacking is... experience.\"\nMaya:\nHuh, sounds like it was fun! Well, I know who to go to if I ever get into trouble now!\nMia:\n\"I don't know, Maya. I think you might want to wait... give him three more years. That is, unless you want to be found guilty.\"\nMaya:\nThat's what she said!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nI-I'm sorry! I didn't mean to trouble you...\nPhoenix:\nNo, it's okay. It's true, I guess. But... at the same time, I can't just sit and watch! When I think of the person who did this to Mia...\nMaya:\n... I know...\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nMaya:\n... Um...!\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Something the matter?\nMaya:\nUm... I was wondering, could I ask you a favor?\nPhoenix:\n...?\nMaya:\nThis is the address of a famous lawyer. My sister gave me this a long time ago. She said if I was ever in trouble, I should call him. And, well, I'm in trouble. Do you think you could go ask him to represent me?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm...)\nMaya:\nThey told me that if I don't find one, the state will pick an attorney to defend me.\nPhoenix:\nWhen will that happen?\nMaya:\nThey're giving me until 4:00 this afternoon.\nPhoenix:\n(And visiting hours are almost up... I'd better hurry!) Right, I'll be back!\nSeptember 6Fey & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\n(The office is filled with police officers. They're all busily searching for clues...)\n???:\nHey! You there! This is a crime scene, pal! No trespassing! Umm... Sorry, don't I know you from somewhere? Wait, you're that Butz guy, aren't you!\nPhoenix:\nNo, no, Phoenix Wright. (How could anyone mistake me for Larry!?)\n???:\nAh, guess I got the wrong name, Mr. Wright. Sorry 'bout that. That Butz guy, he was a killer! And you're no killer! Right?\nPhoenix:\n(He WAS proven innocent...) Umm... right. And you were...\nGumshoe:\nAnyway, get the name right. And don't go calling me \"Dick\"...\nPolice:\nHey, Dick! Get over here!\nGumshoe:\nY-yes, sir! B-be right there! Umm... ahem! You're her lawyer, right, pal? If you got business here, you'd better do it quick!\nPhoenix:\n(Whew! He thinks I'm Maya's lawyer...!)\nAfter clearing \"Mia\" and \"Maya\" Talk options and presenting Maya's Memo:\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I've asked all the questions I need to.)\nGumshoe:\nYou all done, pal?\nPhoenix:\nUm, yes, thank you. I'll be heading out now.\nGumshoe:\nOh, wait. One more thing I wanted to mention to you. I don't suppose you're planning on talking to that witness. Anyway, you'd better not! No influencing the witness with your lawyerly ways, pal!\nPhoenix:\n... (Come to think of it, I had completely forgotten about her...) The... witness?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, Miss April May. I'm sorry 'bout this... But I can't tell you anything about her!\nPhoenix:\n(Well, you just told me her name. Miss May, huh?) So you've sent her home already, then?\nGumshoe:\nAhah! You're trying your lawyerly tricks on me now! She's not to go outside her room until the trial!\nPhoenix:\n(So... she's still in the hotel across the way.) I guess I should know better than to try to get a detective to leak information.\nGumshoe:\nYou got that right, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(Time to pay a visit to Miss May!)\nSeptember 6Grossberg Law Offices\nPhoenix:\n(According to the receptionist, the big boss is \"out\". She couldn't say when he'd be back. It must be hard to keep track of everything when you're a famous lawyer... Not to mention run an office like this. I guess I'll just have to come back later.)\nDetention Center (after visitng Grossberg Law Offices, but before examining open drawer in Gatewater Hotel - Room 303)\nMaya:\nHey! What is it? Did you meet the lawyer?\nPhoenix:\nSorry. I haven't seen him yet.\nMaya:\nI see...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm. I'd better go see if I can find this elite lawyer she's talking about.)\nSeptember 6Gatewater Hotel - Room 303\nApril:\nWell! Hello there, handsome.\nPhoenix:\nUmm... hi. (Smooth, Wright, real smooth.)\nApril:\nYou're the lawyer, aren't you? The detective told me... He said, \"Don't say nothing to that lawyer, pal!\" Tee hee!\nPhoenix:\n(Memo to self: thank Detective Gumshoe for making my job harder.)\nApril:\nGee! This is all like something out of a movie! It's all so exciting I can hardly contain myself! Ooh! Let me go freshen up so I can look the part of the beautiful eyewitness!\nPhoenix:\n(I pity the lawyer that has to cross-examine this one.)\nPhoenix:\n(There's a screwdriver stuck in this drawer. I wonder what's inside? Let's take a look...)\nApril:\nHey! H-h-hey!!! What are you doing!? No touching! Oooh. Bad boy! Y-you really shouldn't pry around in other people's rooms, now. You wouldn't want to make me upset, would you?\nPhoenix:\n(Upset!? I thought she was going to explode for a second there! I wonder what could be inside the drawer?)\nGrossberg Law Offices (after examining open drawer in Gatewater Hotel - Room 303)\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... seems like Mr. Grossberg is out. Well, maybe I should just wait here for him to come back.)\n???:\n*Ah-HHHHEM!*\nPhoenix:\n(If that wasn't the most over-the-top clearing of the throat I've ever heard!)\nGrossberg:\nAh hah! So, you're the one they say has been looking for me?\nPhoenix:\nUh... y-yes, that's me! (He looks even... grander than I imagined!)\nGrossberg:\nHmm...? That badge on your collar...? Ah, so you're a lawyer, are you now?\nPhoenix:\nY-yes, well... yes.\nGrossberg:\nAnd what do you want? I'm not particularly busy these days... Please, proceed!\nPhoenix:\n(Not busy...? Then how come no one could get in touch with you?)\nGrossberg:\nHmm? Something the matter? You came to see the one-and-only Marvin Grossberg, did you not? Well, here I am, boy! What do you want? Out with it!\nPhoenix:\nUm... w-well, sir, actually it's about Maya. Maya Fey.\nGrossberg:\n...! Ah... yes. Maya Fey. Go on.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm? Why the strange reaction?)\nGrossberg:\nA-cha-cha. I'm really quite busy here, son. I can't go taking cases on a day's notice! No, it's quite impossible.\nPhoenix:\nW-wait a second! How did you know the trial was tomorrow!?\nGrossberg:\nUrk? Ahem! A-anyway... I'm afraid it's entirely impossible for me to represent her. Sorry. End of discussion.\nPhoenix:\n(What's going on!? He refused me before I even got a chance to ask him! What do I tell Maya...?)\nFey & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\n... (Looks like Detective Gumshoe has gone home. The police are still keeping themselves busy in the chief's office. No one has time to talk to me. Guess I'll head out.)\nDetention Center (after examining open drawer in Gatewater Hotel - Room 303, then visitng Grossberg Law Offices)\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Maya's not here. She must be in questioning. They probably won't let her out for a while. Maybe I'd better go talk to that lawyer again.\nAfter clearing all Talk options in Grossberg Law Offices:\nSeptember 6, 3:42 PMDetention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\nHiya.\nMaya:\nOh! You're back! Did you find the lawyer?\nPhoenix:\nUm... well... (What do I tell her?) Well, see... (Just be honest!) I... I really don't think you should use that guy. He... didn't seem healthy. He was all skin and bones!\nMaya:\n... What really happened?\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nYou don't mean... He refused to help?\nPhoenix:\nUrp.\nMaya:\n... I see. I've been abandoned, then.\nMaya:\nJust a little longer now before the state-appointed lawyer comes, I guess...\nPhoenix:\n... (4:00 PM. Time's up. What should I do? Do I just leave her and go home...?)\nPhoenix:\nI've made up my mind! I'm going to defend you whether you want me to or not!\nMaya:\n! Why?\nPhoenix:\nWhy? Well...\nPhoenix:\nI won't abandon you. You can count on me.\nMaya:\n... That's so kind of you... *sniff*... ...\nPhoenix:\nWell! Let's fight this one and get you out of here!\nMaya:\nR-right! Thank you!\nPhoenix:\n(Whew, she smiled at last. She looks like an entirely different person!) One last question... You are innocent, right?\nMaya:\nYes! And I trust you... So you trust me, too, okay?\nPhoenix:\nIt's a deal. (So, what next... There's something that's been bugging me... Just what was inside that strange woman's drawer? It was when I tried to look into the drawer that she got all defensive. There has to be something in there!)\nGatewater Hotel\nBellboy:\nGood afternoon, sir!\nPhoenix:\nExcuse me, you are...?\nBellboy:\nAh, I beg your pardon, sir! I am the bellboy of this establishment, at your service, sir.\nPhoenix:\nOh, right.\nBellboy:\nI've just come up to deliver room service, sir.\nPhoenix:\nUm... do you know where Miss May might be?\nBellboy:\nAh. I believe our guest Miss May is currently using the, er, facilities...? If you've no need of anything, I'll be taking my leave. Please, stay as long as you like. Enjoy...\nPhoenix:\nYeah... Wait... no! Hey! ... (Why does it seem like every time I come here, I end up embarrassing myself? Wait... now's my chance to snoop around a bit!)\nBellboy:\nAh, I almost forgot!\nPhoenix:\nGah! Y-you came back quick!\nBellboy:\nMight I ask you to inform Miss May that there is a message for her? Please tell her that Mr. White, of Bluecorp phoned.\nPhoenix:\nOh, right. Sure. (Mr. White... of Bluecorp? Where have I heard that name?)\nMaya:\nWhite... That was his name. My sister told me.\nPhoenix:\n(\"White\" was the name of the guy who ruined Mia and Maya's mother! Could it be a coincidence?)\nPhoenix:\nThere's a screwdriver sticking out of that half-open drawer. Now's my chance to see what's inside! ...! What do we have here! A... wiretap? Hmm! What would a woman like her be doing with a thing like this?\nWiretap added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nThere is definitely something suspicious about this \"Miss May\"! Why would she have something like this in her hotel room? There's a story behind all this, I know it! Alright... I'll be using this bit of evidence in tomorrow's trial, that's for sure. For Maya's sake... I'll get to this woman's bottom! Wait... I mean ... you know what I mean.\nApril:\nOh, bellboy...? Still there?\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh, time to scram! I look forward to tangoing with you tomorrow, Miss May! In court!)\nTo be continued."

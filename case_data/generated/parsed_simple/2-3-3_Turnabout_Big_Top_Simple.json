What is it, Pearls?\nPearl:\nDoes magic have anything to do with channeling spirits?\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think it has anything to do with channeling...) You don't know about magic, do you Pearls?\nPearl:\nI'm sorry...\nPhoenix:\n(I braved the winter cold and took Pearls to see the circus. It's been six months since the incident in Kurain Village... and it was during that trying time that I met Pearls... (Changed from [It was during that terrible time that I met Pearls...] in the original release) Thankfully, she seems to be recovering from it, and is returning to her normal self. (Changed from [It seems like she is starting to get back to normal...] in the original release))\nMaya:\nAhh... It's time to go.\nPearl:\nYou're right. We can't miss the last train.\nPhoenix:\nPearls! You remembered the train!\nPearl:\nOf course I did! But I don't really understand what everyone means by \"express train\".\nMaya:\nWell, Nick...

You have to turn on the TV!\nPhoenix:\n(The TV?)\nTV:\n...Now let's check in at the scene!\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? What happened...?)\nTV:\n...Thank you. We're here at the Berry Big Circus.

They arrested him too!\nPhoenix:\nA-Arrested who?\nMaya:\nMax! They arrested Max Galactica!!\nPhoenix:\n(Maximillion Galactica. Fans call him Max. A popular magician who can fly through the sky at will... Maya said she was a huge fan of Max...)\nMaya:\nAlright Nick! I'll see you in two hours at the Detention Center.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?

You've still got plenty of time to clean up your office later!\nPhoenix:\nW-WWWHHHAATTT!?\nPhone:\n...*beep*...\nDecember 28, 11:19 AMDetention CenterVisitor's Room\nMaya:\nWhat are they talking about? Why did they arrest Max?\nPhoenix:\nYou're asking the wrong man on that one, Maya. Maybe he used his magical skills to deal death with a slight [sic] of hand...\nMaya:\nMaximillion Galactica would never do such a thing!!\n???:\nFABULOUS!! What the young lady just said was absolutely fabulous! What a clever girl! Such a fabulous understanding of events!\nPhoenix:\n(...What's with all this fabulous talk...)\nMax:\nWelcome to the Visitor's Room!\nMaya:\nIt's MAX!! Nick!! Look!

I want this one.\nMax:\nSo sweetie, let's be honest here... You came to this visitor's room to visit me, didn't you?\nMaya:\nY-Yes! I'm your biggest fan!!\nMax:\nFabulous! Absolutely fabulous! Thank you so much!!\nPhoenix:\nHey... Umm... What about my card?\nMax:\nThink of it as a souvenir.\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nWell Nick... I think it's time to get to work.\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nWhat's the matter, Nick? Why are you looking at the ceiling?\nPhoenix:\nI was just thinking about what I should have for lunch.\nMax:\nSweetie... Drop porcupine head over there. Shower me with your attention. OK?\nMaya:\nO-O-O-Oh, yes...! (Changed from [Y-Y-Y-Yes...] in the original release)\nMax:\nAb-so-lute-ly... FABULOUS!!\nPhoenix:\n(Absolutely cringe inducing.)\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Attorney's Badge:\nMax:\n... Anyways... I've been curious about something for a while now.\nMaya:\nWhat's that?\nMax:\nWhy do you keep looking at me with such a sad look on your face, sweetie?\nMaya:\nBe-Because! You've been arrested! For murder!\nMax:\nOh, don't be ignorant. They wouldn't arrest someone like me!!\nPhoenix:\nWhy is that?\nMax:\nObviously because I'm the fabulous Maximillion Galactica!\nPhoenix:\nSo?\nMax:\nI'm the very big star of the Berry Big Circus.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that means?\nMax:\nI'm rich. I'm paid fabulous sums!\nPhoenix:\nWhich means what?\nMax:\n...\nMaya:\nMax...\nMax:\nQuit joking around! You've got to be pulling my magic wand! The police aren't really serious about all this, are they?\nPhoenix:\nThey don't arrest people as a joke.\nMax:\n...!!\nMaya:\nLook at Max... He's crushed...\nPhoenix:\nWell he needed to wake up and smell the coffee. (This is serious business.)\nMax:\nUmm... Umm...\nPhoenix:\nYes?\nMax:\nPorcu... I mean, Sir. You're a lawyer, right?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Oh, yeah. I'm an attorney.\nMax:\nPlease! Help me! I didn't kill nobody!\nMaya:\n\"Didn't kill nobody!?\"\nMax:\nI may be more spoiled than a hog in a hamburger mud pit... But a killer!? That's insane... I... I... I could never...\nMaya:\nM-Max?\nMax:\nI swear!! I just wanted to pay off my daddy's debt... He's back on the farm...\nPhoenix:\nOK... OK... I'll take your case.\nMax:\nR-Really?\nPhoenix:\nReally.\nMax:\nUh... Thank ya much. Ya'll sure are nice folks.\nMaya:\nUmm... Max.\nMax:\nYes?\nMaya:\nWhat's your real name?\nMax:\nIt's Billy Bob Johns...\nMaya:\n............ (Changed from [... Ugh...] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nWhat's the matter, Maya?\nMaya:\nHe's really just a country bumpkin!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMax:\n...Ahem. I must apologize for not being my absolutely fabulous self just now, sweetie.\nMaya:\nH-Huh?\nMax:\nMr. Attorney.\nPhoenix:\nYes?\nMax:\nA few minutes ago, you took one of my cards, didn't you?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Now that he mentions it... I did take a card.)\nMax:\nIt was the 10 of Hearts. Right?\nPhoenix:\n(Wha... How'd he... He got it right, again!)\nMax:\nWhat can I say? You, too... You've stolen some of my most valued possessions. Ten of Maximillion Galactica's hearts...\nPhoenix:\n(You sure do have a lot of hearts, don't you?)\nMax:\nAh ha ha ha... I'm putting my faith in you sweetie.\nPhoenix:\n(He didn't just call me sweetie, did he?)\nMaya:\nAlright! Let's make this an absolutely fabulous case! C'mon, Nick!\nDecember 28Wright & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nAlright... We've got lots of things we have to look into. No time for slacking. Let's get going.\nMaya:\nOK.\nPhoenix:\n? What's the matter? You seem down.\nMaya:\nMaximilion Galactica... Who would have guessed he was country bumpkin?\nDecember 28Berry Big CircusCircus Entrance\nMaya:\nWe're here again...\nPhoenix:\nYep. But this time we are here for work. (It hasn't been that long since the crime, so the police are still on the scene.)\nMaya:\nLet's find someone who might know something about what happened.\nPhoenix:\nSounds like a plan.\nDecember 28Lodging HousePlaza\nPhoenix:\nThis seems to be a dorm where all the performers in the circus stay...\nMaya:\nReally!? So we might run into that stoogey clown here, right? He's so kooky! (Changed from [Really!? So that stoogey clown should be here, huh? He's so kooky!] in the original release)\n???:\nAhhh! It's you two!\nMaya:\nOh... Detective Gumshoe!\nGumshoe:\nHow is it you guys always seem to know when I'm working a crime scene, pal? (Changed from [I always see you hanging around when I'm working a crime scene, pal.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nBecause you're always working, Detective. (Changed from [You always seem to be working so hard, Detective.] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nWell, I'd rather not be always working, but with crime, you don't make your own hours. (Changed from [I'd rather not be working hard, but with crime you don't make your own hours.] in the original release) If I have to be at the circus anyway, I want to see the lion tamer and the tightrope. However, no matter where I go, the show is always the same... Dead body. Stage left.\nMaya:\nNick! Nick! He complained!!\nPhoenix:\nHeh heh... That's a rarity. Let's get back to business now, OK?\nAfter clearing \"The eyewitness\" Talk option in Lodging House - Plaza:\nDecember 28Lodging Hall 1st FloorMoe's Room\nPhoenix:\nI wonder whose room this is. (Changed from [This is it?] in the original release)\nMaya:\nThe nametag on the door says \"Moe\" on it.\nPhoenix:\nI guess he's not here...\nMaya:\nWow... It's a real mess in here!\nPhoenix:\n(My room's probably worse though...)\nMaya:\nOh well... I give up. We'll have to come back later.\nDecember 28Berry Big CircusBig Top\nPhoenix:\nThe circus stage sure doesn't look this small from out in the audience...\nMaya:\nWow... This is where they all perform, isn't it? Nick! Do some somersaults!\nPhoenix:\nI'm not doing any somersaults.\nMaya:\nWhy not!? You look like you'd be great at it!\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I look like I'd be great at somersaults!?)\n???:\nGrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...\nMaya:\nHuh? Nick?\nPhoenix:\nIt wasn't me.\n???:\nGrrrrrrrrrrr... Grawwwwwww!!\nMaya:\nT-T-T-T-T-T-T... TIGER!!\nPhoenix:\nH-H-H-He's c-c-coming this way!!\n???:\nGrrrrrrrrr... Grawwwwwww!!\nPhoenix:\nAHHHHHHHHHHH!!\nMaya:\nNick! You're too young to die! NICK!!\n???:\nSTAY! STAY! HEEL!\n???:\nGrrrrrrrrr...\nPhoenix:\n(I'm still here... I'm not dead, yet!!)\nMaya:\nN-Nick! Nick! Are you OK?\n???:\nAhahaha! Scared ya didn't I? Regent is such a cute tiger! Isn't he!?\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\n...\n???:\nWhat's the matter? You two sure are quiet.\nMaya:\nDon't \"What's the matter?\" me! N-Nick... He almost died there!!\n???:\nHah! He wasn't anywhere close to getting hurt, let alone dying! This little tiger hardly ever bites people. And besides, people normally never get to play with a wild tiger, right? So if you think about it, you're actually really lucky!\nPhoenix:\nHuh!?\n???:\nYou agree, don't you?\nPhoenix:\n... I guess...\nMaya:\nW-W-W-What do you mean you guess!? Why are you agreeing with her?\n???:\nWoohoo!! Your costume...\nMaya:\nEh?\n???:\nIt's cute. I wanna try it on!!\nMaya:\nC-Costume? You mean my clothes...?\n???:\nYou don't mind letting me try it on, right?\nMaya:\nUhh... I guess not...\n???:\nREALLY!? Hehehehehe!! You're the best!\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... The tables turned quickly on that one. So much for the tiger thing...)\n???:\nOh! I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Regina Berry... The renowned animal tamer of the Berry Big Circus!\nMaya:\nMy name's Maya Fey. I'm a spirit medium.\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix Wright. Attorney at law. (When you put us up next to an animal tamer, I bet we really look odd!)\nRegina:\nNice to meet ya!\nPhoenix:\nUhh... Likewise...\nDetention Center\nAfter clearing \"Something unusual\" and \"The eyewitness\" Talk options in Lodging House - Plaza, and visiting Big Top:\nDecember 28Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nMaya:\n... Max isn't here.\nPhoenix:\nHe must be in questioning.\nMaya:\nAww... I wanted to see a magic trick.\nPhoenix:\nHe should be back in a little bit.\nMaya:\nI guess so.\nLodging House - Plaza\nWright & Co. Law Offices\nAfter presenting Russell Berry profile in Berry Big Circus - Big Top:\nDecember 28Big TopRingmaster's Room\nMaya:\nThis was the Ringmaster's room?\nPhoenix:\nYes. This room belonged to the victim. Which means this must be where Max met the Ringmaster last night.\nMaya:\nNow that you mention it, that is what he said.\nPhoenix:\nI wonder what... Hmm... That's an interesting poster. (Changed from [I wonder what... Hmm... That's an intresting [sic] poster.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nAh! It's a poster of Max! I want it! I want it! Nick!

Ha... Huh? M-Me?\nPhoenix:\nYes. You work at the circus don't you?\n???:\nN-No. I'm just your everyday average Joe.\nMaya:\nAn average Joe who just happens to hang out at the circus? I don't think so.\n???:\nY-Yes I am. I've got nothing to do with what's going on here.\nPhoenix:\n(He's lying. Like any regular person would hang around the circus... Dressed like that!) I'm an attorney. My name is Phoenix Wright.\nMaya:\nI'm a spirit medium. My name is Maya.\n???:\nWell... I... Um... Just happened to be... Umm... Passing by...\nPhoenix:\nI don't suppose you happen to be some kind of carny?\n???:\nNot a c-c-carny... I-I'm a p-performer. Actually, I'm a v-v-v-ventriloquist.\nMaya:\nVentriloquist?\n???:\nHe-he-he-he-he-he-he... I-I-I'm Benjamin Wo-Wo-Wo-Woodman...\nMaya:\nYour last name is Woodman? *snicker* (Changed from [You're [sic] last name is Woodman? *snicker*] in the original release)\n???:\nY-Yes... T-T-That's right... But e-everyone c-c-calls me B-B-B-B-B-Ben.\nMaya:\nAh... Yes yes yes... That's your alias, right?\nPhoenix:\nI believe they call it a stage name.\nBig Top\nWright & Co.

Aha!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMoe:\nI welched on giving you more than one!!\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nMoe:\nNo no no! If it was funny, it is your duty as a human being to laugh!! People who don't laugh are usually last-seen in Lan-sing. Catch my drift? Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Maya?\nMaya:\nAha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nPhoenix:\n(This is like some Faustian nightmare...)\nMaya:\nC'mon! It was funny! Clowns are always funny in my book!\nPhoenix:\nIn my book, they're just funny lookin'.\nMoe:\nYou sure do have a great taste in clothes girlie! Look at that garb! You look just like Gretta Garb... OH! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nPhoenix:\n*sigh* I'm goin' home...\nMaya:\nNo! Nick! You can't!!\nPhoenix:\nYou know, I can excuse a bad joke or two... But this stooge keeps laughing at his own jokes! That's what I object to!\nMaya:\nOK OK... I get it. But you have to admit he is kinda funny...\nPhoenix:\n(Argghhh... No, I do not have to admit that, because he isn't!)\nMoe:\nAha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nWright & Co. Law Offices\nBig Top\nAfter presenting Max profile in Lodging Hall 1st Floor - Moe's Room:\nDecember 28Big TopCafeteria\nMaya:\nEww... This place is gross.\nPhoenix:\nThis must be because of last night. They didn't have time to clean up after dinner because of the murder.\nMaya:\nThat reminds me... What was it that Moe said?\nPhoenix:\nHe said that yesterday morning Max \"clonked\" Ben over the head here.\nMaya:\nHe also said that, \"There's Gotti be something interesting there.\" Nick? What's \"Gotti be interesting?\"\nPhoenix:\nDon't ask...\nMaya:\nHmph!\nAfter examining posters and table in Big Top - Ringmaster's Room and clearing all Talk options in Lodging Hall 1st Floor - Moe's Room:\nDecember 28Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nMax:\nOh!

Ben's not here anymore!\nPhoenix:\nYeah... I wanted to ask him something.\nMaya:\nIt's cold out... He's probably in the tent.\nDecember 28Berry Big CircusBig Top\nMaya:\nWhat do you think, Nick? I wonder if we've been making any progress...\nPhoenix:\nDon't be so negative... Of course we are making progress.\nMaya:\nBut... Everyone loved the Ringmaster... And there's no sign of footprints on the scene... There's still a lot of mysteries left to be solved.\nPhoenix:\nOf course.\nMaya:\nAnd now Regina isn't here!\nPhoenix:\nI'm not seeing how that's related...\nDecember 28Big TopRingmaster's Room\nMaya:\nIt looks the same as always... A great big mess. Considering how messy it is, I bet they wouldn't notice if another poster went missing.\nPhoenix:\nWill you just stop it, you poster pilferer!\nMaya:\nI'm just kidding! You know I already got one of these posters!!\nPhoenix:\nYou mean \"stole\" one of those posters!\nMaya:\nYeah... Uh... Let's focus on what Max told us.

Now try speaking to me again, but this time with some proper respect!\nPhoenix:\n(Not again... *sigh*) Mr. Quist... Is that better?\nTrilo:\nNo! Look at me when I am talking to you, you 8-bit excuse for an attorney!\nBen:\nTrilo! We talked about insulting people! You promised!!\nTrilo:\nBut he was mocking me!

Being mean to bullies was not included in the deal!] in the original release)\nBen:\nI'm sorry, Trilo...\nMaya:\nNick! What just happened? Trilo is still a puppet right? A ventriloquist's puppet!\nTrilo:\nHey! Who do you think you are, calling me a puppet!?\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nBen:\nUmm... Uhh... Thanks...

Money?\nAfter presenting Trilo Quist, then clearing all Talk options in Big Top - Cafeteria:\nDecember 28Lodging HousePlaza\nMaya:\nHuh? Detective Gumshoe took off already.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... Probably because we ditched him earlier. (Changed from [Yep. Just leave him alone for a while, OK Maya?] in the original release) I bet he and the other cops got lonely and headed back to the precinct. (Changed from [I'm sure he just got lonely and headed back to the precinct.] in the original release)\nDecember 28Lodging Hall 1st FloorMoe's Room\nMoe:\nOh my! If it isn't \"Mr. Wright All The Time\"!!\nPhoenix:\n*ugh*\nMoe:\nIt's all Wright to be wrong every now and again, Wright?\nMaya:\nSee Nick! It just took awhile for the joke to find its audience!\nPhoenix:\n... *sigh*\nMoe:\nSo what can I do for you? Did you remember a good joke you wanted to tell me? Pull up a chair, or maybe just pull my finger, and let me have it.\nMaya:\nWe're going to get the same sound effect either way, aren't we?\nMoe:\nHow'd you know I put a whopee [sic] cushion on the chair!? You really know what it takes to be a clown, don't you? Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!

It seems like he's not around today...\nMaya:\nEh... That's a big pile of junk over in the corner...\nMoe:\nI don't think it'd be wrong to assume that Phoenix's stuff is over there too... Just be careful to make sure you've got the Wright stuff.\nMaya:\nThanks Moe! See you later!\nMoney has been added to the Court Record.\nAcro's Room\nMaya:\nHoly cow! There's a fork...

Check this out.\nMaya:\nIt's a ring...\nPhoenix:\nThere's something engraved on it... \"From T to R\"...\nRing put in pocket.\nPhoenix:\nWell... I think it's about time we wrap up our investigation...\nMaya:\nDo you think we'll win in court tomorrow?\nPhoenix:\nWho knows... Even I can't imagine what kind of testimony will come out tomorrow. (I'm guessing Moe will be a witness in court tomorrow... Moe and maybe the puppet.)\nMaya:\nDon't worry Nick. No matter what, we've still got a magician on our side!!\nPhoenix:\nThat's good, because we might need some magic tomorrow...\nTo be continued.\nMoe's Room (before examining junk pile in Lodging Hall 3rd Floor - Acro's Room)\nMaya:\nHuh? Moe must have gone off somewhere...\nPhoenix:\nJust as long as he isn't off writing new jokes...\nMaya:\nOh, that reminds me Nick... You have to get your Attorney's Badge back by tomorrow, or we're in trouble.\nPhoenix:\nI know. I know. (I'm gonna have to try and find out where that monkey hid it...)\n\nDecember 29, 9:43 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 5\nMax:\n...\nPhoenix:\nGood morning Max.\nMax:\n...\nMaya:\nMax?\nMax:\nMil... Milk...\nMaya:\nWhat?\nMax:\nIf I don't have a glass of milk before I go on stage... I just can't function sweetie.\nMaya:\nSt-Stage? Don't worry... There won't be a stage. All you have to do is sit down.\nMax:\nI guess...\nMaya:\nNick. Max is really nervous.\nPhoenix:\nThat's understandable.\nMax:\nHey! My sweeties!!\nPhoenix:\nW-What!?\nMax:\nYou don't think I should fly, do you?\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMax:\nYou know... You've got to make a good first impression! When I enter the room, maybe I should fly in and warm up the crowd a little...\nPhoenix:\nNo no no no no... We can't be having you flying around the courtroom... It just wouldn't be right. Imagine if you hit someone!\nMaya:\nDon't worry Max... Just do what Nick says and everything will be OK.\nMax:\nOh sweetie!!\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it this time, Max?\nMax:\nWhy don't you try flying into the courtroom?\nPhoenix:\n...\nMax:\nI can see it now... The dashing young lawyer flying fabulously in from above! One glimpse of that, and everyone in the room will be on your side!\nMaya:\nMax... Really... No one needs to fly today. ... Nick? What's with that look in your eyes?\nPhoenix:\n(I like the sound of that... \"Dashing young lawyer flying fabulously...\")\nDecember 29, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2\nJudge:\nAnd now the case of one... ............\nPhoenix:\n............\nvon Karma:\n............\nJudge:\n............ What!?\nvon Karma:\nYour Honor! Get on with it!\nJudge:\nOh... Sorry... I just realized that the defendant's name is Billy Bob Johns.\nPhoenix:\nSo...\nJudge:\nWell, isn't the defendant also known as Maximillion Galactica?\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor, he does often go by that name.\nJudge:\nYou know, my grandchild is a huge fan of his. I think everyone here wouldn't mind if we call the defendant Maximillion Galactica... It sounds more... Friendly.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I wonder if that is to our advantage?)\nJudge:\nMs. von Karma. Your opening statement if you please.\nvon Karma:\n...I hope you didn't bother thinking you'd win this one Mr. Phoenix Wright.\nPhoenix:\nEh?\nvon Karma:\nThat spirit channeling trial was a sham! I refuse to acknowledge its legitimacy! It did not count! Do you hear me!?\nPhoenix:\n(She must still be upset about what happened last time...)\nvon Karma:\nYou have no chance. Zero. Zilch. Nada. I'm not losing this case! Why, you ask? Because it is not in the nature of a Von Karma to lose at anything!!\nMaya:\nI guess being born with the name Von Karma is a free pass to be arrogant and annoying.\nvon Karma:\nWatch and learn, Mr. Phoenix Wright! I'll show you the textbook procedure for proving how absolutely guilty you are!!\nPhoenix:\nM-M-M-Me!? ... Guilty!? What are you talking about!?\nvon Karma:\n...It will be my ultimate revenge...\nMaya:\nBut it's not like it'll bring her dad back... (Changed from [Her dad is gone you know...] in the original release)\nvon Karma:\nThere. Opening statement complete. Now, let's hurry and wrap up this waste of time. (Chagned from [The prosecution is finished. Let's hurry and wrap up this waste of time.] in the original release)\nJudge:\nVery well. You may call your first witness Ms. von Karma. (Changed from [You may call your first witness Ms. von Karma.] in the original release)\nvon Karma:\nDetective Dick Gumshoe! Get up there! NOW!!\nvon Karma:\nSorry to keep you from work, as I'm sure you need every penny you can earn, Detective.\nGumshoe:\nDon't mention it! It's no trouble at all! I've been looking forward to this.\nvon Karma:\nVery well. I would like you to begin by shedding light on the events in question.\nGumshoe:\nAt your service, sir.\nJudge:\nAlright, Detective. You may proceed with your testimony.\nWitness Testimony\n-- Details of the Events --\nGumshoe:\nThe night of the crime, snow was falling until 9:40 PM, making it extremely cold out.\nAll of the circus performers gathered in the Big Top to practice their routines.\nThe practice session broke up around 10 PM.\nThe murder itself took place in the plaza in front of the lodging house at 10:15 PM.\nThe victim was found bent over a wooden box dead as a doornail.\nThe cause of death was blunt force trauma that snapped a vertebrae in his neck.\nJudge:\nI see... He was beaten to death.\nGumshoe:\nHere is the autopsy report for the victim.\nJudge:\nThe court accept [sic] this into evidence.\nAutopsy Report added to the Court Record.\nJudge:\nA blunt object... Hmm... Very well... Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.\nCross Examination\n-- Details of the Events --\nGumshoe:\nThe night of the crime, snow was falling until 9:40 PM, making it extremely cold out.\nGumshoe:\nAll of the circus performers gathered in the Big Top to practice their routines.\nGumshoe:\nThe practice session broke up around 10 PM.\nGumshoe:\nThe murder itself took place in the plaza in front of the lodging house at 10:15 PM.\nGumshoe:\nThe victim was found bent over a wooden box dead as a doornail.\nGumshoe:\nThe cause of death was blunt force trauma that snapped a vertebrae in his neck.\nMaya:\nThere wasn't much that we could go after Gumshoe with this time...\nPhoenix:\nHe gave us the facts, as he saw them. But there's gotta be more to this.\nMaya:\nI didn't see anything... But that's why you're the lawyer and I'm the medium.\nAfter pressing first and sixth statements and selecting \"About the contents\" upon pressing fifth statement:\nJudge:\nWell, I think we have a good feel for the details of the event now.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess that's all we're gonna get out of Gumshoe in this case...)\nMaya:\nYou mean all we're gonna get out of him is that little bottle of pepper?\nvon Karma:\nNow that we have wrapped up with the Detective, I'd like to call my next witness.\nGumshoe:\nEh? I'm not even off the stand yet!\nvon Karma:\nObviously... But that's due to you being slow and unable to take a hint!\nGumshoe:\nI dunno, but \"wrapped up\" has such a mean sound to it... I'm a sensitive guy...\nJudge:\nThank you very much, Detective Gumshoe. You may step down. Ms. von Karma. Call your next witness.\nvon Karma:\nI would like to call Mr. Benjamin Woodman to the stand.\nPhoenix:\n(She must be talking about Ben the ventriloquist...)\nMaya:\nI wonder if Trilo will show up on the stand as well...?\nvon Karma:\nPlease state your name and occupation for the record.\nTrilo:\nMy full name is Trilo Quist. I am employed as an opera tenor.\nJudge:\nEx-Excuse me! The witness called to the stand was one Mr. Benjamin Woodman, Ventriloquist.\nTrilo:\nThat robe must be cutting off your circulation. I said that I was a singer!! Maybe you don't believe me. Fine. I'll grace you with a song. *Ahem*... Mi mi mi mi mi! The world of the law... Exciting and daring... Guilt or innocence... Decided by a judge dressed up like a woman!! ...Well, what do you think?\nvon Karma:\n...\nJudge:\n...\nMaya:\nIt had a good rhythm...\nPhoenix:\nIt's just the lyrics... They leave something to be desired, so to speak.\nBen:\nT-Trilo! You know better than to insult a judge!!\nTrilo:\nShuddup! Just look at your nose. You would think you'd have the sense to fix it!! It's so ugly I want to punch you in the face on the off change swelling would help. You know that your nose is the reason you'll never be an A-List star.\nMaya:\nCelebrities must really enjoy saying everything that flashes into their minds.\nJudge:\nWhat's going on here!? Order! Order! I demand to know who the witness is!!\nBen:\nDon't... Don't worry about me, sir. I'll let Trilo handle this.\nJudge:\nI'm not worried about you one bit... I'm worried about getting testimony in my court! OUCH!!\nvon Karma:\nYou won't get anywhere trying to figure out this witness! Now let's proceed!\nWitness Testimony\n-- What You Witnessed --\nTrilo:\nOnce practice was over, I left the tent with the stooge... I mean clown.\nOnce we got to the lodging house, I ditched him and went back to the plaza's entrance. (Changed from [Once we got to the lodging house, I ditched him and went over to the plaza.] in the original release)\nThat's when I saw Max, heading towards the scene of the crime.\nHe was the only one heading that way... How could that punk not be the killer!?\nThen the police showed up, and took magic boy away.\nvon Karma:\nYou saw Maximillion Galactica heading towards the scene? You're sure of that?\nTrilo:\nWithout a doubt. He had on his silk hat, cloak, and the dumb white roses on his chest. How can you mistake someone with that crazy get-up and his nose stuck up so high...\nJudge:\nTh-That's enough... I think we all get the picture. Just one thing... You said you \"ditched\" the clown.\nTrilo:\nThat's right, dress-boy.\nJudge:\nWell, since you weren't with him, couldn't that mean the clown committed the crime?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... He's got a point.)\nvon Karma:\nWhat a shame... It was a nice theory, but the clown can't be the criminal.\nJudge:\nWhy's that?\nvon Karma:\nHere's absolute proof.\nJudge:\nA... silk hat?\nvon Karma:\nThis was found at the scene of the crime. It belongs to the defendant.\nPhoenix:\nAh...\nvon Karma:\nWithout question, he was wearing his signature hat during practice. If the clown was the murderer, there would be no reason for this hat to be at the scene.\nJudge:\nHmm... Well done, Ms. von Karma. Your prosecutorial skills are unrivaled. Well done.\nvon Karma:\nThank you for stating the obvious... Mr. Phoenix Wright, what do you have to say?\nPhoenix:\nO-OK... (I guess she's the boss again today...)\nCross Examination\n-- What You Witnessed --\nTrilo:\nOnce practice was over, I left the tent with the stooge... I mean clown.\nTrilo:\nOnce we got to the lodging house, I ditched him and went back to the plaza's entrance. (Changed from [Once we got to the lodging house, I ditched him and went over to the plaza.] in the original release)\nTrilo:\nThat's when I saw Max, heading towards the scene of the crime.\nTrilo:\nHe was the only one heading that way... How could that punk not be the killer!?\nTrilo:\nThen the police showed up, and took magic boy away.\nMaya:\nHmm... Trilo wouldn't happen to have an ulterior motive for incriminating Max, would he?\nPhoenix:\nWell, Max is part of that bitter love triangle with Regina. Which is probably why Max conked him over the head.\nMaya:\nUmm Nick... Wasn't Ben the one who got knocked over the head?\nPhoenix:\nUh... Yeah... I think so... I dunno anymore!\nPhoenix:\nAlright! There is obviously a reason why this witness was there that night! He spent all that time waiting for Regina to arrive! Moreover... Even if someone else would've walked right in front of him, I doubt he would have paid them a second thought!\nTrilo:\nAHHHH!!\nJudge:\nThat makes perfect sense.\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nWhat did you just say!? The witness saw the defendant at the scene of the crime!!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHowever, he did not see the victim on the way to his eventual demise! If you accept that, then you must accept that there is a high likelihood that... He could have missed someone else other than Max heading to the scene! OWWW!!\nvon Karma:\nThere is absolutely no proof that the witness was waiting for the animal tamer!\nTrilo:\nUmm... Umm... I guess you got me... Alright! Alright! I'll spill the beans for real this time! It's true. I was waiting for Regina.\nBen:\nPAIN!!\nvon Karma:\nDon't volunteer things!!\nJudge:\nMr. Quist, tell us the truth this time... And I mean the whole truth! Were you or were you not waiting for Regina at the entrance to the lodging house?\nTrilo:\nI was! I was waiting to propose to her!!\nJudge:\nYou were what!? Waiting to... propose!?\nTrilo:\nWhat's the matter!? You think that humans have a monopoly on marriage!?\nJudge:\nThat... The matter of puppet marriage is not under review in this case!\nTrilo:\nYou're the judge! I mean, look at your horrible outfit!!\nBen:\nMORE PAIN!!\nvon Karma:\nHmph. Thanks to your bumbling, my perfect plan is not so perfect anymore! Now we have to waste time getting to the bottom of some silly proposal by a puppet!!\nWitness Testimony\n-- About the Proposal --\nTrilo:\nDon't be so surprised that I was going to propose to Regina!\nI even had something to give to her...\nI kept it in my pocket, waiting for the chance to propose and give it to her.\nOf course, I also had it in my pocket that night. It was a present for her.\nIn the end, I wasn't able to give it to her, so I've still got it in my pocket!\nJudge:\nYou were going to propose... You... A puppet...\nTrilo:\nDon't be so obtuse! Just because I'm a puppet doesn't mean I can't love!\nJudge:\nI guess you're right... Just because I'm old doesn't mean I couldn't propose to her too!\nTrilo:\nExactly!\nPhoenix:\n(His Honor is looking a little less than honorable right now...)\nJudge:\nOK, Mr. Wright... Please continue with your examination... *sigh*\nMaya:\nWhat was with that sigh at the end... (Changed from [Aww... Did you hear that? His sigh seemed a little wistful.] in the original release)\nCross Examination\n-- About the Proposal --\nTrilo:\nDon't be so surprised that I was going to propose to Regina!\nTrilo:\nI even had something to give to her...\nTrilo:\nI planned on giving an engagement ring to Regina...\nTrilo:\nI kept it in my pocket, waiting for the chance to propose and give it to her.\nTrilo:\nOf course, I also had it in my pocket that night. It was a present for her.\nTrilo:\nIn the end, I wasn't able to give it to her, so I've still got it in my pocket!\nMaya:\nHow about it Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI think it's time to unwrap this toy's testimony.\nMaya:\nThat's the spirit Nick! Give him heck!\nPhoenix:\n(The judge has that dazed and confused look again. Maybe he should get out more.) (Changed from [Uh oh, the judge has that dazed look again. Maybe he should get out more.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nTrilo, do you mind if I show you something?\nBen:\nWhat is it?\nTrilo:\nWhat are you talking about!?\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh... Looks like they're going to double team me now...) Do you recognize this ring?\nTrilo:\nAh! That's... That's... That's mine!! Give it back! Thief! Thief!\nPhoenix:\nDidn't you just testify about this very object? I believe you said... \"In the end, I wasn't able to give it to her, so I've still got it in my pocket!\" Why then, do I have it right here...?\nTrilo:\nAAAAAAAAAARRRRRGHHHHH!!\nJudge:\nWhat is going on here!?\nTrilo:\nThat's... That's... Ben! Say something!!\nBen:\nEh? Don't put me on the spot like that Trilo!!\nPhoenix:\nI found this in Money's room...\nJudge:\nM-M-Money's room? You mean a room they put money, like a bank vault?\nTrilo:\nHah! That filthy monkey is gonna get what's coming to him!!\nJudge:\nMr. Quist, I would prefer if you avoided slandering innocent fiats in my court.\nPhoenix:\nWell, Your Honor... Money really is a monkey... In every sense of the word.\nJudge:\nAh. I see... Well then...\nPhoenix:\nMoney likes to go after the shiniest things that he can find and gather them up.\nJudge:\nShiny... Things?\nPhoenix:\nTrilo! When was this ring stolen from you?\nBen:\nWell... I suppose it was... That time... You know... That night... The night of the crime...\nvon Karma:\nWhat did you just say!?\nPhoenix:\nDetails... I need more details...\nBen:\nWell... It was stolen right after Max showed up in the plaza...\nPhoenix:\nRight about when you saw the defendant walk past, correct?\nBen:\nWell... Umm... I guess you... Might... Umm... Be able to say that... The ring might have... Well... It could have been... Taken around that time...\n???:\nOooo-Ooooh!\nBen:\nAhhhhh... Yeowwwwwwwww... Ohhhhhhhhhh...\nTrilo:\nBen! What's with you!? ... Oh, whatever... It has nothing to do with anything! Especially not who committed the murder!!\nPhoenix:\nIt's not for you to decide what has to do with what! Now, Trilo! Back to the topic at hand!\nTrilo:\nI haven't admitted a thing! Not I... Mr. Trilo Quist!\nPhoenix:\nWhat did you do when the ring was taken, Trilo?\nTrilo:\nYou know exactly what I did! I chased after that ring snatching monkey Money!!\nPhoenix:\nBut you weren't able to catch up with him, were you?\nTrilo:\nIt's all this slow loafy fool called Ben's fault! While he was fumbling his way through the snow, that dumb monkey was able to get away!\nJudge:\nThat is indeed an incredible shame.\nPhoenix:\nWell... This does indeed prove one very important point.\nvon Karma:\nProve an important point!? What point could that possibly be?\nPhoenix:\nThere is a huge contradiction in this witness's testimony!\nvon Karma:\nCo-Contradiction!?\nPhoenix:\nThe witness just testified to the following effect -- Up until the police arrived, he didn't move from the entrance to the plaza. HOWEVER! The witness just stated that he chased after Money the monkey. When the witness was off chasing Money, there was no one watching the plaza!\nvon Karma:\nWhat is the meaning of all this, Mr. Phoenix Wright!? Where are you going with this little theory of yours?\nPhoenix:\nI'm saying that there is no possible way that this witness saw the plaza the entire time! That's where I'm going with this little theory! Which leads me to my next point. It is entirely possible that someone other than the defendant was at the scene!\nJudge:\nInteresting, Mr. Wright.\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nWell then tell me this, Mr. Phoenix Wright!! Do you have any proof that something slipped past this vigilant ventriloquist?\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWell, he obviously didn't see the victim, the Ringmaster, arrive on the scene!\nvon Karma:\nHowever, that doesn't change the fact that he saw the defendant arrive!\nPhoenix:\nThe witness is lying! He is blinded by his rivalry with Max!\nJudge:\nWell... The defense's argument does hold water. This witness does have a history of animosity towards the defendant.\nTrilo:\nWhat!? How dare you!? I wouldn't lie just to get that dorkface in trouble! He's not even worth it!! I saw him! No doubt about it! I saw that worthless liar!\nJudge:\nWell... Just for clarity's sake, let's flesh out exactly who you saw on that night.\nTrilo:\nHah! I've told you so many times, you'd think you'd know my story's not changing!\nPhoenix:\n(You've already changed your story, stick boy! And I'm sure it will change some more.)\nMaya:\nWhere there is one lie, there are usually many more behind it.\nPhoenix:\nExactly, Maya. That's why we have to keep after him!\nMaya:\nYeah!\nWitness Testimony\n-- Witnessing Max --\nTrilo:\nI'll give you that I was waiting that night for Regina.\nBut that doesn't change the fact that I saw Max in the plaza that night!\nHe showed up after I had been waiting there for about five minutes.\nI said \"good evening\" to him, but he didn't even acknowledge my presence!\nI'm absolutely sure it was him! I saw Maximillion Galactica at the scene!!\nThere's no way I could mistake someone wearing those three ridiculous symbols!\nJudge:\nHmm...\nvon Karma:\nSo that means that Money didn't show up until after you saw Max?\nTrilo:\nThat's right. Money ran up less than a minute after I saw Max.\nPhoenix:\nThen Money snatched the ring, and you went chasing after him?\nJudge:\nHow long was it until you came back to where you were waiting?\nTrilo:\nWell. Let's see... I'd say about...\nBen:\nI suppose five minutes. I think...\nvon Karma:\nSo the victim could have arrived on the scene in that five minute stretch.\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, please proceed with your cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- Witnessing Max --\nTrilo:\nI'll give you that I was waiting that night for Regina.\nTrilo:\nBut that doesn't change the fact that I saw Max in the plaza that night!\nTrilo:\nHe showed up after I had been waiting there for about five minutes.\nTrilo:\nI said \"good evening\" to him, but he didn't even acknowledge my presence!\nTrilo:\nI'm absolutely sure it was him! I saw Maximillion Galactica at the scene!!\nTrilo:\nThere's no way I could mistake someone wearing those three ridiculous symbols!\nMaya:\nThere has to be a hole in his testimony somewhere.\nPhoenix:\nI agree. But do we have the proof to make something stick?\nMaya:\nAll we can do is try, right Nick!? We've gotta have something that will prove useful.\nPhoenix:\nAll right, time to go to work.\nPhoenix:\nTrilo, is it not true that you had a fight with Max on the day of the murder?\nvon Karma:\nA fight?\nPhoenix:\nA fight over Regina to be exact.\nTrilo:\nIt wasn't that big of a deal! It was just an argument... A disagreement at most!\nPhoenix:\nA disagreement usually doesn't end with someone getting clonked over the head...\nTrilo:\nAHHHH!!\nPhoenix:\nThat morning, Ben got clobbered over the head by Max, didn't he?\nJudge:\nWh-What? Is that an admission of assault and battery? OUCH!!\nvon Karma:\nBefore we handle that, we should wrap up the defendant's murder charge first!\nPhoenix:\nThe truth is that on the day of the crime, the defendant and witness had a huge fight! There is absolutely no way they would have suddenly become cordial that evening! Moreover, just consider the personality of the witness on stand! There is no way a puppet this lewd would just up and say \"good evening\" to his rival!\nTrilo:\nGWWAAAAHHHH!!\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nAre you saying this witness is lying!? That he is trying to frame the defendant by claiming to have seen him at the crime scene!?\nTrilo:\nI-I-I... I didn't tell a single lie! Honestly! I just...\nJudge:\nThat's enough from you Mr. Quist! Mr. Wright...\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nLet's clarify this testimony for the court... Could you explain your theory about who the witness actually saw that night?\nPhoenix:\nIt is my belief that the witness did indeed see someone that night... It was just someone else! That's who he said \"good evening\" to.\nvon Karma:\nWhat kind of theory is that!?\nPhoenix:\nThe correct one. Furthermore, I don't believe the person the witness saw was Max at all.\nvon Karma:\nWh-What!?\nPhoenix:\nIf he had truly met Max that night, there would have been no greeting at all. Which means there is only one proper answer. The person the witness saw that night was not Maximillion Galactica. That is why Trilo made the effort to greet whoever it was that he saw that evening. Or \"good evening\" as he put it.\nTrilo:\nUhh...\nvon Karma:\nWhat in the world... You...\nJudge:\nWould the defense kindly explain who it was Trilo saw that evening then?\nPhoenix:\nConsidering the ill temper of this witness, there is only one person he would greet!\nJudge:\nIt must be Regina! It's Regina right!? She's so cute!!\nPhoenix:\nNo, Your Honor, it is not Regina. If it was Regina, Trilo would have given her the engagement ring as a present.\nJudge:\nOh... Yeah... I suppose you've got a point there.\nvon Karma:\nIt was Russell Berry. The victim himself, was it not?\nPhoenix:\nYou are correct. It was indeed Russell Berry.\nTrilo:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nThe person you saw that evening was the victim, the Ringmaster, Russell Berry. That's why you greeted him Trilo. Isn't that correct?\nTrilo:\n... *gulp*\nPhoenix:\nAnswer the question, Mr. Quist!\nTrilo:\nWAAAAHHHH!! AH!\nJudge:\nORDER! ORDER! How do you respond to this!?\nTrilo:\nWa-Wait a second!! Well, at first I thought it was the old man! But! But! Once I got a better look at him, it was obviously Maximillion Galactica!\nJudge:\nI think it is high time that we clear the air about this question! Mr. Quist obviously witnessed a single person in the area of the plaza that evening. The problem is identifying exactly who that person was... Was it Maximillion Galactica? Or was it the Ringmaster, one Mr. Russell Berry?\nvon Karma:\nThe prosecution argues that it was the defendant that the witness saw that night! The witness has clearly stated that he saw the defendant's three symbols!\nPhoenix:\nThree symbols?\nTrilo:\nAlright... This is getting old. C'mon man! You've gotta remember them by now!! Here we go again! Everyone... All together now!! OWWWWW!!\nvon Karma:\nYes, yes... We know... The silk hat, cloak, and white roses...\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nA silk hat and a cloak! Anyone could wear them! They'd even look good on me!\nvon Karma:\nWhat was that!?\nPhoenix:\nWell, the witness has endlessly repeated that he saw Max's three symbols... However, how do we really know it was Maximillion Galactica? It could have been someone else, dressed up as him. Possibly even Russell Berry!\nvon Karma:\nWHAT!?\nJudge:\nMs. von Karma.\nvon Karma:\n...\nJudge:\nDo you have clear evidence that the person the witness saw was the defendant?\nvon Karma:\nWell... I...\nJudge:\nIf that's the case, then it is impossible for me to make a judgment at this point.\nPhoenix:\n(Yes! I think we've finally won a point in this one!!)\nvon Karma:\n... That is very... Unfortunate.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nvon Karma:\nYou're just a little too excited for your own good, Mr. Phoenix Wright.\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean by that?\nvon Karma:\nYou merely established one thing from this witness. You established that this witness saw one person in the plaza that night. I applaud you on your effort, but...\nJudge:\nBut...?\nvon Karma:\nWho that person was can only be answered by the next witness!\nPhoenix:\nHUH!?\nvon Karma:\nYour Honor, the prosecution will provide, beyond a shadow of a doubt, an answer to that question, and evidence that clearly establishes one thing. That there is no one other than Maximillion Galactica responsible for this crime!\nJudge:\nVery well. The court will take a 10 minute recess. During that time, I request the prosecution prepare their next witness. Court is now in recess!\nTo be continued.\nDecember 29, 11:54 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 5\nMax:\nSw-Sweetie! You have to believe me! I didn't go anywhere near that crime scene!\nMaya:\nSo then, where were you when the murder took place?\nMax:\nWe talked about it yesterday, remember? I was in the Ringmaster's room!\nPhoenix:\nAnd while you were there, it was the Ringmaster who left the room, right?\nMax:\nExactly. He told me to wait in the room because he would \"be right back\".\nMaya:\nThat's when the Ringmaster headed to the scene of the crime... Right?\nPhoenix:\nThat's what it seems like.\nMaya:\nBut... The Ringmaster must've been wearing Max's costume. Right?\nMax:\nOh! Sweetie! I just remembered! I went straight to the Ringmaster's room still dressed in my stage clothes. But when I got there, I went ahead and took the costume off.\nMaya:\nWhich means?\nPhoenix:\nIt means that the Ringmaster could have taken his costume, and went out looking like Max!\nMax:\nFABULOUS! That's a fabulously possible possibility!\nMaya:\nHeh Heh... Well done, Nick.\nMax:\nHowever, sweetie... Why would the Ringmaster want to dress up like me? Isn't that a bit strange?\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\nMax:\nIf you think about it, all they found at the crime scene was my silk hat. What about my cloak? Where did that go?\nPhoenix:\nDouble hmm...\nMaya:\nWow Max. I never thought of that. You should be a detective or something!\nMax:\nWell, I was never quite sure what to be when I grew up... Magician or President? You have no idea how hard it was to make a decision!\nMaya:\nThat's really cool...\nPhoenix:\n(Fabulous... This mystery just keeps getting deeper...)\nDecember 29, 12:06 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2\nJudge:\nNow that everyone is back, let's get started. The court is now back in session.

Name and occupation.\nJudge:\nWill the witness please inform the court why he is speaking autobiographical gibberish?\nMoe:\nO-Oh... I-I'm sorry... I'm just not used to being in court. I've never been in a courtroom in my life. I wasn't quite sure what joke is best suited to this sort of occasion.\nJudge:\nWhat in the world are you talking about!? You're in a grand hall of justice, not some comedy club! Since it's easy to see your occupation, please state your name for the court.\nMoe:\n... Oh... Yeah... Maybe this joke is OK... \"Mom, do I have to wear pants?\" \"The sign only says no shirt, no shoes, no service.\" Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\n.....................\nMoe:\nOK! OK! How about this? \"Have you met my proctologist? Dr. Seymour Butts!!\" How was that one!? Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! ...But a couple of clowns who were up to no good... Started makin' trouble in... (Changed from [...But a couple of clowns, they were up to no good... Started makin' trouble in...] in the original release)\nvon Karma:\nYour name...\nMoe:\nLawrence Curls. Professional funnyman, also known as Moe the clown.\nvon Karma:\nYou witnessed the scene at around 10:15 PM the day of the murder. Correct?\nMoe:\nYes... Yes it is.\nJudge:\nVery well, Mr. Curls. Will you please testify to what you saw that evening?\nMoe:\nA rabbi, a priest, and a Rastafarian walked into this plaza...\nJudge:\nWithout the humor please.\nMoe:\nOK...\nMaya:\nAww... Poor Moe can't be his normal stoogey self in court.\nWitness Testimony\n-- What You Witnessed --\nMoe:\nI know... I know... I'm not the greatest comedian in the world...\nI haven't been able to make people laugh for 10 years!\nNo matter what I say, all I get in return is a vacant stare and polite applause.\nSince no one ever laughs at my jokes, I've taken to laughing at them myself.\nIt's a bad habit, but hey, at least I'm trying!!\nImagine my predicament! I'm a clown who can't make people laugh!! I'm almost useless!\nBut I keep trying... I even tried to come up with jokes just for today!!\nBut this atmosphere is very nerve-racking! I decided to try making everyone laugh!\nSeriously... Everyone... What do you think of me? How am I doing?\nJudge:\n...\nvon Karma:\n...\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Aren't we the ones supposed to be asking the questions here?\nvon Karma:\nWitness...\nMoe:\nHuh?\nvon Karma:\nWe will listen to your call for help after the court proceedings are over. Thus, please stick with the facts of this case.\nMoe:\nReally!? You'll really hear me out!?\nvon Karma:\nWell, I'll make sure that one of my staff will be your straight man later.\nMoe:\nThank you!! Thank you!! I can't wait!!\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Gumshoe...)\nJudge:\nNow that that's settled, shall we begin once again with the testimony!?\nMoe:\nOf course we can! I'll talk for as long as you want!!\nWitness Testimony\n-- What You Witnessed --\nMoe:\nThe night of the murder, after practice was over, I went straight back to my room.\nYou have no idea how tired I was that night. I was pooped.\nI thought I'd go straight to sleep, but before I did, I glanced out the window.\nThat's when I saw two silhouettes! They were a bit far away though!\nIt was the Ringmaster, and he was with Max, who was wearing his cloak!\nI kept watching them, and all of a sudden, Max clonked the Ringmaster over the head!\nJudge:\nThat's very interesting... If this eyewitness account is to be believed, I have enough to pass judgment right now...\nvon Karma:\nOf course you can! There is no way that this account can be criticized.\nJudge:\nHowever... The witness is a bit, how do you say, \"off-kilter\"... Almost like he has some sort of atmosphere of guilt surrounding him.\nMoe:\nAha! Aha! Aha! That must be because of my insincere smile...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, please begin the defense's cross-examination.\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.\nMaya:\nNick! You've gotta find some kind of contradiction in his testimony!\nPhoenix:\nI know that!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor?\nJudge:\nI'm afraid that if you push this witness too far, it would bring disaster upon the court. Thus, I sincerely hope you are not going to engage in pointless saber-rattling.\nPhoenix:\nI understand, Your Honor.\nvon Karma:\nIf you cause this clown to stray from the facts, I'll hold you responsible!\nPhoenix:\n(Why am I responsible!? I'm not the one with the corny jokes.)\nCross Examination\n-- What You Witnessed --\nMoe:\nThe night of the murder, after practice was over, I went straight back to my room.\nMoe:\nYou have no idea how tired I was that night. I was pooped.\nMoe:\nI thought I'd go straight to sleep, but before I did, I glanced out the window.\nMoe:\nI heard a huge noise outside the window, and that's what made me take a look outside...\nMoe:\nThat's when I saw two silhouettes! They were a bit far away though!\nMoe:\nIt was the Ringmaster, and he was with Max, who was wearing his cloak!\nMoe:\nI kept watching them, and all of a sudden, Max clonked the Ringmaster over the head!\nMaya:\nYou know... Moe's testimony and what he told us yesterday are kinda different...\nPhoenix:\nYeah I noticed. We've just got to pinpoint what's changed.\nMaya:\nYou can do it, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nI've got a great reason to make my claim!\nvon Karma:\nAnd I suppose you will be telling us all that \"great\" reason?\nPhoenix:\nOf course I will... The reason is... The witness' very own testimony!\nJudge:\nWhat is the meaning of that Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nMoe said that he heard a sound like a \"thump\" of someone getting hit.\nJudge:\nHmm... He did say that.\nPhoenix:\nHowever, Moe just stated the following under oath.\nMoe:\nI kept watching them, and all of a sudden, Max clonked the Ringmaster over the head!\nPhoenix:\nIf Moe is to be believed when he says he looked out the window upon hearing a sound, there is no way that he could have seen Max \"clonk\" anyone!\nMoe:\nIn 1972, a crack clown unit was sent to prison by a circus court for a crime...\nJudge:\nMr. Curls! How do you respond to Mr. Wright's assessment!!?\nMoe:\n...they didn't commit. These clowns promptly escaped from a maximum security clown car...\nJudge:\nMr. Curls, are you reciting the C-Team theme to anger this court?\nMoe:\nNo no no... I'm just stalling for time while I jog my memory...\nMaya:\nGreat job, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nThese types of witnesses always seem to have a selective memory... You just have to peel back the layers of the clown make-up to find the truth.\nMoe:\nWell... Umm...\nJudge:\nAhh, you're back from your jog?\nMoe:\nWell... It pretty much happened the way I said.\nPhoenix:\n\"Pretty much\"...?\nMoe:\nWhen I looked out my window that night, the Ringmaster was already face down in the snow. The prosecution helped me fill in the gaps of my statement.\nPhoenix:\n(Von... Von Karma!! Tampering with witnesses again!!)\nvon Karma:\n...\nJudge:\nSo now you are saying that you did not see the defendant \"clonk\" the Ringmaster?\nMoe:\nY-Yes... When I looked out my window, the Ringmaster had already checked out.\nJudge:\nChecked out?\nMoe:\nYep. He was on permanent vacation as they say. Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nJudge:\nMr. Curls!!\nMoe:\nYour Honor?\nJudge:\nYou did not witness the actual crime; however, you still say you saw the criminal, correct?\nMoe:\nY-Y-YES!! Exactly! The Ringmaster was slumped over and I saw someone's silhouette next to him.\nJudge:\nVery well. Then please testify to this silhouette you saw... I expect the truth! And if I even catch a hint of a joke from you... I will put you in a holding cell until you learn court etiquette, got it!?\nMoe:\nGot it.\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Silhouette --\nMoe:\nI was a bit far away, but that shadow could only have belonged to Max.\nThere's no doubting it. Especially since I saw his uppity symbols.\nHis silk hat. That black cloak. They were all there!\nHis face was silhouetted, but there was no doubt that it was him.\nHis cloak was fluttering in the wind, so I couldn't really see what he was carrying.\nJudge:\nHmm... It does seem as if the defendant was at the scene of the crime.\nvon Karma:\nIt took the clown long enough to get his facts straight. (Changed from [You took your time realizing that, didn't you!?] in the original release) But whatever. This should finally be good enough, yes? (Changed from [Whatever. That should be enough, right!?] in the original release)\nJudge:\nIt is decisive testimony...\nMaya:\nWas Max really at the crime scene that night...?\nPhoenix:\nHe said he wasn't there. We have to believe in that. (Changed from [He said he wasn't there. We have to keep believing that.] in the original release)\nJudge:\nAlright, Mr. Wright. Commence your cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- The Silhouette --\nMoe:\nI was a bit far away, but that shadow could only have belonged to Max.\nMoe:\nThere's no doubting it. Especially since I saw his uppity symbols.\nMoe:\nHis silk hat. That black cloak. They were all there!\nMoe:\nHis face was silhouetted, but there was no doubt that it was him.\nMoe:\nHis cloak was fluttering in the wind, so I couldn't really see what he was carrying.\nPhoenix:\n(With Trilo's testimony, and now Moe's... It really seems like Max is the killer.)\nMaya:\nN-Nick... You've gotta find a contradiction in this.\nPhoenix:\nThat's not going to be enough...\nMaya:\nWhat?\nPhoenix:\nI have to prove that Moe saw someone other than Max that night! That's the only thing that will help! I've gotta do it!\nPhoenix:\nYou say you saw all of Max's \"uppity\" symbols?\nMoe:\nI suppose so... The silk hat and the cloak, right?\nPhoenix:\nMoe... Everyone knows that Maximillion Galactica has three uppity symbols!\nMoe:\nThree symbols?\nMaya:\nYay! Everyone get ready!! All... Together... Now...\n\"SILK HAT! CLOAK! WHITE ROSES!\"\nMoe:\nWhat the!?\nvon Karma:\nWho cares if he knew that there were three or not! He saw what he saw. And he saw the symbols. He just forgot to mention one.\nMoe:\n...\nvon Karma:\nIsn't that right, Moe?\nMoe:\n... Do you like Pi? I love Pi! 3.141592653589793238462643383279! Tasty!\nvon Karma:\nSilence fool! You are to respond with the whole truth! No fractions!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order!\nPhoenix:\nMoe! You didn't see the roses, did you!?\nMoe:\nTo be honest... There wasn't any roses on the person I saw...\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nThe crime scene was dark! It's obvious it was too dark to see that kind of detail!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nBut the witness said he was able to see the silhouette of the criminal's face. Not to mention that the roses are white! There's no way he could have missed them!\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nThen the roses must have fallen off when the defendant assaulted the victim!\nPhoenix:\nIf that was the case, then the police would have found them near the crime scene!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Are these white roses truly material to the facts of this case?\nvon Karma:\nClearly not! He is just toying with this court!\nPhoenix:\n... (I got her on the ropes now... These seemingly insignificant facts have never failed to lead me to the truth yet! (Changed from [Whenever there's a nugget of truth, it always seems to peek out at me... Then run away.] in the original release)) Someone is toying with the court, but it's not me! Your Honor! Do you recall Trilo's testimony?\nTrilo:\nThere's no way I could mistake someone wearing those three ridiculous symbols!\nTrilo:\nHow can you mistake someone with that crazy get-up and his nose stuck up so high...\nTrilo:\nHow could you mistake someone wearing such a snobby 3 piece get-up!\nPhoenix:\nTrilo saw them all! Trilo saw all three of Max's symbols! However, this witness claims there were no white roses on the person he saw! There is absolutely no doubt that this is a contradiction!\nJudge:\nHmm... Now what am I supposed to think? One is supposed to disregard the pointless, but this...\nvon Karma:\nJudge! Forget the roses! Think about his other testimony! The witness has stated without a doubt that he saw Maximillion Galactica! Nothing else matters! Let's wrap this case up now!\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! It may be trivial, but it does cast doubt on the prosecution's case. (Changed from [Your Honor! It may be trivial, but there should still be doubt lingering in your mind!] in the original release)\nJudge:\n... Frankly, I have my doubts about this witness. It seems that, unlike wine, the witness has not grown more mature with age.\nMoe:\nI'm not... mature...\nJudge:\nI've come to a conclusion... I'm 99% certain that this witness saw the defendant. However! My remaining one percent of doubt is quite reasonable! Which means that for my peace of mind, I'm going to request a bit more testimony.\nvon Karma:\nW-What!?\nJudge:\nIf there are no contradictions in his next statement, I am prepared to issue a ruling.\nPhoenix:\n(A ruling...!!)\nMaya:\nNick! This is your last chance!\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Silhouette, Part 2 --\nMoe:\nThere's no doubt in my mind! There were no white roses that night!\nHowever, all of the other symbols were there... I'm equally sure of that.\nEspecially the silk hat! There is no way I could forget seeing the decorations on it!\nHe was wearing it the entire time that he was on the scene!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright... You've got one last chance at this.\nPhoenix:\nJust one chance?\nJudge:\nI will not allow even the slightest hint of badgering against this witness. If you are going to prove to me there's a contradiction with Mr. Curls' statement, you'd better have at least a shred of evidence to back up your accusations.\nPhoenix:\n(I've only got a single shot as [sic] this... I've got to be careful.) I understand, Your Honor. One chance is all I will need!\nCross Examination\n-- The Silhouette, Part 2 --\nMoe:\nThere's no doubt in my mind! There were no white roses that night!\nMoe:\nHowever, all of the other symbols were there... I'm equally sure of that.\nMoe:\nEspecially the silk hat! There is no way I could forget seeing the decorations on it!\nMoe:\nHe was wearing it the entire time that he was on the scene!\nMaya:\nWhaddya think, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nThere's no way I'm going to lose after coming this far. There's gotta be an answer. And it's probably in the Court Record!\nPhoenix:\nThis wouldn't happen to be the silk hat you saw that night, would it?\nMoe:\nYep! That's it! That's the hat he was wearing that night!\nPhoenix:\nNo question in your mind?\nMoe:\nExactly how would one mistake a thing like that!?\nPhoenix:\nI see...\nJudge:\nIs there some sort of problem, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nMs. von Karma. Where exactly was the silk hat found?\nvon Karma:\nMust you always ask these questions!? It was found at the crime scene!! ... The c-c-crime scene... That means...\nPhoenix:\nThe silk hat fell off at the crime scene! However the witness clearly testified to the contrary!! The witness stated that \"he was wearing it the entire time that he was on the scene!\"\nMoe:\nNoooooOOOOOooooo!! That's not trrrrrruuuuueeee!!\nJudge:\nORDER! ORDER!! OOORRRDER!! MR. CURLS!!\nMoe:\nY-Yes, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nWHAT IS THE MEANING OF ALL OF THIS!? You are old enough to know better than to behave like this in court!\nMoe:\nHey! That's just not right!! That's so harsh!\nJudge:\nWhat's not right here is your eyesight and your memory, amongst other things!!\nMoe:\n............... Wh... Why are you being so mean to me!! What did I do!? Lemme guess... You just didn't like my jokes or something, right? You didn't have to go and insult my eyesight or my memory!? They're both great! Seriously!! Why!? Just because you are sitting above me doesn't mean you belong there! And no matter how old I get, I'll always be younger than you!! WAAAAAHHHHHHHH!! *sob* (Changed from [And no matter how old I get, I'll always be younger you!! [sic] WAAAAAHHHHHHHH!! *sobs*] in the original release)\n...\nJudge:\n... Enough of these childish outbursts, Mr. Curls! Who do you think you are?\nMoe:\nI saw him! I swear I saw him!! It was Max!! Even if he didn't have his roses, he was still wearing his dumb silk hat!! I'm telling the truth!!\nMaya:\nHe's turned into a bratty little kid.\nPhoenix:\nIt's pitiful, isn't it?\nMoe:\nHe left the scene wearing that dumb silk hat! He was there!!\nPhoenix:\n(He... left the scene?)\nMaya:\nWhat's the matter, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nThere's something I've been mulling over for a while now. Moe?\nMoe:\nWhaddya want!?\nPhoenix:\nYou just said that he left the scene... Exactly how did the murderer leave the scene of the crime?\nMoe:\nWHAT!? He... Umm... He... Went... Whaddya mean \"how did he leave the scene\"? You can't ask me that!!\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nMr. Phoenix Wright is badgering the witness, Your Honor!!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThis witness's testimony is so full of holes, Ms. von Karma's protest is useless!\nvon Karma:\nGrrrr...\nJudge:\nYou've got a point. Let's hear what the witness has to say on this matter. Is that alright with you, little guy?\nMoe:\nDon't talk to me like I'm a little baby!! Besides, what kind of stupid question is \"how did he leave the crime scene!?\" The answer's obvious! He just turned around and walked away!!\nPhoenix:\nThat's what I expected you'd say... You sure that's how it happened?\nMoe:\nSay what!? (Changed from [Hmph!!] in the original release)\nJudge:\nHuh? I'm not sure I know exactly where you're going with this... Lawyers nowadays sure do love to harp on the smallest things. Do you have any proof to counter his story as to how the criminal left the scene?\nPhoenix:\nLook at this picture. The problem is the footprints in the snow...\nJudge:\nFootprints?\nPhoenix:\nIn this photo, we can clearly see the footprints of the victim! However, where are the criminal's footprints? They aren't there!!\nMoe:\nAi-yai-yai-yai-yai!!\nPhoenix:\nSo Moe, exactly how did the criminal escape the scene?\nMoe:\nUmm... He... Uh...\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! This witness has already proven that his testimony is completely unreliable! I move to strike all of this witness's testimony from the court record!\nJudge:\nI agree... This clown's testimony is as rickety as the clown car he came to court in.\nMoe:\nWAIT JUST A SECOND!! You guys can't just ignore everything I've said!! Fine fine! I'll tell you the truth this time...\nvon Karma:\nYOU WAIT A SECOND! I think you've said more than enough for today!!\nMoe:\nThat didn't hurt!! I'm sick and tired of listening to you anyways!! I'll give you the real deal this time... I swear!!\nMaya:\nI dunno why, but I get the feeling things are gonna get worse before they get better.\nJudge:\nMr. Lawrence Curls.\nMoe:\nYes!?\nJudge:\nThe testimony you've provided up until now has been false?\nMoe:\nIt hasn't been false! I haven't lied! It's just...\nJudge:\nIt's just what?\nMoe:\nIt's just I was a bit confused on the bit about the criminal leaving the scene. Especially since Von Karma and her whip told me not to talk about what I really saw!\nJudge:\nORDER!! ORDER!! I WILL HAVE ORDER!! Franziska von Karma!! How could you!!\nvon Karma:\nYour Honor... If you had heard the truth from this witness... You would have exactly the same opinion as I have.\nJudge:\nWhat opinion is that?\nvon Karma:\nIt's not funny!\nJudge:\nThat's enough out of you! I'm going to listen to what he has to say. Now then, let's hear the truth about what you say you saw, Mr. Curls! (Changed from [Now then, let's hear the truth about what you say you saw!] in the original release)\nMoe:\nHah!

He...\nThis is the truth now, get ready for it!\nHe flew! He jumped up and flew through the air!!\nHe flew right off and disappeared into the darkness!\nThat's why there were no footprints! Flying people don't leave footprints!\nvon Karma:\nI told you it wasn't funny. Do you believe me now?\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\n...\n.....................\nJudge:\nWell... That was... Umm... How do you put this into words...\nvon Karma:\nMaximillion Galactica is a world-class magician. But to leave the scene of a crime by flying -- there's no way that actually happened. (Changed from [But to leave the scene of a crime by flying. There's no way that actually happened.] in the original release)\nJudge:\nYou... You're right.\nMoe:\nWhy is she right!? You believed the other witnesses! Why won't you believe me!? Especially since it's the best part of the story!!\nJudge:\nHmm... To be honest, this is the first time I've heard of a flying criminal. What do you think about this witness' testimony, Mr. Wright?\nJudge:\nI suppose I will let you all in on my thinking regarding this matter... \"The criminal disappeared into the sky.\" I'd love to believe that... But I just can't wrap my head around how that could actually happen.\nvon Karma:\nYou imbecile!\nJudge:\nIf you disregard a need for proof, Ms. von Karma's case is sound. However... I've got the feeling that this case is in dire need of more investigation.\nvon Karma:\n...!\nJudge:\nThus I will conclude today's proceedings at this point! It's an undisputed fact that the criminal left no footprints at the scene. Tomorrow, I want us to find out the reason behind this mystery of mysteries.\nPhoenix:\nUmm, uhh...\nvon Karma:\nGrrr...\nJudge:\nI believe that's enough for today. Court is adjourned!

I can't fly whenever I please. It's not that easy!!\nMaya:\nBut it looks so effortless for you on stage...\nMax:\nIt's not that simple!! I'm not actually flying on stage!

(Changed from [But I can never figure out the tricks when I see them. I'm just not good at it...] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nThat's because the tricks are performed by pros. They do it so you can't guess the trick.\nMaya:\nBut but... The trick Pearly showed me was incredible!\nPhoenix:\nPearls did a magic trick? Hmm... What kind of trick was it?\nMaya:\nLet's see. It looked like she pulled the end of her own thumb off!\nPhoenix:\nHeh...\nMaya:\nFirst she put her right thumb next to her left hand, and then it just separated! She could move it up and down and everything! It was incredible!\nPhoenix:\nReally? Was it kinda like this...?\nMaya:\nWHAT!? WOW! HOW'D YOU DO THAT!? Nick, you're like a real magician!

I know how you feel.] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nLet me tell you something, pal. Listening to that old clown sucks all your energy. Every time he's done talkin' he looks at you like you should be doing something...\nPhoenix:\nUmm... I think he's waiting for you to laugh at his jokes.\nGumshoe:\nI know that, pal. Do you have any idea how much your face hurts if you fake laughing that much?\nMaya:\nFranziska really set you up bad this time, didn't she? If you ask me, she should be listening to Moe herself...\nGumshoe:\nNo way, pal. You're not gonna get me to backbite a woman with a whip. No way.\nMaya:\nWhy are you defending her?\nGumshoe:\nProsecutor von Karma's always got her eyes on us. And every time you definitely don't want her to show up... *poof* There she is!! Don't show up... Don't show up... Don't show up... Don't show up... Don't show up...\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like she's wound him pretty tight...)\nGumshoe:\nShe's directly above us as we speak.\nMaya:\nHuh? How's that possible?\nGumshoe:\nAccording to the clown, the criminal jumped from here and disappeared into the sky. If that's what happened, it means the killer passed right by this window, pal.\nMaya:\nOh, I see... Who lives in that room behind the window up there?\nGumshoe:\nThe acrobat's got his room up on the third floor, it seems. Pretty soon, Ms. von Karma's gonna start her investigation up there. So don't get any ideas of going up to the acrobat's room, got it pal?\nMaya:\n*shivers* F-Franziska von Karma... (Changed from [*shivers* V-Von Karma...] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Once she's done with her investigation, I think I'll go up there and check it out.)\nDecember 29Lodging Hall 1st FloorMoe's Room\nPhoenix:\nMoe's not here...\nMaya:\nIf he was here, you would have been able to tell even before you stepped into his room. I'm sure you would've heard him laughing away... \"Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\"\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you think he is laughing at when he's all by himself?\nMaya:\nI always thought he was just thinking up new jokes.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... He must really love his work...)\nAfter visiting Moe's Room:\nDecember 29Big TopCafeteria\nMoe:\nAh! Wright!! Welcome to the wonderful, the fabulous, the cafeteria!\nPhoenix:\n(Yikes... He's in an awfully good mood...)\nMoe:\nAlright! You know what time it is!! Riddle time!! Why does everyone cry when they eat Mexican pizza?\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nMoe:\nC'mon! You can answer this! It's easy!!\nPhoenix:\n...Because cafeteria Mexican pizza is possibly a weapon of bowel destruction?\nMoe:\n*BUZZ* Wrong! Try again! OK! What do you think, girlie?\nMaya:\nUmm... Ahh! I got it!!\nMoe:\nOK!! What is your answer?\nMaya:\nBecause they are in the Café Teary Eye!\nMoe:\nExactly!! It's an incredibly sad place, that café. Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nMaya:\nI did it!!\nPhoenix:\n(What's going on? He's being too nice...)\nDetention Center\nBig Top - Ringmaster's Room (after presenting Note in Detention Center - Visitor's Room)\nAfter presenting Note in Detention Center - Visitor's Room, then examining tailcoat in Big Top - Ringmaster's Room:\nDecember 29Big TopCafeteria\nMaya:\nWha...?

Just thinking about it is making me hungry! All of a sudden I need a burger bad!!\nPhoenix:\n(All of a sudden, I need a new partner...

But with Ms. von Karma...\n...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*...\nMaya:\nNick, what is that? That beeping sound?\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\nGumshoe:\nIt's Ms. von Karma.\nMaya:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nEvery time I hear that sound, she's usually not very far behind!\nPhoenix:\nSome sort of pager or something?\nGumshoe:\nIf you don't mind pal, I'm gonna go ahead and get outta here... Quick. See ya, pal!!\nMaya:\nI didn't know that Gumshoe could run that fast! So much for being a flatfoot.\nPhoenix:\n(Never seen a grown man so afraid of a girl still in her teens!)\nMaya:\nWell, let's go inside... It's freezing out here! The wind's as biting as... (Changed from [Uh oh... The whi...] in the original release) OWWWW!! ...As biting as lashes from a whip!!

What can I do for you?\nvon Karma:\nTomorrow will be the day. The day my dream finally comes true!\nPhoenix:\nYou mean the story of my defeat at your hands making the national news?\nvon Karma:\nHa ha ha... National news? You possess such a small sense of scale... The global news, Mr. Phoenix Wright! Your miserable plight will be known internationally!\nPhoenix:\n(I think she might be overestimating the importance of a win by just a smudge...)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nMaya:\nN-N-Nick! Umm... About Mr. Edgeworth...! (Changed from [N-N-Nick! Umm... About Edgeworth?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nMaya, I already told you this once. Don't make me do it again. Don't bring up his name in front of me again, OK?\nMaya:\nN-Nick...?\nPhoenix:\nMs. von Karma? (Changed from [Von Karma?] in the original release)\nvon Karma:\nWhat?\nPhoenix:\nI don't know if you are god's gift to prosecutors or not, but I've had about enough of you!! Him, too!\nMaya:\nWha... What in the world happened...? (Changed from [Wha... What happened?] in the original release)\nvon Karma:\nHmph. This dog is all bark and no bite. He's already been defeated...

It seems you've got things you want to talk about, so fire away.\nPhoenix:\nBat and Regina...\nAcro:\nThey were such great friends. Oh yeah... I wanted you to take a look at this.\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it?\nAcro:\nThis is the scarf my brother was wearing when Léon attacked him.\nMaya:\nGross... It's covered in blood.\nAcro:\nThis scarf... It was a present from Regina to my brother on the day of the accident.

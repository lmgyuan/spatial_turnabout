I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts.\nI-It wasn't me! I swear it wasn't me!\nJudge:\nThe evidence and testimony we have seen and heard are conclusive! The victim was alone at his table when he drank from that poisoned cup of coffee.\nNo! You're wrong! I know what I saw...! I saw... I saw...! I saw someone else there! A man. He's the real killer! Why won't anyone believe me?\nPayne:\nWell... I'd say that pretty much wraps this case up, wouldn't you... ...Mr. Wright!?\nJudge:\nThis court finds the defendant...\nGuilty\nJudge:\nThe court is adjourned.\nJanuary 6, 10:03 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nMaya:\nAhh! The start of the new year always makes me feel like I can take on the whole world!\nPhoenix:\nI bet it does, Maya.\nMaya:\nSo! I've decided that our resolution should be... Zvarri! \"Take on the world!\" What do you think?\nPhoenix:\nSure, whatever, Maya... But I think maybe you've had more than enough mistletoe cake.\nMaya:\nNever! You've got to eat a lot of cake during New Year's! It's practically a tradition! Like watching the fireworks on TV or playing a board game.\n???:\nHEY, PAL!\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe...\nMaya:\nHappy New Year, Detective!\nGumshoe:\nUh... likewise... NOW LISTEN UP, WRIGHT! I WANNA...\nMaya:\nHere's to another fruitful year of lawyer-police cooperation!\nGumshoe:\nUm... Yeah... Me too... ALRIGHT, PAL! YOU'VE GOT SOME EXPLAINING TO...\nMaya:\nHave you got a holiday present for me, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nA what? Well... I, um... Here, have this. It-It's really nothing much, but...\nMaya:\nYay! Thanks!\nGumshoe:\nLOOK, PAL, WE NEED TO HAVE A TALK. TAKE A SEAT!\nMaya:\nHey! What about Pearly? You haven't forgotten her present, have you?\nGumshoe:\nAh... N-No... I mean, yes... I mean, no... Are you doing this on purpose?\nMaya:\nHa ha, guess I'm busted. How did you like my first practical joke of the year?\nGumshoe:\nVery funny, pal. Now let's see how funny you think it is when I show you this!\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it? A magazine?\nMaya:\nHey, I wanna see! \"Deadly Poisoning Brings Guilty Verdict. Defense Attorney Wright Trounced.\"\nPhoenix:\nTr-Trounced!? Let me see that! \"The defense attorney gave an almost childishly amateur performance yesterday...\" What the heck is this!?\nGumshoe:\nIt's a report, pal. About you!\nMaya:\nListen to this! \"Mr. Wright must take full responsibility for the ruling in this case.\"\nGumshoe:\nWELL!? And don't tell me you don't remember anything about it!\nPhoenix:\nBut I don't remember anything about it! When was that issue from anyway?\nGumshoe:\nUmm... December of last year, which I guess makes it last month.\nMaya:\nWhich makes it old news, you mean.\nPhoenix:\nBut I wasn't involved in a poisoning case in December!\nMaya:\nHmm, so what do you think this is all about, Nick?\nGumshoe:\nIf it wasn't you, pal, then that leaves only one possibility...\nMaya:\nNo way. You don't mean...\nPhoenix:\nA pho...\nMaya:\nA phony Nick!?\nPhoenix:\n(This must be Gumshoe's idea of a joke. Guess he's starting off the year with one, too...)\nMagazine Clipping added to the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\nSO!? What are you gonna do about it, pal!?\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean, what am I going to do about it?\nMaya:\nWell, it's your fault that the judge found the defendant guilty in this case!\nPhoenix:\nMy fault!? How do you figure that?\nMaya:\nBecause THE Phoenix Wright is super famous now! Well, maybe only sort of...\nGumshoe:\nYeah. See what happens when you hotshots start getting too full of yourselves?\nPhoenix:\n(But I didn't do anything wrong! ...At least, not that I can remember...)\nGumshoe:\nYou better make this right, pal. Now! And that means taking the case back to court. Got it?\nMaya:\nSounds like we've got our first case of the new year! Let's tackle it with gusto!\nPhoenix:\nI don't know... The judge already issued a guilty verdict once in this case. It's not going to be easy to get it overturned.\nMaya:\n... I guess that New Year's resolution is going to have to wait until next year.\nGumshoe:\nSo you're taking the case, right!? Good! I'm gonna head over to the courthouse then. After that, I'll go back to the precinct. Drop by if you need something, OK pal!?\nPhoenix:\n(I guess people are starting to know the name \"Phoenix Wright\". If a client entrusted a case to me based on my reputation... I guess I am kind of responsible. But why would someone want to impersonate me? What sort of a guy would do that?)\nJanuary 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept.\nMaya:\nIt's been ages since we came down to the precinct, huh, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nLooks like Gumshoe isn't around.\nMaya:\nHe's got it so easy, leaving everyone else to do the work!\nPhoenix:\nNo, he's been out there somewhere. My bet is on the courthouse. He's probably trying to arrange the retrial of this case.\nMaya:\nGuess that means we should go to the detention center and chat with our killer, huh?\nPhoenix:\nAfter being convicted without a fair trial, I'm not sure killer is the right label...\nJanuary 6Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nMaya:\nThis is so nerve-wracking, waiting to meet our new client. I wonder just what kind of person you tricked and got found guilty...?\nPhoenix:\nK-Keep it down, Maya! That kind of talk could ruin me!\n???:\nAaaaaaaah! How could you, Mr. Wright!? How could you do this to me!? They put me in solitary! I haven't been able to stop crying.\nPhoenix:\nA-Aren't... you...\n???:\nYes, I am! I am totally and utterly let down!\nMaya:\nAah! You're... Are you...?\n???\nDon't pretend you don't know me! It's me, Maggey, remember!? Maggey Byrde!\nPhoenix:\nMaggey Byrde... Ah! (Maggey Byrde... She's the policewoman I defended that one time. She was accused of murdering her lover. He was a cop, too.) What are you doing in here!? Didn't I get you acquitt--\nByrde:\nOh, sure! Very funny! After that fifth-rate defense job, you come in here and start making jokes!?\nMaya:\nYou better hurry up and tell her what happened, Nick.\nByrde:\nO-Oh... I see...\nPhoenix:\nSo that's where we stand right now.\nMaya:\nI'm sorry you've been caught up in another murder...\nByrde:\nMy whole life has been nothing but a whirlwind of bad luck and failures.\nPhoenix:\n(I vaguely remember her saying the exact same thing last time...)\nByrde:\nBut I don't mind! What's one more disaster in my life? At least now the real Mr. Wright is here with me. I won't let the world keep me down, sir!\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Magazine Clipping:\nByrde:\nMr. Wright... Do you think it's possible to get a retrial?\nPhoenix:\nProbably. The court ruled in the absence of a genuine defense attorney. So we should be able to get a retrial.\nByrde:\nUm... Mr. Wright...?\nPhoenix:\n?\nByrde:\nDo you think we'll win next time? ...Sir?\nPhoenix:\n...!\nByrde:\nMy life has been a full course meal of bad luck, complete with defeat for dessert. Since I was 6 months old, when I fell from the 9th floor of my apartment building... ...I've been hit by all sorts of vehicles, gotten sick from all sorts of foods... ...failed at almost every test I've taken, experienced almost every kind of disaster... I even landed a phony lawyer when I had the misfortune of being accused of murder. But! I will survive! Because Maggey Byrde always lives to fight another day! And one day, I'll find it! Just you wait and see, sir! I'll find that one, single moment of good luck!\nMaya:\nArgh, Xin Eohp is really gonna pay for this!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What are you staring at me like that for...? (But Maya's right... Whoever it is that thought it was a good idea to use my name... ...and get an innocent girl convicted of murder had better watch out!)\nMaya:\nWe'll find him! Don't you worry. We'll get Xin Eohp for you!\nByrde:\nThank you! Oh! I'll tell you where Trés Bien is then!\nPhoenix:\nTrés... Ah, right. The restaurant where the murder took place.\nByrde:\nYes, sir. When you go, please tell Mr. Armstrong I said hi!\nMaya:\nSure! Alright, Nick! Let's go check out this restaurant and its food!\nJanuary 6Trés Bien\nMaya:\nWow! Look at this place.\nPhoenix:\n\"Look\"? More like \"smell\"... What is with the suffocating scent of flowers in here...? Then again, girls like that sort of thing, right?\nMaya:\nActually, I'm not all that into it...\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\n... No one's coming to seat us. Maybe there's no one here.\nPhoenix:\nDon't be silly, Maya. This is a restaurant, and it's open for business. HELLO! ANYONE HERE? ... I don't believe it! There really isn't anyone here!\nMaya:\nPerfect! Let's get intrusive! If there's no one here, we can take anything we want!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, I suppose we can...)\nWright & Co. Law Offices\nDetention Center\nAfter presenting Sports Paper in Detention Center - Visitor's Room:\nJanuary 6Trés Bien\n???:\nOh là là! Bon-JOUR! Welcome to la Trés Bien!\nMaya:\nOh! Hel... lo... ...\nPhoenix:\n(What happened to Maya? She's frozen stiff...)\n???:\nBienvenue!

You are fatigued, non? Alors! You need z'is! An aromatic bath oil mélange of la néroli and la rose. My personal recommendation!\nMaya:\nYou think I need what...?\n???:\nOui, oui! Just add a couple of drops of z'is mixture to la bath water, and voilá! It will soothe your body and your mind. It's simply fantastique!\nMaya:\nReally?\n???:\nAnd for la monsieur!\nPhoenix:\nWho?

You are la Phoenix Wright, non?\nPhoenix:\nUm, yes... You know me?\n???:\nMais, oui oui! I never forget a man who flirts wiz me! Especially in court!\nMaya:\nI guess he was cross-examined by our mysterious Xin Eohp...\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like everyone to do with this case knows who \"I\" am already.\nMaya:\nI wonder what sort of impression Xin Eohp's been leaving on people, don't you?\nArmstrong:\nAllow me to introduce myself to you again. I am Jean Armstrong. Enchanté!\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\nUm, Mr. Armstrong... Could I just confirm something with you again? The table where the victim was sitting... Was anyone else sitting there?\nArmstrong:\n... Z'at is a question you will 'ave to ask 'im yourselves.\nMaya:\nHuh? \"'Im\"?\nArmstrong:\nLa old man spends all of 'is time dans la parc.\nPhoenix:\nLa p-parc? Oh, a park? What park's that?\nArmstrong:\nBehind la restaurant. It is called, \"Vitamin Square\".\nMaya:\nThank you!\nArmstrong:\nJe vous en prie, my dear!\nMaya:\nLet's go check out this Vitamin Square right now, Nick!\nJanuary 6Vitamin Square\nMaya:\nSo this is Vitamin Square.\nPhoenix:\nYeah. I see where they get the name from now. The fruits scream \"VITAMINS!\" at you.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! That's the guy, right? Isn't that the old man Mr. Armstrong was talking about?\nPhoenix:\nThat grouchy-looking grandpa?\nMaya:\nHe's throwing seeds out for the pigeons.\nPhoenix:\nMaya, he's not throwing seeds for them, he's throwing seeds AT them!\nOld Man:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh... My grumpiness-threat level has just been raised to red...)\nDetention Center\nTrés Bien\nVitamin Square\nAfter presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien:\nJanuary 6Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\nLooks like they have Maggey in questioning. I guess I've asked her pretty much everything... I'll come back if there's anything else I need to ask her later.\nAfter presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien:\nJanuary 6Wright & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nPoor Maya. It looks like Mr. Armstrong's really taken a shine to her. I suppose I'll just have to let her work at the restaurant for a while. I'll go pick her up from Trés Bien once things have cooled off.\nAfter presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien:\nJanuary 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept.\nGumshoe:\nWell, pal!? Have you found the evidence yet!? The one that's gonna find her innocent!?\nPhoenix:\nUm, no. Not yet. We've only just started our investigation.\nGumshoe:\nWell, whatever you need to know, I'll give you the dirt on it. I'm putting off all my other cases for now, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(Gumshoe's really fired up about this...)\nGumshoe:\nOh, yeah! One more thing! The retrial's been approved. Court's sitting at 10 AM tomorrow. And Godot's gonna be the prosecutor...\nPhoenix:\n(Oh. ... Him.)\nGumshoe:\nNow, listen up, pal! If Maggey's found guilty again...\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes...?\nGumshoe:\nUm... I'll... I'll make sure you get locked up good for it, got it!?\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Sports Paper in Police Station - Criminal Affairs Dept.:\nJanuary 6Trés Bien\nPhoenix:\nThe scent of flowers sure is strong. It's almost making me dizzy... Oh, um... Hello. (Who was that just now? A customer? She had sort of a dark aura about her...)\n???:\nAh! Welcome! Bee avenue!\nPhoenix:\n(Wow. What a cute voice.)\nMaya:\nOh, it's just you, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nM-Maya!\nMaya:\nWell? How do I look?\nPhoenix:\n... Maybe you should quit being a spirit medium...\nMaya:\nMaybe. But it's kind of boring being a waitress. I mean, you're my first ever customer.\nPhoenix:\n(Then who was that woman I just saw?)\nMaya:\nOh, oh! Since you're here, you might as well have something to eat!\nPhoenix:\n... I am kind of hungry, actually.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\nUm... About the lunch...\nMaya:\nOh! A fine choice, sir.\nPhoenix:\nNo. I, um...\nMaya:\nKITCHEN! A LUNCH SPECIAL, PLEASE! WITH ALL THE EXTRAS: DRINK, SIDE SALAD, DESSERT, AND GIFT!\nPhoenix:\nI don't need any of that!\nMaya:\nJust a moment, please, sir.\nPhoenix:\n(Maya's really getting into this! So how much is this set lunch, then? 20 dollars, huh? But with the drink, side salad, and dessert, it's... 45 dollars!?) Hey, wait a sec! Maya!\nMaya:\nSorry to keep you waiting, sir! Here you are, our deluxe Fortify lunch set!\nPhoenix:\nWhoa!\nMaya:\nA dish inspired by lobster and abalone fricassée with balsamic vinaigrette. Bon appétit!\nPhoenix:\nUm, thanks...?\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! Hurry up and try it already!\nPhoenix:\n(Lobster, huh? Alright... Down the hatch it goes...) ... Urp!\nMaya:\nWell?\nPhoenix:\nAre you hungry, Maya?\nMaya:\nI'm starving!\nPhoenix:\nHere. It's yours.\nMaya:\nReally!? ... Urp!\nPhoenix:\nRemember, Maya. My wallet doesn't print money, so you'd better polish off that plate!\nMaya:\n... I-I've just remembered! I've got to clean the toilets!\nPhoenix:\nHey! (You can't be in that much of a hurry to clean the toilets!)\nTrés Bien Lunch Special added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nHow does that guy manage to make good food taste so bad?\nMaya:\nHey, Nick... You want to take a peek at the kitchen?\nPhoenix:\n(The kitchen, huh? Not a bad idea.)\nAfter clearing \"Kitchen\" Talk option in Trés Bien:\nJanuary 6Trés BienKitchen\nMaya:\nAnd here it is! The famous Trés Bien kitchen! It's my first time in here too, actually.\nPhoenix:\n... There is a weird atmosphere in here, that's for sure.\nMaya:\nMr. Armstrong will be back soon, so we'd better search quickly! Chop, chop!\nAfter examining oil bottles in Trés Bien - Kitchen:\nJanuary 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept.\nGumshoe:\nHey, you're just in time!\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nThe lab got back to me about that newspaper you gave me.\nPhoenix:\n(He must mean this sports paper with the memo scribbled on it...) So? What did they say? Did the analysis turn up anything?\nGumshoe:\nThey said the doodle was written by the victim, Glen Elg. No doubt about it.\nPhoenix:\n(I expected as much...)\nGumshoe:\nThe victim took the paper with him to the restaurant on the day of the murder. That's our best interpretation of the facts at the moment.\nSports Paper refiled into the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\n\"MC Bomber\"... I get the feeling I've heard that name somewhere before... Oh, well. I guess it'll come back to me. Don't forget to report back to me with whatever you find in the restaurant, OK, pal?\nPhoenix:\n(Since when did I start taking orders from Gumshoe...? Although... I get the feeling there's something I need to show him...)\nAfter examining table in Trés Bien - Kitchen:\nJanuary 6Vitamin Square\nPhoenix:\nHmm, the old guy's not here anymore. (Drat. And I still have some unanswered questions for him.)\nPhoenix:\nA scooter, huh? Who'd leave it right in the middle of the park like this? The wheel guard and the light are busted... I guess it must have been in an accident. It's totally wrecked.\n???:\nGwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar!

He \"fed\" me as well. I got a bunch of those seeds in my eyes.\nMaya:\nOoh, ouch!\nPhoenix:\nHey, Maya. Would you mind coming with me for a while?\nMaya:\nHuh? Me? Why?\nPhoenix:\nThere's something I really want to ask that old man.\nMaya:\nSure, OK. I'll just get changed.\nPhoenix:\nNo, hang on! Can't you... go like that?\nMaya:\n...

I'm Victor. Victor Kudo.\nPhoenix:\n(Even from beyond the grave... Wow...)\nMia:\nWhatever did Mr. Armstrong do!?\nKudo:\nOh, no! Those eyes! I can't take this!\nPhoenix:\n(Mia's really got this guy eating out of her hand...)\nKudo:\nHe steals things. From his customers.\nPhoenix:\nFrom his customers?\nKudo:\nGloves, handkerchiefs... Little things, mainly. He's a pilferer! So you be careful around him, my dear.\nMia:\nAre you sure about this?\nKudo:\nOf course! He was arrested for it once. I was there when it happened, having my javaccino.\nPhoenix:\n(He really is a regular!)\nKudo:\nLet me write you a little haiku about it.\nPhoenix:\nA haiku?\nKudo:\nA Japanese poem. It'll explain all you need to know about that chef.\nVictor's Note added to the Court Record.\nKudo:\nIf he takes anything again, you let me know! If it's not too expensive, I'll buy you a replacement!\nPhoenix:\n(Poor guy. He couldn't do enough for Mia.)\nMia:\nOK, Phoenix. That's about as much as I can do to help.\nPhoenix:\nThanks, Mia. We got some really important information thanks to you.\nMia:\nHonestly! I can't believe Maya called me for something like this!\nCriminal Affairs Dept.\nAfter clearing \"Armstrong's secret\" Talk option in Police Station - Criminal Affairs Dept. and clearing \"Armstrong's record\" Talk option in Vitamin Square:\nJanuary 6Trés Bien\nMaya:\nI guess it's about time to wrap up today's investigation.\nPhoenix:\nHad enough of being a waitress?\nMaya:\nYeah. Plus, no one came to the restaurant...\nArmstrong:\nOh là là! Mademoiselle Maya! Non! 'Ow can you leave like z'is!?\nMaya:\nI-I'm sorry...\nPhoenix:\n(That reminds me. Mr. Armstrong had a Psyche-Lock or three, didn't he? I'm going to have to break those...) Mr. Armstrong. I hope you won't mind, but I'd like to have another word with you...\nArmstrong:\nVolontiers! Of course!\nArmstrong:\nI did not take it! La ticket for 'alf a million, I mean.\nMaya:\nBut you just told us you did! You said you took a ticket!\nArmstrong:\nMais non, ma fille! It was not...\n???:\nThat's enough.\nMaya:\nHuh? AAAAAAAAAH! Mr. Godot!\nPhoenix:\nWhat in the heck are you doing here!?\nGodot:\nUrgh! This is without doubt... the worst coffee I have ever tasted, Mr. Armstrong.\nPhoenix:\n(He came in here for coffee!? Does his craving for coffee know no bounds!?)\nGodot:\nPerhaps Mr. Armstrong stole one of the victim's tickets on the day in question.\nArmstrong:\nI am la air'ead, non? Just a pretty little girl who everyone is laughing at.\nMaya:\nBut, in that case, Maggey shouldn't be the only one under suspicion...\nGodot:\nHe had the wrong ticket.\nPhoenix:\n...What?\nGodot:\nMr. Armstrong made off with the winning ticket's pretty neighbor.\nMaya:\nSo... the ticket he took was worthless?\nGodot:\nNot quite. He did win something. A dollar.\nArmstrong:\nYou see! I am just a pretty face! W'izout my looks, I 'ave nothing!\nPhoenix:\nSo... What happened to the winning ticket, then? The one he meant to steal.\nGodot:\nIndeed. What did happen to it? I don't like spoiling myself by watching trailers, so... ...we'll just wait and see how the movie turns out tomorrow, won't we?\nMaya:\nNngh...\nArmstrong:\nVoilà! You two! Time to laugh at la pretty little air'ead!\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like I won't be needing this note anymore.)\nVictor's Note thrown into the trash.\nPhoenix:\nLooks like we've got a new mystery now. Namely, where did the winning ticket go?\nMaya:\nI've got a bad feeling about this.\nPhoenix:\nWell, anyway. We can't let Maggey suffer any longer for this. And certainly not again.\nTo be continued.\n\nJanuary 7, 9:48 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1\nByrde:\nOh... I see... I guess I should've expected this. Nobody saw the other guy, huh?

How're you feeling!?\nByrde:\n...As if you need to ask either question, sir.\nGumshoe:\nDon't let 'em get you down, Maggey. And don't forget to eat well, OK?\nByrde:\nRoger!\nGumshoe:\nAnd you!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes?\nGumshoe:\nYou'd better square this case away, got it pal!? Maggey's innocent, you hear!? If you screw up, then I'll be doing some squaring away myself. Squaring away some paperwork for your arrest!\nPhoenix:\n(I-I think he's serious!)\nMaya:\nHey, Detective! You're on our side for once, right?\nGumshoe:\nYup.\nMaya:\nSo you'll be able to help Maggey out, right?\nByrde:\nReally? Can you, sir!?\nGumshoe:\nO... Of course! I've got the simulation under control! I'm gonna be the first witness on the stand today. If something I say doesn't mesh with the facts, make sure you point it out, alright?\nPhoenix:\nS-Sure.\nGumshoe:\nOK. We're forming a united front today, pal. You get me!?\nByrde:\nI can't tell you how grateful I am, sir! I've always admired you so much, Detective. I know I can count on you.\nMaya:\nLooks like it should all go pretty smoothly today, huh?\nPhoenix:\n(I can only wish...)\nJanuary 7, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4\nJudge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Maggey Byrde.\nPhoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.\nGodot:\n... Aaah, bitter!\nJudge:\nMr... Um... Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nAaaah!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What's wrong!?\nJudge:\nNothing. It's just whenever I addressed you in the previous trial, your response was... \"Youse talkin' to me!?\" It was a little, well... intimidating.\nPhoenix:\nNo, no! That wasn't me. That was the phony Phoenix.\nJudge:\nI see. So our trusty Phoenix Wright is back with us now, is he?\nPhoenix:\n(\"Our trusty\"...?)\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Godot. Your opening statement, please.\nGodot:\nMr. Trite... Whether you're a fake or the real deal... We will find out soon enough through this trial today.\nPhoenix:\nBut I can already tell you! I'm the real Phoenix Wright!\nGodot:\nI wasn't questioning whether you are Phoenix Wright or not. I was questioning whether you had studied law or not. That's what I intend to find out.\nPhoenix:\n(There's no denying it. Behind that mask is a man who really hates me for some reason or another!)\nJudge:\nAs everyone is aware, the court has already given its verdict on this case once. Therefore, I won't stand for irrelevant testimony during this retrial. Nor will I stand for a simple repetition of the evidence presented in the last trial.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not planning on repeating anything that phony me said! Trust me!)\nJudge:\nNow then. Mr. Godot, please summon your first witness.\nGodot:\nLet's start with the formalities, shall we? Name and occupation?\nGumshoe:\n...\nJudge:\nWitness! State your name for the court!\nGumshoe:\nHuh? Oh, sorry, sir! The name's Police Department Detective. Occupation, Dick Gumshoe.\nGodot:\nOther way around, Detective.\nGumshoe:\nHuh? Oh! Sorry. Anyway, I'm the officer in charge of this case since yesterday. Sir!\nJudge:\nSince yesterday?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. The guy who was on the initial investigation's tied up with another case now.\nMaya:\nI hope Gumshoe's really got everything under control... For everyone's sake.\nJudge:\nI see. So, Detective Gumshoe... Would you outline for the court the basic facts of the case?\nGumshoe:\nY-Y-Yes, sir. The victim's name was Glen Elg. He was a professional programmer. He was on the payroll of Blue Screens Inc., a local company. This is the victim's autopsy report.\nJudge:\nThe court accepts this into evidence.\nGlen's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\nUm... And here are the floor plans of the restaurant. When the incident took place, the victim was sitting right here. The poisoned coffee was brought over to him by the, um... By the waitress.\nJudge:\nThe waitress being the accused?\nGumshoe:\nYeah... The victim died from poisoning almost immediately after he took a sip of the coffee. At the time of the incident, there were two other people in the restaurant. Mr. Jean Armstrong, the owner and chef. And a regular by the name of Mr. Victor Kudo.\nJudge:\nHmm... It still seems to be a very straightforward case to me.\nTrés Bien Floor Plans added to the Court Record.\nGodot:\nCome, Detective. Take up this hammer. And nail the defendant's coffin shut with your own two hands.\nJudge:\nNow then, Detective Gumshoe. Let's have your testimony.\nGumshoe:\nUmm... Yes, sir...\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Incident --\nGumshoe:\nWhen the incident took place, the victim was alone at his table, sir.\nWe understand that the guy, Glen Elg, was listening to the radio at the time.\nTraces of poison were found in his coffee cup.\nAnd what we found was potassium cyanide. That stuff really packs a punch!\nAnd, um... it looks like Ms. Byrde might've had, well... some kind of a motive.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nGodot:\nUsing the dark, aromatic depths of coffee to conceal the poison... Classy lady!\nJudge:\nThe facts of this case seem to be ironclad. Mr. Wright. I would ask you to begin your cross-examination, but...\nPhoenix:\nYes?\nJudge:\nPlease, no intimidation tricks this time around. Is that understood?\nPhoenix:\nI already told you! That wasn't me!\nCross Examination\n-- The Incident --\nGumshoe:\nWhen the incident took place, the victim was alone at his table, sir.\nGumshoe:\nWe understand that the guy, Glen Elg, was listening to the radio at the time.\nGumshoe:\nTraces of poison were found in his coffee cup.\nGumshoe:\nAnd what we found was potassium cyanide. That stuff really packs a punch!\nGumshoe:\nAnd, um... it looks like Ms. Byrde might've had, well... some kind of a motive.\nMaya:\nYou really think there are any contradictions in this testimony?\nPhoenix:\nTo be honest, I don't know.\nMaya:\nBut Gumshoe told us out in the lobby. He said we'd be forming a united front, right? How will we win the case if he doesn't throw us a line?\nPhoenix:\n(I don't have a whole lot of options right now... The best I can do is gather the facts together, I guess.)\nAfter selecting \"Press harder\" upon pressing first, third, and fifth statements:\nJudge:\nThat's enough! The facts of this case seem overwhelmingly clear to me. The defendant had ample opportunity to commit the crime of which she is charged. Furthermore, it seems beyond reasonable doubt that she did indeed commit this crime.\nGodot:\nI like an old man who knows the score.\nJudge:\nThere is also the matter of the half a million dollar lottery ticket. That alone provides a very credible motive. I mean, for that sum of money even I might be tempted to bend the rules!\nGodot:\nI don't mind an old man who is weak to the siren call of money.\nMaya:\nNot good, Nick... The evidence against Maggey is starting to pile up fast.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, that's because the court has ruled guilty once already.\nGodot:\nI'd say it's about time to wrap up this repeat performance... ...with one final, decisive piece of evidence.\nPhoenix:\n(He's got more evidence against Maggey!?)\nGodot:\nThis is the apron the delightful Ms. Byrde was wearing at the time.\nMaya:\nWow... That's not the cleanest apron I've seen...\nPhoenix:\nTh-That stain looks like...! (It can't be... blood, can it!?)\nGodot:\nHa...! It seems the star of our play was a little flustered... And somehow spilled coffee on herself.\nPhoenix:\nThe coffee!? That's not exactly the first thing that caught my eye...\nGodot:\nOf course. The coffee stain isn't the most interesting thing about this apron. No, there's something else that stands out even more.\nJudge:\nSomething else? I presume you mean...\nGodot:\nOf course. I'm referring to the pocket.\nPhoenix:\nThe... pocket?\nGodot:\nA search carried out right after the incident uncovered this... Potassium cyanide. The very poison used by the killer, was in her apron pocket!\nPhoenix:\nA bottle of poison... In Maggey's pocket?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. And Maggey's prints were the only ones on it.\nPhoenix:\nWHAAAT!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order! The court will accept these items into evidence.\nApron added to the Court Record.\nPotassium Cyanide added to the Court Record.\nJudge:\nThere's something still bothering me, Mr. Godot. Why have you not explained the bloodstain to the court?\nGodot:\nBloodstain? What bloodstain would that be?\nJudge:\nDon't play games, prosecutor! The blood-colored stain that's smeared all over the apron!\nGodot:\nThat's ridiculous! No one told me anything about a bloodstain!\nPhoenix:\n(You don't need to be told! Just look at it!)\nGodot:\nWell, Detective!? Could this stain really be... BLOOD!?\nGumshoe:\nN-No way, sir! That's... It's just ketchup. Sir.\nPhoenix:\nKetchup!?\nGumshoe:\nShe must've gotten some on her an apron while taking someone their breakfast that day.\nJudge:\n... You could have spoken up a little sooner, Detective Gumshoe!\nGodot:\nPull a stunt like that again, and I'll have you drink 17 cups of ketchup, witness!\nGumshoe:\nUnnngh... I thought everyone knew what it was already.\nJudge:\nHmm... I haven't seen anything yet to make me doubt the last verdict I ruled on this case.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nJudge:\nThe motive, the opportunity, and the supporting evidence... They have all been clearly established.\nGodot:\nWell, Trite... It seems you really are a phony after all.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh! You really know how to drive a man nuts!)\nJudge:\nWitness, please continue with your testimony. Describe for the court the crime scene and the findings of your investigation there.\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Investigation --\nGumshoe:\nThe crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.\nPoor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her.\nThe victim didn't have any identification on him.\nBut we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly.\nWhen Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison.\nAnd that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene.\nJudge:\nHmm... You identified the victim and secured your prime suspect... Very good.\nGodot:\nLast chance to convince the court you're a real lawyer, Trite!\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nDon't court on any more cross-examinations after this one! So, let the fun begin!\nCross Examination\n-- The Investigation --\nGumshoe:\nThe crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.\nGumshoe:\nPoor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her.\nGumshoe:\nThe victim didn't have any identification on him.\nGumshoe:\nBut we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly.\nGumshoe:\nWhen Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison.\nGumshoe:\nAnd that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene.\nPhoenix:\nIf I don't find a hole in this testimony, the judge is going to hand down his verdict!\nMaya:\nGumshoe isn't giving us anything to work with... And we can't find any contradictions if he doesn't give us something!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, that's true... But Maggey and Gumshoe are like dumb and dumber. Our only hope is that they were so dumb, they missed something obvious.\nMaya:\nCome on, Gumshoe! Be the dumbest you've ever been!\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe. I think I should point something out to you. There is just one small contradiction in your testimony.\nGumshoe:\nOho! Finally! I'm getting all anxious just waiting, so hurry up, will you?\nPhoenix:\nYou testified that, \"nothing else was missing from the crime scene.\" However! The prescription bag you mentioned was empty! Did the officers recover the medicine from the scene of the crime later?\nGumshoe:\nUm, no. They didn't.\nPhoenix:\nThe victim was given a prescription right before going to Trés Bien. Where, then, did the medicine disappear to!?\nGumshoe:\nY-You... ...are toooooo coool, pal!!\nJudge:\nI-Indeed! Due consideration wasn't given to the victim's prescription in the previous trial. Witness! Why do you always overlook such vital pieces of evidence!?\nGumshoe:\nI, er... I guess that's the most careless thing I've done so far, huh?\nPhoenix:\nThe victim was killed by poison! And the victim's \"medicine\" mysteriously disappeared! The victim's own prescription could have been the lethal poison itself!\nJudge:\nO-Order! Order! Well, Mr. Godot? What do you have to say to that?\nGodot:\nHa...! That's all.\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nGodot:\nRead for the court the name of the clinic on the prescription bag, if you will.\nPhoenix:\nWhat's the clinic's name got to do with anything...? \"New Ear Otolaryngological Clinic\" O-Otolaryngological?\nJudge:\nJust what kind of illness was the victim suffering from, Mr. Godot?\nGodot:\nHardly an illness, Your Honor. More like a bitter war wound, you could say.\nJudge:\nA war wound?\nGodot:\nThe day before the incident, Mr. Elg found himself in a fight. He took a blow to the side of the head, and ruptured his eardrum.\nPhoenix:\nHe ruptured his eardrum!?\nJudge:\nThen what on earth was the prescription he was given?\nGodot:\nIt was a cream that was to be applied topically inside his ear canal, not to be ingested!\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nGodot:\nIt's mentioned in the autopsy report, if you read the fine print. They found traces of the medication in the victim's left ear.\nJudge:\nYes. Here it is. In very, very fine print.\nGodot:\nIt seems Mr. Elg correctly applied some of his medication while he was at Trés Bien. Therefore, it would be absurd to believe that he would have eaten his medication.\nPhoenix:\nUuurgh...\nJudge:\nIt seems that this medication is irrelevant to the case after all.\nPhoenix:\nN-No...\nMaya:\nNick! If you don't think of something quick, it'll all be over!\nPhoenix:\n(She's right. But I can't get away with any old weak objection. What should I do...?)\nPhoenix:\nOnly moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement. \"It seems Mr. Elg correctly applied some of his medication while he was at Trés Bien.\" If that's the case, then why was the medication not found at the scene of the crime!?\nGodot:\n...!\nJudge:\nBut the medication in question was for topical use inside the ear canal!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThat doesn't change the fact that it could not be found at the crime scene! However insignificant it may seem, it's a lawyer's duty to pursue the truth!\nGodot:\nGodot:\nYou know as well as I do that the medication is irrelevant. It hardly seems likely that a prescription drug would contain potassium cyanide.\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nIt hardly seems likely that the coffee the waitress served would contain it, either! But it did! The possibility is undeniable!\nGodot:\nAaargh!\nJudge:\nThat's enough. Mr. Godot. Is the detective the only witness the prosecution wishes to call?\nGodot:\n...\nJudge:\nMr. Godot...?\nGodot:\n...\nGumshoe:\nUm... I, ah... I've got my own witness I'd like to call, sir. It's the old man who was there in the restaurant on the day of the murder.\nPhoenix:\n(Victor Kudo? The pigeon-hater?)\nJudge:\nVery well. The matter of the disappearing medication seems little more than trivial at best. However! It wasn't explored at all in the previous trial. And that is something that bothers me.\nMaya:\nYay! Good job, Nick!\nJudge:\nThe court will adjourn for a 10 minute recess. After which we will hear the prosecution's next witness.\nGodot:\nHa...! I suppose this means I'll just have to finish you off in my last 6 cups.\nJudge:\nCourt is adjourned for recess!\nJanuary 7, 11:03 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1\nMaya:\nPhew! That was close!\nPhoenix:\nTell me about it... I nearly died in there!\nByrde:\nThat's my line, sir!\nMaya:\nNo! It's my line! I think I really did die a little bit.\nByrde:\nLooks like we all nearly died in there... I can't believe Detective Gumshoe! How could he betray us like that!?\nMaya:\nHuh?\nByrde:\nHe said he'd help me. But he totally set me up!\nPhoenix:\nI don't think he meant to do that, Maggey. He was backed into a corner. I mean, the guy's got to do his job, right?\nByrde:\nIt's OK. I know all about lies and betrayal. I've had them my whole life. But it really hurt this time. It felt like someone punched me hard in the stomach! I hate that guy! I don't ever want to see him again!\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Gumshoe...)\nMaya:\nSo the next witness is going to be that old guy from the park, right?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. Mr. Kudo. Lover of waitress outfits and projectile seeds!\nByrde:\nI bet he's gonna be really stubborn. I mean, he's pretty set in his ways, you know?\nMaya:\nYeah, he's a big old grouch. Are you going to be able to handle him, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I can take whatever he throws at me. Even those never-ending bird seeds!\nJanuary 7, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4\nJudge:\nCourt will now reconvene for the trial of Maggey Byrde. Mr. Godot. Your next witness, please.\nGodot:\nThe prosecution calls the lucky old-timer who caught the show over a cup of coffee. Will the witness please take the stand.\nGodot:\nName and occupation, if you don't mind.\nKudo:\nThe name is Victor Kudo. Born and bred in the Land of the Rising Sun! Honor and duty are what make me. Mind you, I can be quite emotional at times, too.\nPhoenix:\nWe don't need to hear about that, Mr. Kudo. Just tell the court your occupation.\nKudo:\nMy occupation? Kah! Listen, young'un! How much call d'you think there is for kimono embroidery here!?\nPhoenix:\nKimono embroidery?\nKudo:\nThat's what I do! Or did, back in Japan. I embroidered family crests on kimonos! My ancestors were embroidering kimonos before this country even existed!\nMaya:\nWow, a real craftsman! They're a dying breed! Hey! Maybe he could embroider my costume sometime.\nKudo:\nAnyway, like I said. There's not much demand for that kind of thing here. So I had to take a job working the cash register at a burger joint... pretending to smile!\nPhoenix:\n(That burger joint would've been better off putting him in the kitchen...)\nJudge:\nNow then, witness. Were you in the restaurant at the time of the incident?\nKudo:\nOh, yes! I was eating some seeds over a cup of javaccino.\nJudge:\nSeeds?\nKudo:\nWhat do you think these are, hmm!?\nJudge:\nI-I see...\nGodot:\nSo you saw everything that happened, gramps?\nKudo:\nDid I!? Oh, yes! Oh, yes I did! I saw it all!\nGodot:\nThen please, tell the court. We're all ears.\nKudo:\nSure, sure. I'll tell you. I'll tell you every last detail!\nPhoenix:\n(He's really getting into this...)\nWitness Testimony\n-- What I Witnessed --\nKudo:\nThe young man was reading the sports paper.\nThe serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it!\nThe man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed.\nThat's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well!\nJudge:\nMr. Kudo. she is not a \"serving girl\". Please refer to her as a waitress.\nKudo:\nKah! You're as bad as the rest of them! All these newfangled words! What's wrong with old-fashioned ones, hmm!?\nJudge:\nN-Newfangled?\nKudo:\nAll this talk of \"radios\" and \"glasses\"! It's \"wireless\" and \"spectacles\", I tell you!\nJudge:\nE-Excuse me...\nKudo:\nListen to me, everyone! Don't forget the old values! Don't let the good old days slip away!\nJudge:\nWell, um... I think it's time to begin the cross-examination, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor.\nCross Examination\n-- What I Witnessed --\nKudo:\nThe young man was reading the sports paper.\nKudo:\nThe serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it!\nKudo:\nThere's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there.\nKudo:\nThe man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed.\nKudo:\nThat's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well!\nKudo:\nThere was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose.\nKudo:\nThere wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front.\nMaya:\nDo you think Old Seedy really saw Maggey do it?\nPhoenix:\nWell, he probably had his eye on the waitress the whole time. That's why he was there.\nMaya:\nBut he was there for the cute outfits, right? Not the waitress...\nPhoenix:\nI-I guess... (Hmm, she makes a good point though...)\nMaya:\nHey! Did I just say something clever?\nPhoenix:\nI wonder if the waitress Mr. Kudo saw really was Maggey...\nMaya:\nThat's what we have to figure out, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nMr. Kudo. I would like you to please take a look at this.\nKudo:\nKah! That filthy thing would suit filth like you just perfectly. Actually, it reminds me of what my grandson looks like, just after he's done eating.\nPhoenix:\nHave you ever seen this before?\nKudo:\nOf course I haven't! Do you think I'd forget something as dirty as that!? Hmm? Well? You half-witted clot!?\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\n...\n.........\nKudo:\nWh-What!? What is it!? Ever since I said, \"you half-witted clot\", there's been an eerie silence in here.\nPhoenix:\nMr. Kudo. This apron... ...is the apron worn by the defendant on the day of the poisoning!\nKudo:\nUh?\nPhoenix:\nAnd as you just said yourself... ...you wouldn't forget something like this. Which means, is you had really seen this apron before...\nKudo:\nEr...\nPhoenix:\nYes, you know what I'm getting at! You couldn't have possibly seen the waitress from the front!\nKudo:\n... Oops!\nJudge:\nWitness! You can't just \"oops\" your way out of this!\nGodot:\nHa...! Well, well... Looks like we finally have a genuine trial on our hands.\nPhoenix:\n...\nGodot:\nListen, Trite. Here are the facts. On the day of the incident, there was only one waitress in the restaurant.\nJudge:\nThat being the defendant, Ms. Maggey Byrde?\nGodot:\nExactly. And when that one waitress put the poison into the coffee cup... ...this old guy was watching!\nJudge:\nHmm... I hope you understand the gravity of the situation, Mr. Kudo. The fate of the defendant may rest on what you say you remember seeing.\nGodot:\nJust tell the court exactly what you saw, gramps.\nKudo:\nYou can rely on me, Captain! My noggin's in perfect working order. I can't remember a single occasion when I forgot what burger a customer wanted!\nMaya:\nHe can't remember? Probably more like he messes up so many times, he's blocking it out...\nJudge:\nVery well. Let's test just how good your memory and attention to detail is, Mr. Kudo. Tell us what you remember about the victim.\nWitness Testimony\n-- About the Victim --\nKudo:\nHe was another of those pesky young types, wearing a broken pair of spectacles.\nHe had a newspaper in his right hand, and the noisy brat kept rustling its pages!\nThe young man was listening to the wireless. I remember that well.\nThen the serving girl in question brought over the javaccino.\nThe little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip.\nJudge:\nThe testimony we have just heard was to test how credible the witness's memory is. It seems to me that he remembers the victim in a great deal of detail.\nKudo:\nOh, yes! I hate those you-know-what types who are so vague about everything!\nMaya:\nHow are we going to handle this, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nWe only need to do one thing. We just need to prove that the old man's memory is shot.\nMaya:\nJust trip him up, you mean? Isn't that kind of cruel?\nPhoenix:\n(I suppose... But it's what I do best.)\nCross Examination\n-- About the Victim --\nKudo:\nHe was another of those pesky young types, wearing a broken pair of spectacles.\nKudo:\nHe had a newspaper in his right hand, and the noisy brat kept rustling its pages!\nKudo:\nThe young man was listening to the wireless. I remember that well.\nKudo:\nThen the serving girl in question brought over the javaccino.\nKudo:\nThe little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip.\nPhoenix:\n(The whole point of this cross-examination is to establish just one thing... That this old guy's memory has more holes than a slice of Swiss.)\nMaya:\nI guess we just need to find a contradiction in his testimony somewhere, huh?\nPhoenix:\n(Anything will do. Even the smallest detail. We just need one mistake, and he's ours!)\nPhoenix:\nMr. Kudo. Do you remember what you were told at the start of this testimony? That this was a way of testing the credibility of your memory?\nKudo:\nI know, I know! There's nothing wrong with my memory, I tell you! Nothing! If I got anything wrong, I'll eat these seeds and sing the pigeon song!\nGodot:\nCare to tell us where this is going, Trite?\nPhoenix:\nAccording to Mr. Kudo, the victim was holding the paper in his right hand... ...while drinking coffee with his free hand, which would make that his left.\nKudo:\nKah! What is this? Kindergarten?\nPhoenix:\nBut I would like the court to please take a look at this.\nJudge:\nThat's the cup victim used, correct?\nPhoenix:\nYes, and on the rim, you'll notice the mark left by the victim's lips.\nJudge:\nYes. There is a stain left by the coffee.\nPhoenix:\nIf you consider where that stain is, you'll clearly see... ...that the victim was holding the cup in his right hand!\nKudo:\nBut how...?\nPhoenix:\nWell, Mr. Kudo. The court is waiting for your epic performance! You said you'd eat those seeds and sing the pigeon song!\nKudo:\nAaaargh!\nJudge:\nMr. Kudo... I'm afraid this is simply not acceptable. I think the witness had better go back to the park where he came from.\nKudo:\nWAAAAIT! If you think I'm going to stand here and listen to you tell me I'm mad, you're wrong! I don't care about that dirty coffee cup! I know what I saw!\nJudge:\nY-You still insist on your testimony?\nKudo:\nThat young brat was holding the cup in his left hand! Oh, yes. No question! I'm a good, law-abiding citizen, I am. It's that dead young hotbot and you, you spikey-haired yahoo, who are at fault!\nPhoenix:\n(Who, me!?)\nJudge:\nTh-Thank you, old man. We've heard quite enough from you already.\nKudo:\nDon't call me \"old man\", old man! Been around for 68 years, I have. You can't ignore me! LISTEN TO WHAT I'VE GOT TO SAAAAY!\nJudge:\nI'm sorry, Mr. Kudo, but...\nGodot:\nSure, why not hear a little more?\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Godot!\nGodot:\nBut this is my 16th cup of coffee... So this is your final stand.\nKudo:\nThank you, Captain! You can rely on Victor!\nWitness Testimony\n-- Left Hand or Right Hand --\nKudo:\nThe boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs.\nHe kept fiddling with it all the time.\nHe was fiddling with it just before he picked up the cup, too.\nAnd then he used the same hand to pick up the cup. His left hand!\nJudge:\nWe know that the victim was wearing an unusual monocle over his left eye.\nGodot:\nIt wasn't a monocle, Your Honor. It was a small computer monitor often used by programmers.\nJudge:\nA monitor? You mean, like a television screen!?\nGodot:\nThe inside of the lens is a screen that displays computer data. It's called an HMD. It's a common tool in the victim's line of work.\nKudo:\nHDTV, DVD, CD... All these newfangled letters drive me mad! But they don't matter. I know what I saw, and I'm telling the truth!\nPhoenix:\n(It's true... He doesn't seem to be lying.)\nKudo:\nAnd those are the facts, in good old black and white!\nCross Examination\n-- Left Hand or Right Hand --\nKudo:\nThe boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs.\nKudo:\nHe kept fiddling with it all the time.\nKudo:\nHe was fiddling with it just before he picked up the cup, too.\nKudo:\nAnd then he used the same hand to pick up the cup. His left hand!\nMaya:\nWell, Nick? What do you think?\nPhoenix:\nI think the guy's telling the truth. But even so... Something's not quite right.\nMaya:\nThen chuck evidence at him until he breaks!\nPhoenix:\n(But if he's not lying, there wouldn't be any contradictions in his testimony, right?)\nPhoenix:\nI'm not sure what the relevance of this is, but... Mr. Kudo! There is something very strange about your observations of the victim.\nKudo:\nWhat!?\nPhoenix:\nYou say he was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the HMD.\nKudo:\nNo question! You can lock me up if I'm wrong! It was his left ear, without a doubt! I could only see that side of his head from where I was sitting.\nPhoenix:\nI don't think so.\nKudo:\nWh-What did you say!?\nPhoenix:\nYou're no doubt unaware of this fact, Mr. Kudo. But the victim couldn't hear with his left ear! His eardrum was ruptured!\nKudo:\nEh?\nPhoenix:\nTraces of medication for his condition were found in his ear canal. That's right! It's impossible that the victim was wearing his earpiece in his left ear. Because he couldn't even hear in that ear!\nKudo:\n... Is that true, Captain?\nGodot:\n...It is.\nKudo:\n...Pi... Pi-Pi-Pigeon! Hm-hm-hmm... Pretty pigeon! Hm-hm-hmm...\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order!\nPhoenix:\nThis witness's testimony is completely unreliable! He only saw the witness from behind. And he claims the victim was wearing an earpiece when we know his eardrum was ruptured! Well, Mr. Godot!?\nGodot:\nAaaargh! A single drop of milk is all it takes to destroy the pure black magic in the cup! The old man... ...is my drop of milk!\nKudo:\nCaptain! Are you calling me a drip!?\nJudge:\nThis is the victim's coffee cup in which the potassium cyanide was found. The mark on the rim clearly shows that the victim picked it up with his right hand!\nKudo:\nI'll never back down! I know I'm right! The lad drank his javaccino with his left hand!\nGodot:\nLet me put you out of your misery... Clearly, the victim used both hands. He took a sip with the cup held in his right hand, and then switched to his left... That's what the old man saw!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nImpossible! The witness has already testified on numerous occasions... ...that the victim died immediately after taking just one sip of the coffee.\nGodot:\nGodot:\nWhich hand the victim used to pick up his cup is irrelevant, Your Honor. The facts still stand! With one hand or the other, Mr. Elg drank the poisoned coffee... ...Like this!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSadly, Mr. Godot, that doesn't wash! The point of this testimony was to establish whether the witness's memory was credible. And the results are clear! The testimony given by this witness is useless!\nGodot:\nPuuuurgh!\nJudge:\nI believe it is time to conclude today's proceedings. I am satisfied that the witness is not deceiving the court. But to be frank, his testimony is a farce!\nKudo:\nD-Did you have to be so frank!? Take that, you pompous old fogey!\nJudge:\nI'm sorry, Mr. Kudo. You can't reach me from there. I'm ordering the defense and the prosecution to investigate this case further. That is all for now. This court is adjourned!\n???:\nKudo:\nWAAAAIT! If we stop now, where does that leave me?\nJudge:\nLeave you, Mr. Kudo?\nKudo:\nThanks to that blue-suited young upstart over there... ...I'm just a bumbling old man who can't even dot his t's or cross his i's now!\nPhoenix:\n(How is your bad memory my fault!?)\nJudge:\nI'm sorry, Mr. Kudo, but there's nothing I can do.\nKudo:\nI've kept my mouth shut until now... ...but there's something else the court should know!\nGodot:\nWhat!?\nPhoenix:\nThere's more?\nKudo:\nTo be perfectly honest, it might not be anything. But I want another chance! I want another crack at you, you young shark!\nPhoenix:\nM-Me? (He's looking at me like I'm some sort of evil Shogun...)\nKudo:\nWell, everyone? What do you say to one final showdown? The final chapter in this eccentric old man's scrapbook!\nGodot:\nSorry, gramps... I've already had my 17th cup of coffee.\nKudo:\nWhat have you got to lose, Captain? I'll give you all the javaccino you want if you come to my house after the trial. (Changed from [I'll give you all the coffee you want if you come to my house after the trial.] in the original release) I may be 68 years old, but Victor Kudo is still a man!\nJudge:\nThat's enough, witness. I believe it will be quicker for the court to just hear your testimony.\nKudo:\nYou bet! Much, much quicker!\nMaya:\nI can't believe this is happening...\nKudo:\nHa ha ha! You better get ready, youngster!\nPhoenix:\nI get the picture! Just quit throwing those seeds at me, would you!? (He's gotta be using some sort of infinite ammo code with that box of seeds...)\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Final Showdown --\nKudo:\nFirst of all, I want to stress that this might be nothing. I'm not too sure of myself.\nThe young boy slumped over the table as soon as he took one sip of his javaccino...\nWell, the clumsy idiot upset the vase. He knocked it right over.\nIt broke, and the strip of cloth covering the table got completely soaked!\nWell!? How about that? Turned things upside-down, hmm?\nJudge:\n... Um... Is that all?\nKudo:\nYes, that's all. I remember it perfectly. Eh!? You're doubting me again? You're doubting a poor, defenseless old man!?\nJudge:\nN-No. We are not doubting you, Mr. Kudo.\nMaya:\nDon't you get the feeling there's a question hanging on everyone's lips, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. \"So what?\" probably! That's all I can think of, and I have to cross-examine this guy!\nKudo:\nYou're a birdbrain, that's why that's all you can think of!\nJudge:\nVery well... Mr. Wright. Your final cross-examination, please.\nCross Examination\n-- The Final Showdown --\nKudo:\nFirst of all, I want to stress that this might be nothing. I'm not too sure of myself.\nKudo:\nThe young boy slumped over the table as soon as he took one sip of his javaccino...\nKudo:\nWell, the clumsy idiot upset the vase. He knocked it right over.\nKudo:\nIt broke, and the strip of cloth covering the table got completely soaked!\nKudo:\nWell!? How about that? Turned things upside-down, hmm?\nPhoenix:\nHe's really giving you the evil eye, Maya.\nMaya:\nIt's you he's looking at, Nick, not me! It's like he's saying, \"I triple dog dare you to find a contradiction, young'un!\"\nPhoenix:\nI guess I'll just have to rise to the challenge then...\nPhoenix:\nMr. Kudo. This is a photograph of the crime scene.\nKudo:\nHmph! So what?\nPhoenix:\nLook carefully at the table. The vase is there... intact!\nKudo:\nHuh?\nPhoenix:\nLost your tongue, granddad?\nKudo:\n... I'm no granddad of yours, hop scotch!\nPhoenix:\nOw! Oooow!\nJudge:\nEnough! If you throw any more seeds in this courtroom, the cleaners will be here all night.\nKudo:\nAaaaaah!\nJudge:\n... What is it now?\nKudo:\nI just remembered something!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes...? Go on...\nKudo:\nThe broken vase... Ha ha! It was on my table!\nPhoenix:\nWha...?\nKudo:\nAh, well... You see... It startled me when that young lad collapsed. So I stood up. That must've been when it fell over. The vase on my table, I mean.\nJudge:\nThe vase on your table?\nKudo:\nAh ha ha! Yes, it was on my table! And that's how my groin came to be completely soaked.\n.........\nJudge:\n*sigh* Thank you, Mr. Kudo. You've certainly earned your kudos for today.\nKudo:\nEr, I'd like to ask a question now. Have I, er... Have I been any use at all?\nJudge:\nPerhaps that's something you should reflect on yourself, Mr. Kudo.\nKudo:\nAaaargh! WAIT! WAIT A MINUTE! If that's the case, there's more! I've got more to say! Oh, yes! I remember something else...\nJudge:\nBailiff! Escort the witness out of the courtroom!\nKudo:\nWAAAIT! LISTEN TO MEEEEEE!\nJudge:\nWell! We seem to have been considerably sidetracked. And I am still not in a position to deliver a verdict.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nJudge:\nThe defendant has not been positively identified as the waitress in question. Additionally, there are two disparities in the testimony we have heard thus far.\nPhoenix:\nThe mark on the coffee cup that the victim supposedly drank from with his left hand. And the earpiece which was inserted into his left ear, out of which he couldn't hear.\nMaya:\nWow, Nick! You did it!\nJudge:\nI therefore require both the defense and the prosecution to further investigate the facts.\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.\nGodot:\n...\nJudge:\nThere is one more thing before I call today's session to an end.\nPhoenix:\nO-One more thing, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nThe witness we just heard from... He is most insistent that his testimony should be of use. So he's summarized it accordingly into this statement.\nPhoenix:\nUm... OK...\nJudge:\nYou may each have a copy of it, if you wish.\nGodot:\nWhatever. The prosecution doesn't need props like that.\nMaya:\nGodot's really mad, huh?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. I would be, too.\nJudge:\nVery well. Here you are then, Mr. Wright. There are 3 copies. My own, yours, and Mr. Godot's.\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.\nVictor's Testimony added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\n(\"I'm sorry\"? This isn't a piece of testimony! More like a five year old's apology...)\nMaya:\nWhat the heck are we supposed to do with 3 copies...?\nJudge:\nThat is all. This court is adjourned!\nTo be continued."

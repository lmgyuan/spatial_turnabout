Will it be last year's runner-up, Jammin' Ninja!? Or maybe Captain Saipan all the way from the lovely tropical island of Saipan!? I see the students of a certain Starry School are raring to win! And Global Hero Onyankopon doesn't want to go home without the prize! We hope Lady Luck is with all our heroes tonight! And now! The winner of the third annual Hero of Heroes Grand Prix... IS ME!!\nWhoooooooooa! The true hero of the night has appeared in our midst! It looks like this year's Grand Prix goes to this fantastic warrior! The Nickel Samurai! Too bad, Jammin' Ninja. Looks like the title eluded you again this year!\nMarch 20, 7:42 PMGatewater HotelViola Hall\nMaya:\nAlright! Yes! Did you hear that, Nick!? Did you!? The Nickel Samurai! He did it!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, he sure did... *sigh* I'm getting too old for this.\nPowers:\nAh, I'm proud of the guy for doing the series justice.\nPearl:\nU-Um... So the person everyone was cheering for... I guess he got the prize?\nMaya:\nYup! You know who we're talking about, right Pearly? \"The Nickel Samurai\"!\nPearl:\nNo. Every Sunday, I only watch the Educational Channel's \"Kids' Masterpiece Theatre\".\nMaya:\nOK, that's it! From now on, it's \"The Nickel Samurai\"! All the kids watch it!\nPearl:\nDo you like \"The Nickel Samurai\" too, Mr. Nick?\nMaya:\nNah, Nick's an old fart, so he's not allowed to watch it anymore.\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. But I do like \"Kids' Masterpiece Theatre\".\nMaya:\nHey, I didn't know you were so young at heart, Nick!\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! You're a grown-up! You're not allowed to watch it anymore! You're supposed to act your age and have interests that match. ...It's very important.\nMaya:\nAw, give it a rest, Pearly!\nPowers:\nLooks like I made the right choice in inviting everyone here. I'm glad you're all having a good time.\nMaya:\nAaaaah... It's like a dream!\nPowers:\nToo bad for the Jammin' Ninja, though. Last year, he lost to The Pink Princess: Warrior of Little Olde Tokyo. I thought this might be his year...\nMaya:\nYeah... Oh, hey, did anyone else think that the Jammin' Ninja was a bit different today?\nPearl:\nDifferent? What do you mean?\nMaya:\nUm, well, he wasn't carrying his bright red guitar.\nPowers:\nHey, you're right! Strange he'd walk around without his signature guitar.\nPhoenix:\n(...*sigh* I will never understand these people and their shows...) Anyway, Mr. Powers, thank you very much for tonight.\nPowers:\nA-Aw, it was nothing... I owe you one, so it's just my way of saying thanks.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Come on! It's time to get going to the lobby! There's a post-ceremony stage show that's supposed to start real soon.\nPowers:\nAnd then, I heard there's going to be a press conference after that.\nPhoenix:\nA press conference? Is he going to make a speech about winning this year's prize?\nPowers:\nUh, well, not exactly... Something about the Nickel Samurai confessing something.\nPhoenix:\nConfessing...? Sounds pretty serious.\nMaya:\nArgh! Nick! COME ON! You don't want us to be the last ones there, do you!?\nPearl:\nYeah, Mr. Nick! Do you!?\nPhoenix:\n(Why me...? The show doesn't even start for another 20 minutes...)\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHallway\nPhoenix:\nWow, what is with this place? Looks like I've stumbled into Oz or something. Way in the back, there's a sign for the bathroom. Maybe I should visit it while I can before the show starts... (Changed from [I bet we have a little time to look around before the show starts...] in the original release)\nViola Hall (after clearing all Talk options in Gatewater Hotel - Viola Hall and visiting Hallway)\nPowers:\nSounds like the post-ceremony show is about to start.\nMaya:\nAlright! I'm so pumped! I wonder if he's going to show off his special move today? \"Nickel Samurai Smelting!\"\nPowers:\nActually, what I'm interested in most is the press conference.\nMaya:\nYou mean the \"big confession\" the Nickel Samurai's going to make after the show? So what is it? Don't you know what it's about, Mr. Powers?\nPowers:\nUh, well, I'm not the Steel Samurai anymore, so I don't have any idea.\nMaya:\nBah.\nPowers:\nS-Sorry. Ah, so I guess you are all going to the press conference then?\nMaya:\nYeah, of course!\nPowers:\nIf that's the case, then here, take these tickets so you can get in.\nPress Conference Ticket added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nThank you very much. Well, let's get going to the lobby.\nPearl:\nIt looks like it's over this way, Mr. Nick!\nMaya:\nOK! For great justice!\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Only a really gaudy hotel would have such a large, gaudy lobby to match.\nPearl:\nAh, I think they're going to have the post-ceremony show over there.\nPhoenix:\nThey're using a compact stage, I see.\nMaya:\nOoh... I'm all ready to use my special \"Samurai Power\".\nPhoenix:\n(Maya looks like she's ready to start a fight...)\nPA Notice:\nYour attention please, your attention please. The Nickel Samurai's Post-Ceremony Stage Show will not be held tonight due to unforeseen circumstances.\nMaya:\nWHAAAT!? WHYYYYY!?\nPhoenix:\nOww! You didn't have to pinch me! Pinch yourself if you don't believe it!\nPA Notice:\nWe are asking for everyone's cooperation at this time. So please stay where you are. ...This is a special request from the police.\nPearl:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nP-Police? Did they just say the police?\nPowers:\nD-Do you want me to go check out what's going on?\nPhoenix:\nUm, wait, I'll come with you...\n???:\nFreeze! You two! Didn't you hear the announcement just now!? It just finished telling you not to move!\nMaya:\nTh-That voice... I've heard that voice somewhere before...\n???:\nHonestly, youth these days can't be bothered to listen to other people when they talk! Just the other day it was the same thing! There was a small footbridge with a sign next to it that said, \"Beware, Bridge Out!\" And along comes a snot-nosed little punk kid right up to the bridge. I tried to tell the boy the bridge was out and it was dangerous, but would he listen!? No, of course not! He said he'd be careful and only walk on the \"in\" part of the bridge since the \"out\" part is what was dangerous! I am not kidding you here! The kid said that and really meant it! WELL! I really let him have it then, and knocked him clear off of that bridge! Honestly, kids these days don't know right from wrong, I tell you!\nPowers:\nThis non-stop chatter...\nPhoenix:\nI-It can't be... ...Ms. Oldbag?\n???:\n...\nOldbag:\nWhat is it, you young whipper-snappers!? Do I know you!? ...Wait. YOU! You're Powers, aren't you!?\nPowers:\nY-Yeah. Um, about what happened back then...\nOldbag:\nYou didn't even get nominated this year, did you? (Changed from [You didn't get nominated last year either, did you?] in the original release) Oh, that's right. You're doing that children's exercise program, trying to play nice.\nPowers:\nAh, yeah, that's me. Thankfully I still have a job...\nOldbag:\nI love that show, and you're a hoot! You're the \"big brother\" character, right? Yes, even with your face covered by a mask, I know. You're that giant rabbit! (Changed from [Yes, even with your face covered by a mask, I know. You ended up with a rabbit face.] in the original release) What a work of art, but that's how it is, you know? I mean, if you didn't wear the mask, who knows how many TVs you'd break? Really, and shame on those kids exercising around you. They're getting what they deserve. This is why I thought you shouldn't be anywhere...\nPhoenix:\nUm... What are you doing here?\nOldbag:\nLook at my uniform and tell me you can't tell I'm a member of security!\nMaya:\nBut that outfit...\nOldbag:\nAnnoying, noisy brats get the blaster!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nMaya:\n...Hey, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What is it? I don't like that devilish smile playing on your lips...\nMaya:\nLet's make like we're going to the bathroom, and check things out!\nPhoenix:\nN-No way. The police told us not go [sic] anywhere, remember?\nMaya:\nHuh!? How B-O-R-I-N-G! You're such a boring guy! You've got no motivation! No spirit!\nPearl:\nHuh? What? What's going on? Are you giving Mystic Maya trouble again, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Not you too, Pearls... Please don't stick your little nose into this one...)\nMaya:\nSo listen to this, Pearly. This one time at lawyer camp, Nick...\nPhoenix:\nO-OK! I get it! Let's go take a look.\nMaya:\nYay! I know you couldn't say no to me, Nick!\nPearl:\nThat's right. You'd walk over miles of hot coals for Mystic Maya, wouldn't you Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(That would be EVERY time we work a case together...)\nMaya:\nWell, what are we waiting for? Let's go already! You can come along too, Pearly.\nPearl:\nGoody! I get to come! I get to come!\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelViola Hall\nPhoenix:\nThere's nothing really out of the ordinary here...\nPearl:\nAre you looking for the \"in-si-dent\" that the old lady was talking about? (Changed from [Are you looking for the 'something' that the old lady was talking about?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nDoesn't look like it happened here. Well, we'd better go look somewhere else.\nMaya:\nAlright! Then, let's try...\nBellboy:\nExcuse me.\nMaya:\nAck!\nBellboy:\nAre you by chance, Ms. Maya Fey?\nMaya:\nUm, yeah... That's me.\nBellboy:\nYou have a phone call waiting for you at the front desk.\nMaya:\nA call? I wonder if it's someone from Kurain Village...\nPearl:\nWhat's wrong, Mystic Maya?\nMaya:\nOh, nothing. You guys go on ahead and I'll be right there, OK? (Changed from [Oh, nothing. I'll just go on ahead to check it out, OK?] in the original release)\nPearl:\nOK.\nBellboy:\nRight this way, Ms. Fey.\nPearl:\nLet's go look somewhere else now, Mr. Nick.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, OK.\nPearl:\nThis is a little exciting... And a little scary...\nHotel Lobby\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHallway\nI. TOLD. YOU. I get people the info they want! Which means that I've got a right to know!\nNope! Don't care who you are, pal, we're still investigating, so you can't go in!\nWhat's yer problem!? Just ya wait! It'll be all over the morning paper! \"Scruffy Detective's Secret Scandal Revealed!\" You'll see! I'll git ya back!\nPearl:\nThose two sound pretty serious...\nPhoenix:\n(That southern accent can only mean...)\nHey, Wright!\nPhoenix:\nH-Hey... Lotta...\nLotta:\nCome on, do a gal a favor and tell this cop I'm just doin' my job and I've got rights...\nGumshoe:\nAh, YOU!\nPhoenix:\nAh... Detective Gumshoe...\nGumshoe:\nHey pal, help a guy out! Tell her that only the police are allowed here! This is the scene of a murder, so she should leave this to us pros...\nPearl:\nA... A murder!?\nGumshoe:\nAw, shoot! Me and my big mouth!\nLotta:\nSee! I knew it! My gut instinct told me so! I always trust my gut! A murder, it said! And that's what it is! A genuine murder!\nGumshoe:\nH-Hey, wait...\nYeehaw, a murder! Of a big star, no less!\nGumshoe:\nOh, man... I'm in trouble now...\nAfter clearing \"The victim\" and \"Arrested?\" Talk options in Gatewater Hotel - Hallway:\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nPowers:\nHey! So what's going on, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like Juan Corrida has been killed.\nPowers:\nWh-Wh-What!? Juan is... He's...!?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like he was murdered... And a suspect was arrested. That suspect is Mr. Matt Engarde.\nPowers:\nY-You're joking, right!?\nPhoenix:\nNope. They arrested the Nickel Samurai on suspicion of murdering the Jammin' Ninja.\nPowers:\nOoogh... Not again... I feel sick.\nPearl:\n\"Again\"...?\nPhoenix:\n...About a year ago, something just like this happened, Pearls.\nPowers:\nI still can't believe... No way... No way Matt would...\nPhoenix:\n(...? What's Mr. Powers got in his hand...?)\nPowers:\n...Oh, before I forget... This... This is for you, Mr. Wright. I got this from the bellboy that came by earlier.\nRadio Transceiver received from Mr. Powers.\nPhoenix:\n...For me...? But why?\nPowers:\nI don't know. All he said was it was for Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPearl:\nUm... I was just wondering... Where's Mystic Maya? She's been gone a long time.\nPhoenix:\n(Now that she mentions it, she was only going to answer a phone call...)\nPearl:\nMaybe she got lost. I'll take a quick look around for her.\n...*beep beep beep*...\nPhoenix:\nAck!\nPearl:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Nick!?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? I... I'm not sure... (It's coming from this transceiver...) (Changed from [Did this transceiver just...?] in the original release)\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, hello? Wright here...\n???:\nIs this Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney?\nPhoenix:\nAnd you are...!?\n???:\nYou don't need to know who I am. I think you have other things to be concerning yourself with... Such as...\nMaya:\nHeeelp! Niiiiick!\nPearl:\nM-Mystic Maya!\nPhoenix:\nMaya...?\n???:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Wouldn't you agree that the more important issue is the fate of the girl?\nPhoenix:\n(Her fate? Does he mean what I think he means...?) Maya! Where are you!? Are you hurt!?\n???:\nCome now. Don't fall apart on me yet.\nPhoenix:\n(Th-This... No! This can't be!)\n???:\nNow that I have your attention, Mr. Attorney, I have a modest proposal for you. If you do what I require, then I will return to you your valuable \"item\" unharmed. ...What is this called again in your fancy lawyer terms?\nPhoenix:\n...\"Kidnapping for ransom\"...\n???:\nYes, that's it. This is a kidnapping.\nPearl:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Mystic Maya! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!\nPhoenix:\n(M-My sight... Everything's fading away... Maya... Maya... Maya's been kidnapped!)\n???:\n...--re you there? Mr. Attorney, are you there? (Changed from [You there? Mr. Wright, are you there?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nH-How much!? How much do you want!?\n???:\nVery good, Mr. Attorney. I'm glad you have such a good grasp of the situation.\nPhoenix:\nHurry up and state your condition! And then return Maya--\n???:\nMoney is not what I seek.\nPhoenix:\n...What?\n???:\nWhat I want is a certain verdict. I would like a complete acquittal.\nPhoenix:\nComplete acquittal!? Wh-What in the world have you done to need...!?\n???:\nI am not the person you will be representing.\nPhoenix:\nWhat...?\n???:\nYou are currently at the Gatewater Hotel, are you not? And I know that a murder has just taken place there.\nPhoenix:\nJuan Corrida was killed, and the suspect is Matt Engarde...\n???:\nYou are, as expected, quite on top of things, Mr. Attorney. Now then. What I want is very simple. I want you to obtain a complete acquittal for Matt Engarde.\nPhoenix:\nM-Matt Engarde? But why?\n???:\nHe did not kill anyone. I can attest to that. However...\nPhoenix:\nH-However!? However what!?\n???:\nHowever, someone is framing him for the murder. A very smart someone who is setting him up to take the fall...\nPhoenix:\n... (If I agree and do what he wants, can I believe he'll keep his end of the bargain!?)\n???:\nYou are, of course, at liberty to take me at my word or not. (Changed from [You are, of course, at liberty to believe me or not.] in the original release) However, there is one thing you can take as fact. Right now, your very precious \"item\" is with me, in my possession.\nMaya:\nMmngnhhh... Heeelp!... Nngmph... NIIIICK!\nPhoenix:\nMaya!\n???:\nYou have two days. Of course, tonight, he will be in questioning with the police. But the trial is in two days. At that trial, you will win a not guilty verdict. Remember, you only have one chance. One chance, Mr. Attorney. (Changed from [Remember, you only have one chance. One chance, Mr. Wright.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nO-One...!? Y-You expect me to get a not guilty in one trial day!?\n???:\nYes, exactly. I don't believe I was wrong in choosing you, so don't let me down.\nPhoenix:\nAagh!\n???:\nOh, yes, that's right. Now that I am playing the role of the kidnapper, I can't pass up this chance to say, \"And don't even think about callin' the cops!\" ...Hmm, not great, but you get the idea.\nPhoenix:\nD-Dammit! Who... Who the hell are you!?\n???:\nAlright, I'll tell you that much. My name is... ...De Killer.\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick! Wh-Where is Mystic Maya!?\nPhoenix:\n...She's been kidnapped.\nPearl:\nN-No... ... It's all my fault! If only I had gone with Mystic Maya...!\nPhoenix:\nIt's not your fault, Pearls.\nPearl:\nBut it is! It is! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaaaa! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\nPowers:\nMr. Wright... I think we... I think we should tell the police what it's [sic] going on...!\nPhoenix:\n(No! We can't do that! If we do, who knows what will happen to Maya...)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! What about the detective we saw earlier...?\nPhoenix:\n(...Detective Gumshoe!) Yes, that's it! Wait here, and I'll be right back!\nPowers:\nAlright! I'll take care of Pearl while you're away!\nHallway\nGumshoe:\nWHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!? RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANSOM!?\nPhoenix:\nShhh! Not so loud! ...The ransom is complete acquittal for Matt Engarde.\nGumshoe:\nWait, the deal is \"complete acquittal\" in exchange for Maya, you mean...? Then this means Matt Engarde is obviously the killer, pal! No doubt about it!\nPhoenix:\nBut the guy said that Mr. Engarde is innocent...\nGumshoe:\nYou really believe what a KIDNAPPER tells you, pal!?\nPhoenix:\n(I guess he has a point... If Engarde is really innocent, then why the kidnapping?)\nGumshoe:\nAnd on top of everything else, there's all this evidence we keep finding.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nThe forensics team's having a field day back there. (Changed from [The guys with the eagle eyes are really lapping it up like they just caught a huge fish.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nGumshoe:\nBut it's strange. There's so much evidence that it feels like something's wrong.\nPhoenix:\nThere's too much evidence? Is that possible? (Actually, didn't the kidnapper say something about Engarde being \"set-up\"...?)\nGumshoe:\nAnyway, looks like you won't be leaving here tonight, pal. Just sit tight and cooperate with the investigation. Tomorrow you can start yours.\nPhoenix:\n...A-Alright... (Isn't there another way...?)\nGumshoe:\nWe've also got to be careful about pushing the kidnapper the wrong way.\nPhoenix:\nYou're right...\nDate: ??? Time: ???Location: ???\nMaya:\nNnngh... Oww, my head... (Wh-Where... Where am I!? I wonder if I'm still in that hotel... Wh-What happened to me...?) Nick... Pearly! ... (Come on, you guys. This isn't funny anymore...)\n...*ka-click*...\n???:\nI see you have awoken.\nMaya:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Wh-Wh-Wh-Who are you!?\n???:\nMe? ...I am known as \"De Killer\".\nMaya:\n\"D-De Killer\"!? You mean like an \"ASSASSIN\"!? (I... I'm too young to die!)\n???:\nDon't worry. You are not my target. ...For now anyway.\nMaya:\nA-Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Nick! Nick! Where are you!? ...Help me...\n???:\nYes, that's right. Only one person can save you now, and that is Mr. Phoenix Wright.\nMaya:\n...Huh? Wh-What? Nick... Nick's going to save me...?\n???:\nCalm down and be a good girl. Think of this as a business transaction.\nMaya:\nA... A business transaction?\n???:\nI am going to contact him now. I hope you'll cooperate and play your assigned role well.\nMaya:\n...Nick... What's going to happen to me? Nick... Pearly... (Changed from [What's going to happen to me? Nick... Pearls...] in the original release) ...Sis...\n???:\n... Is this Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney? ... You don't need to know who I am. I think you have other things to be concerning yourself with... Such as...\nMarch 21, 8:11 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nPearl:\nGood morning!\nPhoenix:\nAh, morning, Pearls.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Mr. Nick! Come on! Let's hurry and go see Mr. Engarde!\nPhoenix:\nWe have to wait a bit, Pearls. Visiting hours don't start until 9 AM, so...\nPearl:\nOh, I see. Ah, Mystic Maya! If only... If only I had gone with you... (Changed from [Ah, Mystic Maya! If only... If only I went with you that time...] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Pearls... She's been like this since last night... We managed to get home somehow, yesterday evening... Thanks to Detective Gumshoe gently holding her by the hand and leading her here... But by the looks of it, I don't think Pearls got any sleep at all last night.)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Mystic Maya... She's alright, right!?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, she's alright. Either way, I'm going to save her. You can trust me on that.\nPearl:\nPlease... Please... Help her...\nPhoenix:\n(I'm only able to stay this calm and collected... Because Pearls is doing the crying for the both of us...)\nMarch 21, 8:57 AMDetention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\n(We couldn't wait for visiting hours to start, so Pearls and I came down here early... To visit one Nickel Samurai, charged with the murder of the Jammin' Ninja...)\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nG-Good morning. How are you today?\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nI know this situation might be a little tough for you...\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nUm... We're...\nEngarde:\nOh, sorry dude...\nPhoenix:\n...?\nEngarde:\nI already signed up...\nPhoenix:\nE-Excuse me...?\nEngarde:\nI already have life insurance. I signed up a long time ago cause my job is, you know...\nPhoenix:\n... Oh! No no no... We're not insurance salespeople!\nEngarde:\nReally...? Dude, I really don't need that right now either.\nPhoenix:\n...?\nEngarde:\nFire extinguishers. I mean, this building isn't my house, so...\nPhoenix:\n... No no no... We're not here to sell you fire extinguishers either! I'm a lawyer. My name is Phoenix Wright.\nEngarde:\nA lawyer...? ... Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask my manager, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nThe Nickel Samurai sure is a strange person, isn't he?\nPhoenix:\n(I think \"strange\" is an understatement.)\nEngarde:\nSorry about that. You're just in time.\nPhoenix:\nHuh!?\nEngarde:\nYou're a lawyer dude, right? My manager's looking for a good one right now, so how about it?\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick! This is our chance!\nPhoenix:\n(I have to make him let me take his case! I have to!)\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Press Conference Ticket and Radio Transceiver:\nEngarde:\n... ...Well, dude, I think it's about time for me to get going.\nPhoenix:\nPlease, wait! ...I really need to take your case!\nEngarde:\nThere's always other people in need of a lawyer, right? Want me to introduce you to a few?\nPearl:\nPlease! Please let Mr. Nick represent you!\nEngarde:\nMan, oh man. Lawyers these days. Now you dudes use kids to pull in clients, too?\nPhoenix:\nIf you don't take me as your lawyer, then De Killer is going to...!\nEngarde:\n... Wait... What did you just say?\nPhoenix:\n\"De Killer\"...\nEngarde:\nD-De Killer!?\nPhoenix:\n(...What's he doing? He looks like he's mulling something over...)\nEngarde:\n... Alright, dude. I accept your terms.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEngarde:\nI'll let you represent me in court.\nPearl:\nW-We did it! We did it, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nUh, yeah... (I don't feel any better for it... And he doesn't look too happy either...)\nEngarde:\nGo ahead, ask me anything. I'll help out as much as I can...\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\n... (...I guess this is about all I'm going to get out of him...)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah?\nPearl:\nLet's ask one last thing. Let's test Mr. Engarde to see if he really is innocent or not...\nPhoenix:\nW-We can do that...?\nPearl:\nYes. If you use this...\nPhoenix:\n(Maya's Magatama!)\nPearl:\nHe won't be able to hide any secrets from you, Mr. Nick. I'm sure of it.\nPhoenix:\n(I get it...!) ...Mr. Engarde, I'd like to ask you one more question. Please answer me honestly.\nEngarde:\nWhat is it, dude?\nPhoenix:\nDid you kill Mr. Juan Corrida?\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nPlease put the phone away and answer this question yourself.\nEngarde:\nAlright. Just so we're clear, dude, I didn't kill anyone, and that includes Juan Corrida, OK?\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nWell, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nNothing. Not a chain or lock in sight.\nPearl:\nWhich means... I think it is alright to trust him.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, it does appear that way. Well, at least I can breathe a sigh of relief knowing my client is innocent.)\nEngarde:\nUm... The trial's tomorrow, right? I'm counting on you, dude.\nTo be continued.\nMarch 21, 11:34 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nWell, at least we were able to get Mr. Matt Engarde as our client. And we know that he didn't do it... Which is very important...\nPearl:\nSo! So now what should we do!?\nPhoenix:\nWell, the trial is tomorrow. And we only get this one chance. There's only one way to prove Mr. Engarde's innocence. We have to find the real killer.\nPearl:\nOK! Then let's start looking!\nMarch 21Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nEngarde:\nAh, the lawyer dude. So what did you find out?\nPhoenix:\nUm, well... I'm still in the middle of investigating...\nEngarde:\nI see. ...But I've already told you everything I know, dude.\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nOldbag:\nHey! What do you think you're doing!? You can't come in without...\nPearl:\nGood morning.\nOldbag:\nHold on, it's YOU! What is going on around here!?\nPhoenix:\nU-Uh... Um...\nOldbag:\nI heard poor Juan was killed. Is that true!? It's a bad rerun is what this is. Another \"Steel Samurai\" doing the most evil of deeds.\nPhoenix:\nUm, you know... That's not entirely...\nOldbag:\nI'll have you know that I was a huge fan of Juan's! Why, oh why, do all the stars I'm interested in drop one by one like flies!? It's always been that way! Ever since I was a little girl in elementary school! The class hamster was fine until it was my turn to clean its cage, and then it died! The other kids started calling me the \"Queen Reaper\". I swear that's what they dubbed me! \"Whoever you name in your evil spell dies within three minutes,\" they would taunt.\nPhoenix:\nUm... Actually, I wanted to ask you about the murder and what happened...\nOldbag:\nHmph! Don't push me, boy!\nPearl:\nUm... Mr. Nick? I... Um... I couldn't hear everything she said... because she was talking too fast...\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, could you please speak a little slower...?\nOldbag:\nDon't boss me around, you spiky-haired, smarty-pants!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelViola Hall\nPhoenix:\nLooks like the investigation is still in full swing. The hotel staff and the police are running around like a bunch of headless chickens.\nPearl:\nI wonder if we can do any investigating of our own in this kind of atmosphere...\nPhoenix:\n...Well, got to roll up the sleeves and try, I guess.\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelHallway\nLotta:\nHey!

Where are we?\nPhoenix:\nWe're in Mr. Matt Engarde's dressing room... This is our client's room.\n???:\nMay I help you with something?\nPhoenix:\nUm, uh... We're...\n???:\nYou're Mr. Engarde's lawyer, correct? I gathered as much. I also looked for lawyers on my end, but to no avail.\nPhoenix:\nUm... How did you know I'm his lawyer...?\n???:\nYou were just saying that he is your client. In a situation like this, the only person who would use such a word would be his lawyer.\nPearl:\nWow...\n???:\nIt's simple deduction, really. The trial is tomorrow, and Mr. Engarde's situation is looking rather grim. So you came here, one stop in your mad dash, to find clues to build his case, correct?\nPhoenix:\nWell, you're not totally right, but you're not totally off either.\nPearl:\nIt's really not the time to be showing off, Mr. Nick.\nAndrews:\nI am Adrian Andrews. I hate to waste time, so let's get down to business.\nPhoenix:\nA-Alright...

What's happened!? The kidnapper! Has he contacted you again!?\nPhoenix:\nNot yet. He probably won't until we win Mr. Engarde's acquittal.\nGumshoe:\nUmm... You doing OK, pal? Hanging in there?\nPhoenix:\n(I just want Maya to be alright...)\nPearl:\n...\nGumshoe:\nWe don't have a lot of time left, but I'm going to help you as much as I can, pal.\nPhoenix:\nCan you do that? Even if we want to look around the crime scene...?\nGumshoe:\nJust this once... \"Special circumstances\" right, pal? I'll even tell you everything I know. But you've gotta keep quiet. It's my neck on the line here.\nPhoenix:\nThank you.\nGumshoe:\nOh, that's right. I got you guys a map of the hotel, pal. Here you go, little missy.\nPearl:\nWow, you're giving it to me!? Thank you!\nGumshoe:\nHa ha. Wouldn't want you to get lost in a hotel too big for its own good.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! I got a map!\nPhoenix:\nThat's great, Pearls!\nPearl:\n... Um...

I am a woman who can only live in insecurity. I'm physically small, and I don't really have a lot of self-confidence. I've pushed against all that, though... I've tried to live strongly. I never wanted anyone to find out the truth...\nPearl:\nMs. Andrews...\nAndrews:\nThis one thing... It's the one thing I wanted to take with me to the grave... It was my secret. Mine and mine alone.\nPhoenix:\nI... I'm sorry.\nAndrews:\nYou probably think I'm a worthless human being right now, don't you?\nPhoenix:\nPlease, Ms. Andrews. All I want to know is the truth.\nAndrews:\nAfter Celeste passed away, I heard that someone had hidden her suicide note... And that someone was Juan Corrida. Celeste... Without her... Without her, I became scared. Everything... Everyone seemed like they were out to get me.\nPhoenix:\nSo you got close to Mr. Corrida to recover her suicide note, correct?\nAndrews:\n... Looks like that tabloid reported the truth after all. Ironic, isn't it?\nPhoenix:\nWell, like they say, where there's smoke, there's fire.\nAndrews:\nAnd if they purposely add fuel to the fire, they keep the celebrity world burning.\nPearl:\n...\nAndrews:\nBut as for the suicide note? I didn't and wouldn't kill anyone for it. It just doesn't suit me, that's all.\nAndrews:\n... Well, that's enough for now. I still have work to do, so...\nPhoenix:\nI understand.\nAndrews:\nOh, I have one small favor to ask. My... attempted suicide... I'd like for you to keep it a secret.\nPearl:\nMs. Andrews...\nAndrews:\nIf... If people found out about my weakness... I... I would sooner choose to die than live.\nPhoenix:\nA-A-Alright!

I, Miles Edgeworth, will be taking her place. The prosecution is ready... naturally.\nEdgeworth:\nMs. von Karma was shot in her right shoulder, and is currently undergoing surgery. Luckily, I have looked this case over and am familiar with the details. The prosecution seeks to prove the guilt of Mr. Matt Engarde.\nJudge:\nTh-The court acknowledges the prosecution.\nEdgeworth:\n...Wright. I finally found the answer I was struggling for on my long journey this past year. By the time this case comes to an end, you too, will know the answer.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nNow then, the prosecution would like to call its first witness... Please bring Detective Gumshoe to the witness stand!\nEdgeworth:\nWitness, your name and occupation.\nGumshoe:\nMy name's Dick Gumshoe, sir. I'm a detective down at the precinct... for now.\nJudge:\n\"For now\"...?\nGumshoe:\nAfter this trial's over... I'm supposed to turn in my badge, sir.\nPhoenix:\n(D-Detective Gumshoe...)\nEdgeworth:\nThe prosecution has no need for a depressed witness. Lift your head up and face forward like a proud officer, Detective Dick Gumshoe!\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nNow, let's have your testimony. If we want to explore the various facets of this case, we must start with that.\nMia:\nGet ready, Phoenix. This is going to be one very rough fight.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... It would have to be with Edgeworth as my opponent.  (The answer he was \"struggling\" for... Interesting... Show me this \"answer\" you finally found, Edgeworth...)\nWitness Testimony\n-- Bare Facts of the Case --\nGumshoe:\nThis murder happened after the Hero of Heroes award ceremony, sir.\nThe victim, Juan Corrida, was found dead in his hotel room.\nAfter looking into the cause of death, we believe he was definitely murdered, sir.\nAt first, we thought there was something suspicious about the empty guitar case.\nHowever, we later found out that the guitar case had nothing to do with the murder.\nJudge:\nHmm... After the award ceremony ended, the victim was alone in his room...?\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir! Both the victim and defendant went alone to their rooms, sir.\nJudge:\nI see. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- Bare Facts of the Case --\nGumshoe:\nThis murder happened after the Hero of Heroes award ceremony, sir.\nGumshoe:\nThe victim, Juan Corrida, was found dead in his hotel room.\nGumshoe:\nAfter looking into the cause of death, we believe he was definitely murdered, sir.\nGumshoe:\nAt first, we thought there was something suspicious about the empty guitar case.\nGumshoe:\nHowever, we later found out that the guitar case had nothing to do with the murder.\nMia:\nOur first order of business should be to gather more info from his testimony.\nPhoenix:\nBut there might be a trap set up for us somewhere...\nMia:\nMaybe. However, setting off traps is a part of a lawyer's job too.\nPhoenix:\nIf you say so...\nMia:\nOf course, we're supposed to escape from them too, wouldn't you say?\nAfter pressing third, fourth and fifth statements:\nEdgeworth:\nI believe that is enough. First, the victim was choked to death with his bandana. Then, after the victim was dead, the killer deliberately stabbed him with a knife.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nEdgeworth:\nWhich brings me to my next point. Why then, did the police arrest Matt Engarde...? Because there was reason enough to suspect him.\nPhoenix:\n(Here it comes... Looks like Edgeworth's back in full swing...)\nJudge:\nVery well. Detective Gumshoe, please testify about this matter.\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir!\nWitness Testimony\n-- Why Arrest Engarde? --\nGumshoe:\nMatt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other.\nThey each thought the other guy was \"in his way\". That's motive enough in my book.\nAs for evidence... There's the Jammin' Ninja's button.\nIt was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's \"hakama\".\nThe defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife.\nThe defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!\nJudge:\nHmm... So the defendant's fingerprints were found on the knife used in the stabbing.\nGumshoe:\nIt was sort of sticky on the handle, so the fingerprints came out pretty clearly, sir.\nKnife added to the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\n...And there's this button.\nJudge:\nThat was found in the defendant's clothes, was it? Hmm... And is this button also covered in blood...?\nGumshoe:\nYes, and we know that the blood on it is the victim's blood, sir.\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nJammin' Ninja's Button added to the Court Record.\nJudge:\nAll of this points very clearly to the defendant, doesn't it?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, it most certainly does, Your Honor. Ready to give in yet, Wright?\nPhoenix:\nHmph! I'll find the hole in your argument somehow!\nEdgeworth:\nYou can press as hard as you'd like. Just hurry up with your usual pointless questions.\nPhoenix:\nGrrrrrrrrr...\nCross Examination\n-- Why Arrest Engarde? --\nGumshoe:\nMatt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other.\nGumshoe:\nThey each thought the other guy was \"in his way\".

If the judge were more rash, he would've already pounded his gavel in closing.\nPhoenix:\nWe're still in a world of trouble...\nMia:\nWell, before any battle, you must find your enemy's weakness. So let's find the weakness in this testimony, no matter how small it may be, OK Phoenix?\nPhoenix:\nWait a second!\nGumshoe:\nWh-What?\nPhoenix:\nSo the basis of your argument that this was a premeditated murder is simply that my client \"bought a knife beforehand\"?\nGumshoe:\nThat's right, pal. The defendant...\nPhoenix:\n...Did not buy this knife.\nGumshoe:\nH-Huh!?\nPhoenix:\nTake a good look at the handle of this knife, and you'll know what I'm talking about.\nGumshoe:\n...Huh?\nJudge:\nIt has a \"Gatewater\" seal set into the handle...\nGumshoe:\n\"Gatewater\"...? I think I've heard that name somewhere before.\nPhoenix:\nThat's the name of the hotel. The Gatewater Hotel.\nGumshoe:\n... Uh oh.\nPhoenix:\nThe murder knife was actually property of the hotel! Which means this murder was not premeditated!\nJudge:\nYes, that is very true! This is a very big...\nEdgeworth:\nHeh heh heh...\nJudge:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nI'm sorry, but the defense is simply too careless.\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nEdgeworth:\nI think whether the crime was premeditated or not... has already been determined.\nPhoenix:\nH-How so!?\nEdgeworth:\nI admit this knife is hotel property. There is no one currently on the police force that is dumb enough not to realize this.\nGumshoe:\n...But I didn't kn... Oh... *whimper*\nEdgeworth:\nThe question is... Where did this knife come from?\nJudge:\nWh-Why that's obvious! It came from the victim, Mr. Corrida's room...\nEdgeworth:\nSorry, Your Honor, but that is incorrect. The victim ate a last meal before he was murdered. With that being the case... I would like to draw the court's attention to what is on top of the table.\nJudge:\nThere is a knife and a fork on the table! Then... Where in the world did this knife come from!?\nEdgeworth:\nIf it pleases the court... I would like for us to recall the room of the defendant, Mr. Matt Engarde. Especially what was on top of his table... There is something missing... Perhaps, it is a single knife? We investigated the leftover dishes for fingerprints, and while we were investigating, we came to the conclusion that Mr. Matt Engarde's knife was missing.\nPhoenix:\nUrk...\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Engarde had gone to the victim's room with the knife he had used during dinner. Why would he carry a knife on a visit? To kill, of course. And with that, I believe the prosecution has proven... This was a premeditated murder.\nJudge:\nAmazing, Mr. Edgeworth. Absolutely brilliant. A brilliantly clear deduction.\nMia:\nIt seems like Edgeworth had this planned from the very beginning...\nPhoenix:\n(This must be one of those \"traps\", and I just walked headlong into it!)\nJudge:\nA murder weapon with fingerprints, and a button from the victim's costume. There is quite a sizable amount of evidence here.\nEdgeworth:\nI can safely say that any further deliberation is a waste of Your Honor's time. Although... I wouldn't mind if the defense were to present evidence not yet shown to the court.\nPhoenix:\n(Evidence not yet shown...?)\nMia:\nHe means evidence that the court hasn't seen yet. In other words, new evidence.\nJudge:\nWhat does the defense have to say about this, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nUm, well...\nMia:\nPhoenix. The judge is favoring the prosecution right now. If we answer with something wrong here...\nPhoenix:\n(That gavel of his will be ringing out to the sound of our defeat!)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, do you have something important and necessary to present to this court?\nPhoenix:\nThere's one...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nOne piece of evidence that catches my attention. Something that this court has yet to see!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. I will say this one more time. I do not feel this trial needs to continue at all. ... However, I am giving you one chance... and only one.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat the judge is saying, Wright, is don't try pulling one of your usual bluffs here.\nPhoenix:\n(If I mess this up, it's curtains for all of us!)\nJudge:\nYou may now present one, and only one piece of evidence. Now then, what is this important evidence that you must show to the court?\nJudge:\nThis... is a wine glass, is it not?\nPhoenix:\nPlease look at the photo of the crime scene one more time! The scene is a mess because of the victim's struggle against his assailant. The vase was broken, his makeup is all over the floor... These were all things that were at one point, sitting on top of the dresser.\nJudge:\nHmm... Well, yes, I see your point.\nPhoenix:\nHowever! This glass, that is sitting on top of the dresser, is mysteriously untouched. The only thing that had not fallen over along with everything else is this wine glass! This piece of evidence is more than strange enough to warrant further consideration!\nJudge:\n...\nGumshoe:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nW-Well? What do you all have to say...?\nJudge:\nAh, well, yes, it is a little peculiar...\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, isn't it!? I thought it was!\nJudge:\nYou can stop looking at me with those puppy dog eyes of yours now. Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is it, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nYour opinion...\nEdgeworth:\n...You don't need my opinion. Because there is no special meaning to that glass.\nPhoenix:\n...What!?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's safe to say that the glass was set there after the crime took place. By the person who discovered the body, Adrian Andrews, for example. She could have easily been so shocked that she set the glass down without thinking.\nJudge:\nHmm... That does sound very plausible. Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(Could Ms. Andrews really have set that glass down without thinking...?)\nPhoenix:\nThe defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory. We would like to see something that proves it was Ms. Andrews who set the cup on the table!\nJudge:\nHmm... You've turned the situation on its head yet again, as usual. Mr. Edgeworth. Do you have any proof to back up your claim?\nPhoenix:\n(There's no way he has any. He's just bluffing!)\nEdgeworth:\nUnlike Mr. Wright, I never say anything unless I have the evidence to support it.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!?\nEdgeworth:\nYou're not thinking hard enough today, Wright. Did you think this wine glass escaped my notice?\nPhoenix:\nTh-Then...\nEdgeworth:\nOf course it has been thoroughly inspected... for fingerprints.\nPhoenix:\nFingerprints...\nEdgeworth:\nThere were only one set of fingerprints left on this wine glass.\nJudge:\nOnly one? Well, whose were they!?\nEdgeworth:\nThey were not the victim's nor the defendant's. Rather, they were of one Adrian Andrews.\nPhoenix:\nWHAT!?\nWine Glass updated in the Court Record.\nEdgeworth:\nThat is why I said that the person who had discovered the body had left it there. Are we done here, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(Grrr! I can't believe I fell into another trap!)\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Andrews was probably holding the glass when she went to see Mr. Corrida. But upon seeing his dead body, she was stunned, and set the glass down on the dresser.\nJudge:\nHmm... What you just said makes a lot of sense.\nEdgeworth:\nTsk tsk tsk... Now do you see, Wright? You can't change any part of my scenario as it explains everything all too well.\nPhoenix:\nGrrr!\nEdgeworth:\nI've thought long and hard this past year about what it means to be a \"prosecutor\". And from here on out, I will show you the answer I have come to discover!\nJudge:\nW-Wait a second... Mr. Edgeworth! I think the prosecution has provided enough evidence for me to enter my verdict...\nEdgeworth:\nUnfortunately, I can not allow you to pass judgment yet. The prosecution has yet another witness we would like the court to hear from.\nPhoenix:\n\"Another witness\"...?\nEdgeworth:\nYes. Bailiff! Please bring in the next witness!\nMia:\nWhat in the world is Mr. Edgeworth thinking?\nEdgeworth:\nNow then, witness, please state your name and occupation...\nOldbag:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n... Witness! Your name and occupation, please!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nEdgeworth:\nUurrngh!\nOldbag:\n...Heh. G.O.T.C.H.A!\nEdgeworth:\nGrrrrrrrrr...\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder what happened to that calm composure he had earlier...)\nOldbag:\nOh, Edgey-boy! It's been what, a year since we last met, hasn't it? You should be more happy to see me!\nEdgeworth:\nI saw the report with her testimony, but who knew that under that helmet... it was the wicked witch of the witness stand!?\nOldbag:\nI tell you, this time I know what I'm supposed to do! So today, I'm going to tell you anything and everything! Even things that don't have to do with that terrible crime.\nJudge:\nMs... Witness... \"That terrible crime\" is all this court needs to know.\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nJudge:\nOof!\nOldbag:\nShush! I'm talking to my dear Edgey-Wedgey right now! Don't interrupt us, gramps!\nJudge:\nYes, madam.\nEdgeworth:\nNo no no, please, by all means interrupt her! Please! *ahem* Anyway, witness, your testimony please.\nOldbag:\nIt's true what they say, that youth are hotheaded nowadays. Not that I mind at all, Edgey. Now then, what should I start with...?\nEdgeworth:\nThe witness was on security detail at the hotel on the night of the murder. Is this correct, Ms. Oldbag?\nOldbag:\nIt was a great job being able to see my dearie Juan! It was almost too much for my little heart to handle!\nJudge:\nYou mean... You were a fan of the victim?\nOldbag:\nLook, everyone is crazy over that Engarde, saying he's cute in a fresh way, or something. But not me! I wouldn't say anything so silly. After all, I have no interest in a little child like him. I'm only interested in a real man: Juan Corrida!\nPhoenix:\n(Um... But those two were the same age...)\nOldbag:\nAnyway, as I was saying, I was pacing in front of his room that night.\nEdgeworth:\nVery well. Please tell the court what you witnessed the night of the murder.\nOldbag:\nLeave it to me, Edgey-poo!\nWitness Testimony\n-- What You Witnessed --\nOldbag:\nAnyway, after the ceremony, I went to pace around in the hallway in front of his room.\nThere was something I was interested in finding out, you know...\nWell, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time.\nThat's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room.\nIt was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!\nJudge:\nHmm... So Mr. Engarde came out from the victim's room...\nOldbag:\nSee! It has to be him! He's the murderer!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nJudge:\nI see. Well, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- What You Witnessed --\nOldbag:\nAnyway, after the ceremony, I went to pace around in the hallway in front of his room.\nOldbag:\nThere was something I was interested in finding out, you know...\nOldbag:\nWell, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time.\nOldbag:\nThat's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room.\nOldbag:\nIt was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!\nOldbag:\nHe was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show.\nMia:\nShe may not remember things or be mistaken here and there, but I don't think she's lying.\nPhoenix:\nThat's bad for us. Really bad.\nMia:\nBut, that's how the human mind is. It also has the tendency to jump off-topic. She's strayed onto a few interesting side-topics this time too, hasn't she? But that's what makes her a sweet old lady, right?\nPhoenix:\n(That's because you're not the one who has to question her...)\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag...\nOldbag:\nWhat!? Don't say my name for no reason!\nPhoenix:\nDo you know what this is?\nOldbag:\nAaaah! It's button number 2 on the Jammin' Ninja's costume!\nPhoenix:\n(Now I KNOW she's an obsessed fan... She identified it in a single glance!)\nOldbag:\nGive it here! Give it here! If you don't give it to me, I'll punish you with this!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... She really is a die-hard fan to want a button covered in blood...) This button was discovered on Mr. Engarde's body during a full body search.\nOldbag:\nSee! See! This button proves beyond a shadow of a doubt it was that rascal Engarde!\nPhoenix:\nIt was caught up in the pleats of his Nickel Samurai hakama pants.\nOldbag:\nSee! See! And Engarde is the Nickel Samurai!\nPhoenix:\n...Witness! Now, it may just be me, and I do have an active imagination, but just now, didn't you say that the defendant... Matt Engarde was wearing his \"usual racing jacket\"!?\nOldbag:\n... ... ... Ah... I'm so sorry. Sorry that you judge people based on what they wear! If I wore the trendiest dress, then maybe you'd think I was the most gorgeous woman ever! But instead, I have to put up with wearing this ridiculous-looking outfit. You'd agree this outfit is hideous, right? I've got a tape recorder stuck on my chest! Lemme tell you, it's HEAVY! So heavy, I wish we would have switched to CDs ages ago! But I'm keeping that dream alive for all those kids out there, I work hard with a smile on my face, don't you understand!? Now, take a look in the mirror. Your clothes are about as interesting as a documentary on curling! You should take a tip or ten from Edgey-poo. Now HE'S got style!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nJudge:\nNow hold your tongue still there for one second! So what you saw in actuality, was not Mr. Engarde, the man... but Mr. Engarde, the Nickel Samurai!?\nOldbag:\nBut when you think about it... They're really one and the same anyway...\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag! This is a very important point we're talking about!\nOldbag:\nEdgey-poo! Do you think so too?\nEdgeworth:\nWell, it might be something worth considering. (Changed from [Well, it might be something worth thinking about.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nJust say, \"It's important\" and agree with me for a change!\nJudge:\nWitness! Think carefully and try to remember as much as you can before you testify!\nOldbag:\n*sigh* Alright, if you insist.\nPhoenix:\n(I should be the one sighing, not you!)\nWitness Testimony\n-- Who I Saw --\nOldbag:\nEngarde... Engarde... Yes, now I remember!\nThe Nickel Samurai, that's right, it was the Nickel Samurai that I saw!\nYes, it would have been convenient for him to wear his costume during the murder.\nHe had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know.\nSo he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan.\nPhoenix:\nI... I knew it... I knew you'd say he was inside that costume!\nOldbag:\nWhat? Did you think there could've been someone else inside that costume? Don't be a bad little boy, thinking such rude things.\nPhoenix:\nBut... But the possibility does exist!\nOldbag:\nAh, young'uns today. I told you, there is no way it was anyone else.\nJudge:\nH-How do you know that?\nOldbag:\nBecause... I said so. And what I say is the truth.\nPhoenix:\n(At least she's just as delightful a witness as she was a year ago...)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.\nCross Examination\n-- Who I Saw --\nOldbag:\nEngarde... Engarde... Yes, now I remember!\nOldbag:\nThe Nickel Samurai, that's right, it was the Nickel Samurai that I saw!\nOldbag:\nYes, it would have been convenient for him to wear his costume during the murder.\nOldbag:\nHe had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know.\nOldbag:\nSo he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan.\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\nMia:\nYou don't need to think too hard on this one.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMia:\nThere's a contradiction in her testimony and it's sitting in plain sight. The question is what that contradiction means for us...\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I have to figure out what you're talking about first, but OK...)\nPhoenix:\nPlease take a look at this.\nOldbag:\nYeah, so, it's a knife. Big deal. If you're trying to scare me with that, I'll have you know it won't work!\nPhoenix:\nNo no, that's not my intention at all...\nJudge:\nThat's the knife that was used in the murder, correct?\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor. Do you know why this piece of evidence is important to this case?\nJudge:\nYou don't even have to ask. It's because the defendant's fingerprints are on it.\nEdgeworth:\n... Is that what you're driving at...?\nPhoenix:\nThat is exactly what I am driving at.\nJudge:\nWhat are we driving at? And whose car are we driving?\nPhoenix:\nIf Mr. Engarde was really in the Nickel Samurai costume at the time of the murder, then it's impossible for his fingerprints to have been left on this knife! Actually, he would have wiped all previous fingerprints on this knife right off!\nJudge:\nOh, that's right! The Nickel Samurai wears gloves, doesn't he?\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nHe probably took his gloves off before he began the stabbing!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAnd why would he do something like that? To leave his prints on the murder weapon? There is no way he would do something like that!\nEdgeworth:\nHowever, there is one possibility!\nPhoenix:\nThen let's hear your \"possibility\"!\nEdgeworth:\nIt's very simple. The defendant went to the victim's room while in costume as the Nickel Samurai. At that time, the defendant held no intent to murder. He was probably just going to relax and talk with the victim about the stage show. Which is why he took his gloves off!\nJudge:\nHmm... But the murder still did take place...\nEdgeworth:\nIt's well known that there was bad blood between the defendant and the victim. (Changed from [It's well known that the defendant and the victim had bad blood between them.] in the original release)\nJudge:\nHmm, yes... I have heard that before... (Changed from [Hmm, yes... I have heard of that...] in the original release) Well, Mr. Wright? What do you have to say about Mr. Edgeworth's theory...?\nPhoenix:\n(So let me get this straight. Edgeworth's theory goes like this: When the defendant went to the victim's room, he had no intentions of killing him. Now, up to this point, are there any problems with his theory...?)\nPhoenix:\nThis theory contradicts something in an earlier testimony!\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What are you babbling about...?\nPhoenix:\nNow, for argument sake, let's suppose Mr. Engarde was the killer. If that's the case, I think it's impossible for the killer to have gone to the victim's room without intent!\nPhoenix:\nThis knife. This was used by Mr. Engarde at dinner.\nJudge:\nY-Yes, we did establish that.\nPhoenix:\nWhich means that if my client was, in fact, the killer... Then he brought this knife with him when he went to visit Mr. Corrida.\nEdgeworth:\nI suppose...\nPhoenix:\nHowever, you just said it yourself. \"At that time, the defendant held no intent to murder.\" If that were true, then why would he bring a knife!? He wouldn't, would he!?\nEdgeworth:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\nWhich means, Mr. Edgeworth, your theory was flawed from supposition one! And one more thing! If the murderer was wearing the costume at the time of the murder... Then there should be glove marks left on the knife! Which means the defendant's fingerprints shouldn't be all over it like bees on a hive!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAnd that brings me to my final point... This knife was planted by the real killer to hide their identity and mislead us!\nJudge:\nO-Order! Order, I say! Order in the court!! Was this knife really planted by the killer!? Why would the murderer do such a thing!?\nPhoenix:\nIt's to frame my client, Mr. Engarde, of course!\nJudge:\nTo frame...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nA-Aren't you forcing the interpretation just a little too hard on this one!?\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nBut we just established that the witness saw the \"Nickel Samurai\" in costume, and if that were true, then there shouldn't be a single fingerprint on this knife!\nEdgeworth:\nGrrrrrrrrr! Witneeeeeesssssss!!\nOldbag:\n... Looks like I've made your life a tiny bit more difficult, huh Edgey-poo...? (Changed from [Looks like I've made your life a tiny bit more difficult, huh Edgey...?] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\nGnnnnngh...\nJudge:\nWitness, did you or did you not really see the Nickel Samurai?\nOldbag:\nWell, I guess at first I might have forgotten, but...\nPhoenix:\nAre you saying you mixed up Mr. Engarde with the Nickel Samurai, his character on TV!?\nOldbag:\nBut I mean, I can't really do anything about that now! (Changed from [But I mean, I can't really do anything about that!] in the original release) Look, I was waiting around in front of their doors because, well... Well, I wasn't waiting around for the Nickel Samurai, that's for sure!\nPhoenix:\n...! (She wasn't waiting for the \"Nickel Samurai\"...?) Alright then... Who were you waiting around for then?\nOldbag:\n... Hmph! That's top secret to anyone outside of security!\nJudge:\nI have a feeling that you were waiting for Mr. Juan Corrida. Am I correct, witness?\nOldbag:\nHa ha ha. The way you think, you are a sad amateur with a terrible case of near-sightedness.\nJudge:\nAmateur...? Me...? What am I an amateur of...?\nPhoenix:\n(So Oldbag was waiting around in front of the victim's room... But it doesn't sound like she was waiting to catch a glimpse of Mr. Corrida...)\nMia:\nMaybe... Phoenix! Maybe the old bag was waiting around for \"that\" person!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, if it's who I think Mia's hinting at... It's certainly possible...) Ms. Oldbag. You were waiting for this person to come out of the victim's room, weren't you?\nJudge:\nWho is this person...?\nPhoenix:\nThis is Adrian Andrews, Mr. Engarde's manager.\nJudge:\nB-But why would the defendant's manager be in the victim's room...?\nEdgeworth:\nIt seems that this is the latest rumor in circulation, Your Honor.\nJudge:\n...Hmm... Oh... This is... Well, this is... Hmm, hmm... Hah, I see...\nPhoenix:\n(The judge seems to be really into the \"article\"... If it can be called such a thing...)\nJudge:\nThen this manager with the initials A. A.... Are you saying it's...?\nEdgeworth:\nAdrian Andrews. Without a doubt, the witness thought so as well.\nOldbag:\n... Hmph. Looks like you found me out. Well, that's fine. I can throw away this whole \"sworn to confidentiality stuff\" then. (Changed from [Well, that's fine. I can throw away this whole sworn to confidentiality stuff.] in the original release)\nJudge:\nW-Witness...? What in the world are you...\nMia:\nWatch out, Phoenix. I've got a bad feeling about this... A very bad feeling.\nOldbag:\nI got some information... Some very secret information from a certain source. So that's why I was doing my own little investigation... In secret, of course.\nJudge:\nB-But what for...?\nOldbag:\nOh, just for myself... Personal reasons and all that.\nJudge:\n... Well, Mr. Edgeworth. How will you proceed from here?\nEdgeworth:\nI really don't want to do this, however I cannot simply let this point slide.\nJudge:\nI see. Very well then. Witness, please testify about this \"secret information\".\nOldbag:\nGet ready! This is going to take the wind out of you young'uns!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm sure we're all capable of handling this... Really, it's not like we're ten years old.)\nWitness Testimony\n-- Secret Information --\nOldbag:\nThat Engarde is one evil, evil man!\nHe thought he could ruin poor Juan by causing a huge scandal!\nSo to do that, he sent his own manager to get in close with Juan!\nI cannot condone such dirty tricks! So I took action!\n...Oh, and this is top secret, you got that!? Nobody else but you and me know yet, OK?\nJudge:\nThe defendant sent his manager...? What a distasteful topic for this court!\nOldbag:\nWhat!? Nobody's above gossip! And isn't there a saying!? \"The truth is never pleasant.\"\nPhoenix:\n(Never heard that one before...)\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth. What about this Adrian Andrews person...?\nEdgeworth:\nWe have looked into this matter, and found that the \"truth\" the article proposes is, in fact, baseless gossip.\nJudge:\nHmm... But should this be true... Then this proves that the defendant did bear ill-will towards the victim.\nPhoenix:\n(...So this means I have to smash this rumor once and for all.)\nJudge:\nNow then, Mr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.\nMia:\nBe careful. The old bag seems rather excited right now.\nOldbag:\nThat's right! Engarde is nothing but your average foul-blooded youth!\nPhoenix:\n(Well, as the old saying goes... You've gotta burn old bags with fire! Time to fire up the afterburners and hit the highway to the danger zone!)\nCross Examination\n-- Secret Information --\nOldbag:\nThat Engarde is one evil, evil man!\nOldbag:\nHe thought he could ruin poor Juan by causing a huge scandal!\nOldbag:\nSo to do that, he sent his own manager to get in close with Juan!\nOldbag:\nI cannot condone such dirty tricks! So I took action!\nOldbag:\n...Oh, and this is top secret, you got that!? Nobody else but you and me know yet, OK?\nMia:\nSounds like just another tidbit of gossip, doesn't it? But you can't just ignore it either. It makes your client look bad either way.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I don't think I heard anything really out of the ordinary just now...)\nMia:\nThere has to be something we can catch her on...\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah... And when I find it, I'm going to press the heck out of it...)\nPhoenix:\nThe \"investigative photographer\", Lotta Hart...\nJudge:\nOh yes... I remember that mischievous girl.\nPhoenix:\nShe reported that she had lost a certain note she had written to herself.\nJudge:\nShe reported such a thing...?\nPhoenix:\nOn that piece of paper, she had written down some of her outrageo... er, impressions about the relationship between the victim and Ms. Andrews.\nOldbag:\nWh-What!? Outrageous ideas, you say!?\nPhoenix:\nNo no no, I said impressions.\nOldbag:\nThen... Then...! Then everything written on this piece of paper is completely meaningless!?\nPhoenix:\nAh! That's it! That's the note!\nOldbag:\nAh! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH! Noooo! You see, this is something completely different! This is my top secret list of groceries to buyyyyyyy!!\nJudge:\nHmm, then you are the one who took Ms. Hart's note?\nOldbag:\nI'm a huuuuuuuge fan of Juan's, that's why! That infamous, puffy-haired whippersnapper... She's working with that evil Engarde! She said so herself! \"En garde! I'm his sidekick!\" She was so happy, smiling like a silly duck. I was only checking what she had written!\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nOldbag:\n... Edgey-poo! You believe me, don't you!?\nEdgeworth:\nNngh...\nOldbag:\nI was only trying to help out like the angel I am! It's only one little piece of paper! I've never taken anything else before!\nEdgeworth:\nYou really should come with a supply of cheese to match your vintage whine.\nJudge:\nWell, it was only a piece of paper. I suppose we can overlook this just this once.\nPhoenix:\n(She looks like she's really sorry... Should I forgive her?)\nPhoenix:\nWitness! You said that the only thing you stole was that note. Is this correct?\nOldbag:\nS-S-Stole!? Why don't you listen more carefully, you annoying brat!? I saved this piece of paper from the terrible, lonely trash can! That's all!\nPhoenix:\nYou're lying, dammit! And I can prove it!!\nOldbag:\nAre you putting my credibility under scrutiny again!?\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag! I don't believe that the note is the only thing you stole that night!\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag! That note was with a camera, inside its case, wasn't it?\nJudge:\nA camera...?\nPhoenix:\nYesterday, Lotta Hart was raising a huge stink over her camera. She kept saying something like, \"My sweetie $1,600 camera disappeared on me!\"\nJudge:\nWhy... Why... Witness!!\nOldbag:\nWhat is it, gramps?\nPhoenix:\nIf you have the note, then it is only logical that you have the camera too!\nOldbag:\nGrr... Looks like you found me out again, sonny... Is this the camera you're looking for?\nPhoenix:\nAh, that's...!\nOldbag:\nWhat!? Even though I look like this, I'm still a person, you know! I still eat meals like you, I fall in love... and \"borrow\" things from people!\nJudge:\nUm... I think your definition of \"borrow\" is a little off...\nOldbag:\nI saw that woman's business card and that's when I noticed it said, \"Slimebag Celebrity Photographer Extraordinaire\"! Well, when I saw that, I had to know what sort of pictures she had taken! I'm a professional security guard! It's my business to know these things!\nJudge:\nBailiff! Check this camera's photos. Hurry! We must examine them at once!\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Edgeworth... What do we have?\nEdgeworth:\nThere is only one photo that seems to be relevant to this case.\nJudge:\nPlease present it to the court! Th-This is... This is the Nickel Samurai!\nOldbag:\nSee, I told you! That's the guy I saw!\nJudge:\nThis proves that the witness was not lying earlier about this matter.\nLotta's Photo added to the Court Record.\nJudge:\nWh-What does all this mean, Mr. Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\nThis photo by itself does not prove that the person in it is the defendant. However! In his own confession, Mr. Engarde clearly stated that... At the time of the murder, he was still in his Nickel Samurai costume!\nJudge:\nIf that is the case, then... this Nickel Samurai is...\nEdgeworth:\nThe defendant.\nJudge:\nHow did it come to this...? I think this brings us to the end. We have examined every piece of evidence thoroughly. Final comments, Mr. Wright? The court will consider them before we close. Do you agree that this photo is decisive evidence against your client?\nPhoenix:\n(If this photo really is decisive, then we're done for! But if I raise an objection here and blow it, then I would put Maya's life in jeopardy. I can't make a mistake here! There is only one road out of this mess!) This photo that Lotta took... There's...\nPhoenix:\nThere's... There's something strange with this photo!\nEdgeworth:\nI knew this was coming, Wright.\nJudge:\nYour thoughts, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nI think we can all agree there is nothing strange with this photo. There is no way for the defense to debunk this photo, even with a bunker buster.\nJudge:\n\"Debunk with a bunker buster\"!? Is that what you're planning to do, Mr. Wright!?\nPhoenix:\n... Um, anyway, please look at the photo one more time!\nJudge:\nIf you really believe you can honestly find something wrong with this photo, then you should only need one chance, correct...?\nPhoenix:\nUm... Well... (I have to find something wrong with this photo! I can't let this chance go by! Where in the heck did she take this photo from anyway...? (Changed from [Where in the heck did she take this picture anyway...?] in the original release) It's all out of focus! Why can't she take a good shot, especially when it counts!?)\nJudge:\nNow then, let's hear your objection. What about this photo is \"strange\"...?\nPhoenix:\nI would like to direct the court's attention to this one area right here!\nJudge:\nWh-What are you pointing to? His ankles...?\nPhoenix:\nIf you could see this person's ankle, that would be one thing... However you can't.\nJudge:\nA-And...? What does that mean...?\nPhoenix:\nThe costumed person in this photo could not have been Mr. Engarde! (Changed from [The 'Nickel Samurai' in this photo could not have been Mr. Engarde!] in the original release)\nJudge:\nWhat is the meaning of this!?\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nI wonder if you would care to elaborate... With actual facts, that is.\nPhoenix:\nLet's take a look at the Nickel Samurai's poster. Please pay particular attention to the area around the bottom of the hakama.\nJudge:\nHis... His socks... You can see his socks...\nPhoenix:\nExactly! However, in this photo... The Nickel Samurai is clearly holding his hakama up just to walk!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nThere is only one explanation for this! The person inside this costume is clearly much shorter than the defendant! (Alright. I think I've turned things around for myself this time!)\nMia:\nThat's curious...\nPhoenix:\nHuh? What is?\nMia:\nEdgeworth is unusually calm today...\nPhoenix:\nThat's true...\nMia:\nHe's just letting the trial run itself -- as if he's only along for the ride.\nPhoenix:\n\"Along for the ride\"...? What do you mean by that?\nMia:\nI can only think that perhaps he doesn't feel under attack at all...\nPhoenix:\n(He doesn't feel under attack!? Then, I haven't damaged his case at all!?) (Changed from [He doesn't feel under attack!? Then, he's not taking any damage!?] in the original release)\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth! Where does this leave us!?\nEdgeworth:\n...\nJudge:\nIf the person in this photo is not Matt Engarde... Then everything the prosecution has tried to prove has become meaningless!\nEdgeworth:\n... Hmm... I thought it would come to this.\nPhoenix:\nWHAT!?\nEdgeworth:\nWright. I have something I want to ask you. I think you have proven that the person inside this costume is not Matt Engarde. In that case... Who IS this a photo of...?\nPhoenix:\n(Who is the person wearing the Nickel Samurai costume?)\nMia:\nDon't stress out over this, Phoenix. It's very simple. What you should be focused on is Edgeworth's attitude, don't you think?\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah... Why is he so calm...?)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. Let's hear your thoughts. Who is the person in this photograph...?\nJudge:\nA-Adrian Andrews...?\nPhoenix:\nIf you want to know who that Nickel Samurai is, it is none other than this woman!\nEdgeworth:\nAnd why would you say it must be Ms. Andrews!? What in the world points you to her? (Changed from [And why would you say it would be Ms. Andrews!? What in the world points you to her?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nFor starters, she's short. And, she can freely move in and out of Mr. Engarde's room. Finally, she had dinner with Mr. Engarde that night.\nJudge:\nAnd how does that all add up?\nPhoenix:\nIt means that it makes it very easy for her to get a certain item. ...A certain knife with Mr. Engarde's fingerprints all over it!\nJudge:\nThe knife that was used as a murder weapon!\nEdgeworth:\nWhy don't you just say what it is you want, Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(I have to do this now! This is my last chance to turn things around!) The defense motions to indict Ms. Adrian Andrews in the murder of Juan Corrida! It was Ms. Andrews who tried to frame the defendant for the crime!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order!! ORDER!! It looks like this trial has hit a most unexpected development! Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nYes, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nThis court is issuing a subpoena for Ms. Adrian Andrews! A verdict cannot be passed without first hearing her testimony!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Alright! This is it...)\nMia:\nThis... is kind of bad for us.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? What do you mean?\nMia:\nIf Adrian Andrews is summoned to court as a witness... It means that the trial will go on for another day.\nPhoenix:\nOne more day...? Ack!! (If I don't get a verdict TODAY, then Maya...!)\nJudge:\nNow then, we shall set Ms. Andrews' testimony for tomorrow...\nPhoenix:\n(Wh-What am I supposed to do!? The judge is about to adjourn the court!)\nEdgeworth:\nI abhor wasting such valuable time...\nPhoenix:\nE-Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor. I request that you please continue with today's trial.\nJudge:\nB-But... We cannot continue due to this unexpected development!\nEdgeworth:\nTsk, tsk. \"Unexpected\" development? I think you underestimate me, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nAnd what do you mean by that...?\nEdgeworth:\nThat Mr. Phoenix Wright would slave his way to subpoenaing Ms. Adrian Andrews is all happening according to plan... Even if Wright was a bit slow to catch on...\nPhoenix:\nWh-Wh-Wh... WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT!?\nJudge:\nWhat is the meaning of your statement, Mr. Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Adrian Andrews is currently waiting in the prosecution lobby... She is the next witness.\nPhoenix:\n...! (Everything... Everything was planned out in advance by that man...?)\nMia:\nSomehow, I knew there was no way Edgeworth would overlook Ms. Andrews... Looks like this battle is far from over.\nEdgeworth:\nExactly.\nJudge:\nVery well. We will call the next witness. However... Before we proceed, we shall take a 10 minute recess. Please prepare your witness in that time, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nJudge:\nThe court will now take a 10 minute recess.\nTo be continued.\nMarch 22, 2:14 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3\nEngarde:\nDude! I can't believe that Adrian... No way! Not cool and collected Adrian Andrews!\nPhoenix:\nShe is your manager. It would have been very easy for her to pull this off. The only person who had easy access to the knife you used at dinner was, well... her.\nEngarde:\nSo after the ceremony, during the break, huh...? I was sleeping like a log the entire time...\nPhoenix:\nSee, she could have also easily planted that blood-covered button in your hakama.\nEngarde:\nHmm... Because she was the one that came to wake me up? ... Then... Dude, you're saying it really was her...?\nPhoenix:\nYes. She is the real killer... She was the one who murdered Juan Corrida.\nEngarde:\nBut... Why!? I thought she was buds with Juan...!\nPhoenix:\nShe has her own agenda.\nEngarde:\nH-Her own agenda!? Wh-What are you talking about?\nPhoenix:\nI'm sure you'll see by the time this trial's over. It'll be alright. I'll get you acquitted by the end of today.\nEngarde:\nGet me a verdict that's refreshing like a spring breeze, OK Mr. Lawyer dude?\nMia:\nPhoenix... You think her motive is related to Celeste Inpax's missing suicide note, right?\nPhoenix:\n...Yes. Ms. Andrews depended on Ms. Inpax for her strength and reason to live. (Changed from [Ms. Andrews depended on Ms. Inpax for her strength and will to live.] in the original release) But then Ms. Inpax suddenly killed herself. It sounds like she left a suicide note, and the person thought to have hidden it...\nMia:\n...Is Juan Corrida, the victim of this murder.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's why I think that Ms. Andrews got close to Mr. Corrida... All to get the suicide note back!\nMia:\nThat sounds plausible... But one thing bothers me.\nPhoenix:\nUm, what...?\nMia:\nWho was it that first told us about their relationship? Better stated, Mr. Andrews' dependency issues with regards to Ms. Inpax...? (Changed from [Better stated, Mr. Andrews' co-dependency with regards to Ms. Inpax...?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n... It was Edgeworth...\nMia:\nIt looks like he's still the one in command of this ship. Don't let your guard down yet.\nMarch 22, 2:25 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3\nJudge:\nCourt will now reconvene. Now then, Mr. Edgeworth, if you please.\nEdgeworth:\nThe prosecution calls the witness subpoenaed by this court. Ms. Adrian Andrews, the person who discovered the crime in Mr. Juan Corrida's room!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is your occupation?\nAndrews:\nI am the manager of the defendant in this case, Mr. Matt Engarde.\nJudge:\nI see. Now then...\nAndrews:\nBefore we begin, Your Honor, I have one request.\nJudge:\nUh, yes, sure. What is it?\nAndrews:\nI'm sure everyone in this room is wondering the same thing, and would love to find out more about my relationship with the victim. After all, it was the topic of a certain weekly \"magazine\" recently...\nJudge:\nAh, no, I have no idea what you mean. I've never even heard of \"Gossip Land\"...\nPhoenix:\n(If the judge was ever a prosecution witness, he'd do all my work for me...)\nEdgeworth:\nAnyway, I was wondering if you could please tell us about your relation to the victim.\nAndrews:\nYes, I was seeing Mr. Corrida. I was also aware of the rivalry that existed between Matt and Juan... But this was a private matter between Juan and myself.\nJudge:\nHmm, so it was a \"fry 'n bait\" matter... or was that \"bait 'n fry\"? Reminds me of fishing...\nAndrews:\nBut I... But I didn't kill him.\nEdgeworth:\nNo one has accused you of that.\nAndrews:\nI think there's someone who would beg to differ. (Changed from [I've got a feeling someone will soon...] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n...!\nJudge:\nI think we all understand your relationship with the victim now, Ms. Andrews.\nEdgeworth:\nVery well then. Witness, please testify to the court about what happened when you discovered the murder that had taken place.\nWitness Testimony\n-- When I Found the Body --\nAndrews:\nIt was time for the show to start, so I went to get Matt from his room.\nAfter that, I went to Juan's room.\nAnd there was his dead body. I... I was in shock...\nWhat I saw was, naturally, the exact same scene as in the crime scene photo.\nI felt as though I was about to faint, so I poured myself a glass of juice.\nJudge:\nYou poured yourself a glass of juice...?\nAndrews:\nYes. Sadly, I didn't remember not to touch things at the scene of a crime... And I disturbed the crime scene by moving this one thing...\nEdgeworth:\nAnd that is when the fingerprints on the wine glass were made, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nI see. Well, Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.\nMia:\nPhoenix. She is one cool and collected customer, and she has the brains to match.\nPhoenix:\nYes... I know.\nMia:\nIn order to catch a person like her, you have to avoid head-on confrontations. You should disrupt her pacing. (Changed from [You should disrupt her pace.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nDisrupt her pacing...? (Changed from [Disrupt her pace...?] in the original release)\nMia:\nShe's the type of woman who is easily thrown off by things inconsistent with her thinking so you have to attack when she least expects it. The instant you let up on your offense is the instant this trial is over. Understand?\nCross Examination\n-- When I Found the Body --\nAndrews:\nIt was time for the show to start, so I went to get Matt from his room.\nAndrews:\nAfter that, I went to Juan's room.\nAndrews:\nAnd there was his dead body. I... I was in shock...\nAndrews:\nWhat I saw was, naturally, the exact same scene as in the crime scene photo.\nAndrews:\nI felt as though I was about to faint, so I poured myself a glass of juice.\nAndrews:\nI was the one who knocked the flower vase over, where it fell onto the guitar case.\nPhoenix:\n(It doesn't sound like there's any glaring contradictions in her testimony just now...)\nMia:\nI warned you earlier that she would not crack so easily. The only way to make her is to...\nPhoenix:\n...Keep on the offensive and not let up.\nMia:\nThe only way you're going to catch her is with some very strong, decisive evidence...\nPhoenix:\n(I have to find something! I just have to! ...For Maya's sake...)\nPhoenix:\nYou testified that you knocked the flower vase over. Is this correct?\nAndrews:\nYes.\nPhoenix:\nAnd are you sure it fell onto the guitar case?\nAndrews:\nI-Is there some problem with what I said...?\nPhoenix:\nIt's not \"some\" problem, it's a \"major\" problem. It's true that the top of the guitar case was wet with water. However, that's exactly what is so strange! Ms. Andrews! You testified that the vase fell onto the guitar case! However! If that was true, the case should have gotten wet on the inside, not the outside!\nJudge:\nTh-That's very true!\nPhoenix:\nFurthermore, there is one other strange thing about this guitar case.\nJudge:\nAnd wh-what is that?\nPhoenix:\nLet's take another look at the crime scene photo. The remains of the vase are scattered on the floor.\nJudge:\nAnd what is wrong with that?\nPhoenix:\nIf the guitar case was open when the vase fell... The glass shards should be INSIDE, not outside the case!\nAndrews:\nAh!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is your point, Wright!? That the case was closed at the time the vase was knocked over? Is that all!?\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nNo. Think back to what Ms. Andrews testified to! She said that other than the vase, she didn't touch anything else!\nEdgeworth:\nNngh...\nJudge:\nYes, that's right... She did implicitly say she didn't touch the guitar case!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nBut... But this whole matter with the guitar case is a dead end! The bright red guitar was found at the studio! It has no bearing on this case at all!\nPhoenix:\n... That may very well be, however... (Argh, the empty guitar case does seem to have no relation to this case, doesn't it...) (Changed from [An empty guitar case does seem to have no relation to this case...] in the original release)\nJudge:\nHmm... It seems that there is no deeper meaning to the guitar case. Well, Mr. Wright? Do you think we need to hear more details about the guitar case?\nPhoenix:\nThe empty guitar case... I believe this is a crucial piece of the puzzle!\nEdgeworth:\nHeh! I can't believe ANYONE would reach for straws like this! But it is you...\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe I'm doing this either...)\nJudge:\nAlright. I'll follow along... For now. Ms. Andrews, please testify to the court about the guitar case.\nAndrews:\nYes, Your Honor.\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Guitar Case --\nAndrews:\nI don't remember too clearly because I was a bit dazed.\nI suppose I must have opened the guitar case... after I knocked the vase over.\nIt's not a big deal though, right? The case was empty after all.\nAs for why I opened the case... Even I don't know.\nJudge:\nHmm... It looks like this really wasn't a very important point.\nEdgeworth:\nThis wastefulness is such a familiar feeling by now that it's almost... comforting.\nPhoenix:\nUm, anyway, I'll just go ahead and start the cross-examination...\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. Using \"anyway\" to change the topic -- a convenient escape for a weak man.\nCross Examination\n-- The Guitar Case --\nAndrews:\nI don't remember too clearly because I was a bit dazed.\nAndrews:\nI suppose I must have opened the guitar case... after I knocked the vase over.\nAndrews:\nIt's not a big deal though, right? The case was empty after all.\nAndrews:\nAs for why I opened the case... Even I don't know.\nMia:\nCome on, Phoenix. We can't afford to let up on her now.\nPhoenix:\nI wasn't planning on letting up, but...\nMia:\nShe's at her weakest now, so this is our chance!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, if we had a weapon to hit her with...)\nMia:\nI'm sure a weapon is hiding somewhere in the Court Record, waiting to be found.\nPhoenix:\nI have your proof right here. This wine glass.\nAndrews:\nThe wine glass?\nPhoenix:\nYou left your fingerprints very clearly on this wine glass.\nAndrews:\nAh...\nPhoenix:\nEven if you took your gloves off when you poured yourself this glass of juice, wouldn't you think it was just a little strange... That you put your gloves back on, just to open the guitar case!?\nAndrews:\nUgn!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order!!\nMia:\nLooks like you hit the nail on the head this time.\nPhoenix:\n...? What do you mean?\nMia:\nI believe that guitar case plays a very important role here.\nPhoenix:\nBut it's just an empty case...\nMia:\nI wonder if it really was empty though...\nPhoenix:\nB-But the guitar... The bright red guitar was at the studio!\nMia:\nPhoenix, drop all of your presumptions. What was in the guitar case was not the bright red guitar.\nPhoenix:\n(You don't mean... it was a bright WHITE guitar!? Wait, that's not right either...)\nJudge:\nHmm, I admit it would be unnatural for someone to do that. So the witness was not wearing gloves, despite the fact that on the case...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor, this is obviously the defense's usual misdirection tactic at work. Steer the court towards an unrelated topic, and lull us all into his misguided...\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nNo, Your Honor! Please recall that Ms. Andrews had testified that the vase \"fell onto the guitar case\"! Which means that the case was closed when the crime took place! However, it is wide open in this photo of the crime scene! I am sure this guitar case has some relation to the murder!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nIf you are so sure, Wright, then I'm sure you can somehow substantiate your outrageous claim, correct!? Please, enlighten us as to why that guitar case has anything at all to do with this murder!\nPhoenix:\nUh...\nJudge:\nCan you do that, Mr. Wright!?\nPhoenix:\nUm, well... Let's suppose for a second... That the bright red guitar was not the only thing that could have been in the case...\nJudge:\nThe bright red guitar not being the only thing...? Y-You don't mean to suggest that a bright BLACK guitar was inside the--\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nSo, you intend to push your theory that the case was not empty!? Is that it, Wright!?\nPhoenix:\nI wouldn't say something I didn't intend to prove!\nEdgeworth:\nDeflate that head of yours! You haven't proven anything yet! Now then, let's have it. What was inside this case at the time of the murder!?\nJudge:\nTh-This is... This is a photograph...!\nPhoenix:\nYes, but what is important is what is in that picture, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nI-In this picture...?\nPhoenix:\nIt doesn't take a genius to see what I mean! What I am proposing is... Inside the guitar case was the Nickel Samurai! The hero's very own costume!\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What!?\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Wright! Explain yourself!\nEdgeworth:\nWright! Are you saying that the witness opened the guitar case to take out a costume!? What insane point would there be to doing something like that!?\nPhoenix:\nThat insane point would be to wear the costume, of course. Ms. Andrews put it on to hide her identity so she could make her escape. After all, you couldn't let anyone see you leave, could you, Ms. Andrews?\nAndrews:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nI-I refuse to accept your theory! Do you have anything to support such a preposterous idea!?\nPhoenix:\nJust outside the door was an investigative photographer who was starving for a big scoop. And in the end, she managed to get this shot, correct?\nJudge:\nYou... You mean this photo!? Order! Ordeeeer! It looks like we've wandered into quite another mess again, haven't we...?\nMia:\nNice job, Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\nWell, you know my strategy. Speak first, think later!\nJudge:\nHmm... So the real murderer was hiding inside a costume...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nW-Wait one second, Your Honor! The Nickel Samurai's costume would have been Mr. Matt Engarde's! Why would something of the defendant's be in the victim's room!? And inside the guitar case, of all places!?\nJudge:\nHmm, true... That is a little baffling... Mr. Wright, the court would like to hear your thoughts. What was this Nickel Samurai costume doing inside the guitar case...?\nPhoenix:\nMr. Engarde did not take his costume off during the break period... In that case, the costume we are talking about was a spare one.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat...?\nJudge:\nThen... are you saying that on the night of the murder... there were TWO Nickel Samurai costumes at the Gatewater Hotel!?\nPhoenix:\nYes, that is what I am saying.\nJudge:\nAnd how do you explain the costume that was inside the guitar case...?\nEdgeworth:\nIt would mean that the victim himself had brought this spare to the ceremony on purpose! (Changed from [It would mean that the victim himself had planned to bring this spare to the ceremony!] in the original release)\nJudge:\nBut... But why!? The victim, Mr. Corrida, was the Jammin' Ninja. Why would he secretly bring the Nickel Samurai's spare costume with him...? What could be the reason behind such a peculiar act?\nPhoenix:\n... And therein lies the sticking point... (Changed from [... Ah, so that's what he intended...] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What are you mumbling to yourself about now!? Have you just been rambling all this time without any sense of inner monologue!?\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? N-No, I just...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, please explain yourself! Why do you think the victim had the Nickel Samurai's spare costume!?\nMia:\nPhoenix... Are you sure you can explain this one? Think carefully before you answer... And then answer with gusto! I believe in you!\nPhoenix:\nAlright. This is what I think. The reason the victim brought the Nickel Samurai's spare costume to the hotel was...\nJudge:\nWhat is this...?\nPhoenix:\nOn the night of the murder, after the stage show, the Nickel Samurai was going to hold a special press conference.\nJudge:\nA press conference...?\nPhoenix:\nYes, the Nickel Samurai was supposed to confess something at this conference.\nEdgeworth:\nI heard about this as well. For once, you're not making something up, Wright.\nPhoenix:\nBut what struck me as strange was that Mr. Engarde himself said he had no idea he was supposed to be holding a press conference that night.\nAndrews:\n...\nJudge:\nBut how can that be!?\nPhoenix:\nThe way I see it, that can mean only one thing: The conference was set up by none other than the victim, Mr. Juan Corrida himself!\nJudge:\nTh-The victim?\nPhoenix:\nYes. The spare Nickel Samurai costume was prepared for that very conference! Mr. Corrida was going to hold the press conference as the \"Nickel Samurai\"!\nJudge:\nHe was going to dress up as the Nickel Samurai and hold a conference!? But why would the victim do such a thing!?\nPhoenix:\nThat's something I don't quite know yet, however... What I am concerned with right now is what he intended to reveal at that conference.\nEdgeworth:\nThe Nickel Samurai was going to \"confess\" something. And by \"confess\", I'd wager he was going to reveal something about \"himself\".\nPhoenix:\nWhich means that Juan Corrida, posing as the Nickel Samurai, was going to speak about Matt Engarde!\nJudge:\nYes, I guess that is what it would mean...\nEdgeworth:\nBut, if that's the case... that's not a \"confession\"! That's \"public disclosure\"!\nAndrews:\nHmph.\nJudge:\nM-Ms. Andrews...?\nAndrews:\nI can see why you are pros at what you do.\nJudge:\nPardon me?\nAndrews:\nYes, just as you say, the press conference was set up by Juan.\nJudge:\nMs. Andrews! Please offer us an explanation for this!\nAndrews:\nI was the one he asked to help set it up. And the person who prepared the second costume for him... That was also me.\nJudge:\nYou...!?\nAndrews:\nJuan had bet everything on the Jammin' Ninja this year. And if he lost the Grand Prix... He was going to make sure Matt was going down with him. That's what he thought anyway.\nJudge:\nHe was going to ruin him, huh...?\nAndrews:\nIt looked like somehow, Juan had in his hands a secret so powerful... that it would destroy Matt's acting career had it been revealed!\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nJudge:\nAnd do you know what this \"secret\" of Mr. Engarde's is, Ms. Andrews...?\nAndrews:\n... That's something only Juan knew. I... I don't know what it is.\nJudge:\nAh... I see.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nAndrews:\nI... I've probably been coming off quite suspicious to everyone, but that's to be expected. I've been trying to protect Matt, after all...\nPhoenix:\nP-Protect Mr. Engarde!?\nJudge:\nAnd yet again another strange bit of truth comes to light it seems... Ms. Andrews, if you could, please tell us the truth about your behavior!\nAndrews:\nYes, Your Honor. I understand.\nWitness Testimony\n-- Protecting Matt --\nAndrews:\nFrom the moment I saw the crime scene, I had a feeling that Matt was the murderer.\nMatt had to kill Juan no matter what.\nAnd he didn't have an alibi for what he was doing at the time of the murder.\nMy thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife...\nBut I'm Matt's manager... So I felt that I had to protect him...\nJudge:\nHmm... This does account for everything...\nAndrews:\nWell... I am the logical type.\nMia:\nWe're finally seeing her true self. She is more nervous than a scared rabbit.\nJudge:\nIf the defense can find no fault with this testimony, I am ready to make a ruling. (Changed from [If there are no objections, I feel that I can pass a verdict based on this testimony.] in the original release) Please keep that in mind as you cross-examine, Mr. Wright. (Changed from [Now then, Mr. Wright, if you please.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like somehow everything has swung to the opposite end of the scale again... That just means I have to put my weight into this and turn her logic upside-down!)\nCross Examination\n-- Protecting Matt --\nAndrews:\nFrom the moment I saw the crime scene, I had a feeling that Matt was the murderer.\nAndrews:\nMatt had to kill Juan no matter what.\nAndrews:\nI know what his motive was. ...But I don't have any way to prove I'm right.\nAndrews:\nAnd he didn't have an alibi for what he was doing at the time of the murder.\nAndrews:\nMy thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife...\nAndrews:\nThat button was torn off of Juan during his fight with Matt.\nAndrews:\nBut I'm Matt's manager... So I felt that I had to protect him...\nPhoenix:\nAs I expected, Ms. Andrews' testimony seems pretty solid.\nMia:\nReally? Because to me, it sounded a little wishy-washy.\nPhoenix:\nWishy-washy? (Well, I guess we'll see if I press a little more...)\nMia:\nYou should know this by now, but you'll need strong, decisive evidence to make her talk.\nPhoenix:\nGot it, Chief! (...I'm going to pin you down this time, Ms. Andrews!)\nPhoenix:\nThis is the victim's autopsy report. It clearly states that the cause of death was \"strangulation by a scarf\".\nAndrews:\nS...Strangulation...\nPhoenix:\nThe knife stab to the victim was done after the victim had already died.\nJudge:\nA-And what does that mean?\nPhoenix:\nLet's examine the evidence. This button has the victim's blood on it. Which would mean that it was ripped off of the costume... when?\nEdgeworth:\nAfter the knife was stabbed into the victim...\nPhoenix:\nExactly! Which means... It is impossible that this button was torn off during the victim's final struggle, because the victim was strangled to death in that fight!\nAndrews:\nAh...\nPhoenix:\nThat's right, Ms. Andrews. There is no way this button was ripped off during the struggle. This button was consciously pulled off of the victim's already dead body!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Wh-What is the meaning--\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is the meaning of this, Wright!? So what if the button was torn off the body after the victim had already died? What does that change!?\nPhoenix:\nLet me ask you one simple question, Mr. Edgeworth. Why was the button torn off? What purpose did that serve?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat \"purpose\"...?\nPhoenix:\nWe now know this button was not torn off during the fight. So the murderer took the time and effort to purposely rip this from the victim's body. That would mean that the murderer had something in mind, wouldn't it?\nEdgeworth:\n...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Does this mean... Does this mean you know what the murderer wanted to do with this button!? What was it!?\nPhoenix:\nThere is only one logical reason for doing something like that. It was to pin the crime on Mr. Engarde!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nThere is no way anyone would put a bloodied button in their own pants! That's right! Mr. Engarde was set up! By the real killer, of course!\nJudge:\nAnd... The real murder is...? Well, Mr. Wright!? Who in the world is the real killer then!?\nPhoenix:\n(Finally... I can't believe I managed to bring this trial all the way up to this point...)\nMia:\nPhoenix... You can't let your guard down yet! Not until the very end!\nPhoenix:\nThe real killer, the person who planned to frame Mr. Engarde is...\nPhoenix:\nMs. Adrian Andrews! I choose you! You are Mr. Corrida's killer!\nAndrews:\nWh-What!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order!! Mr. Wright! This is a very grave matter! Do you have any evidence that supports your charge...?\nPhoenix:\n\"Any evidence\"...? ALL of the evidence points to Ms. Andrews!\nAndrews:\nWh... How preposterous! You can't stick any of that on me!\nPhoenix:\nI can't, can I? Would you care to test me?\nAndrews:\nThen... Then what about this knife!?\nPhoenix:\nThe knife was used to stab the victim after he had already been strangled to death. It was used to throw suspicion onto Mr. Engarde, naturally. A knife covered in the defendant's fingerprints could only be taken from his room. And the only one who had dinner with him, and knew which knife to take, was you.\nAndrews:\n...Tsk! Th-Then! What... What about the button that was found in Matt's hakama!?\nPhoenix:\nThis button was removed from the victim's body after he had already died. The only people who could've done so were the person who found his body or the killer. However, if Mr. Engarde was the real killer, there is no way he would have put such incriminating evidence in his own hakama!\nAndrews:\nUghn...\nPhoenix:\nThe only person who could have put this button into Mr. Engarde's hakama, is the person who went to wake him from his nap... which is you, yet again, Ms. Andrews.\nJudge:\nI... I see... What about the empty guitar case...?\nPhoenix:\nThat is also another piece of evidence that incriminates Ms. Andrews. That costume was used to hide the real killer's identity as they fled the crime scene. Now, who could have known that there was just such a costume inside the guitar case...? It could only have been the person who prepared the costume for the victim. And that person is... you, Ms. Adrian Andrews!\nAndrews:\nN...No... I...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nBut Ms. Andrews' fingerprints were nowhere to be found on the guitar case! And it was you who proved that she was not wearing gloves at the time!\nJudge:\n...! Th-That's right!\nPhoenix:\nThat's because she did not intend on leaving any prints. If anyone had found out that she had touched the case, they would have asked her why. So to avoid leaving any prints, she used a towel or something else to open it. But! The glass of tomato juice is a different story! Ms. Andrews purposefully left her fingerprints on the glass to show that yes, indeed, she was the classic \"dazed discoverer\" of a dead body!\nAndrews:\nAaaaaah!\nPhoenix:\nAnd to top it all off, there is this photo! A photo of the killer as they exited the scene of the crime. No reasonable person on Earth can believe this Nickel Samurai is Mr. Engarde! He would be much too short for his own costume if it was him.\nAndrews:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nSpeaking of how tall people are... Ms. Andrews, you're also kind of short in stature, are you not?\nAndrews:\nP-Please... Stop...\nPhoenix:\nWell, how about it, Ms. Andrews!?\nAndrews:\nUm...\nPhoenix:\n(I've got her this time!)\nAndrews:\n...\nJudge:\nMs. Andrews...?\nAndrews:\n... I... I... I refuse... to testify.\nPhoenix:\nWhat was that...?\nAndrews:\nTh-There's a law... It says I can't be forced to testify about something... if it can incriminate me!\nJudge:\nWell, yes... You are absolutely correct, Ms. Andrews. The law does provide us with a way to avoid self-incrimination... by allowing a witness to not testify if the testimony can cause damage to themselves.\nPhoenix:\nWHAT!? (\"Pleading the fifth\" is not something most people would think to do on the spot! Actually... Thinking back to yesterday in Mr. Engarde's room...)\nvon Karma:\nAdrian Andrews!\nAndrews:\nY-Yes...?\nvon Karma:\nThink hard about what we just discussed. Understood!?\nAndrews:\nA-Alright... ...\nPhoenix:\n(That's it. That's when Franziska planted this idea into her head... She must have told Ms. Andrews to not testify if things looked bad.)\nMia:\nYou did a good job proving everything up to this point, Phoenix. But there is still one thing you haven't done.\nPhoenix:\nSomething I haven't done...?\nEdgeworth:\nHeh heh heh. What's wrong, Wright? Are you finished already? Run out of evidence?\nPhoenix:\n...!\nJudge:\nWhat is so humorous, Mr. Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\nI'm sure you realize this as well, Your Honor... But, everything the good lawyer here has proven up to this point is meaningless.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!?\nEdgeworth:\nEverything you have proven is circumstantial.\nPhoenix:\nCircumstantial...?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, circumstantial. You have yet to provide a single piece of definitive proof. Proof that Ms. Andrews, did in fact, harbor a wish to murder Mr. Corrida!\nJudge:\nM-Ms. Andrews! You... Did you want to kill Mr. Corrida...?\nAndrews:\nI believe this may lead to me incriminating myself, so I will abstain from answering.\nJudge:\nBut Ms. Andrews... If you do that, it would be the same as admitting your guilt, don't you think...?\nAndrews:\nMaybe so, or maybe not. There is nothing to prove it either way. Besides, you don't even know what crime I would be \"guilty\" of due to my silence.\nPhoenix:\n(NO!! She's taking that defiant attitude again!) M-Mia! What should we do...?\nMia:\nSomehow, we've landed in the worst possible situation.\nJudge:\nI think we have reached a certain conclusion at this point in time. Ms. Adrian Andrews has refused to testify. And the defense's theory that she is the actual murderer... has not been fully substantiated with solid, definitive proof.\nPhoenix:\nBut! That's not true!\nJudge:\nIn this situation, there is only one thing this court can do. And that is to declare a recess.\nPhoenix:\nR-Recess...!?\nJudge:\nI request that both the prosecution and the defense look further into this matter. And at tomorrow's trial...\nPhoenix:\n(T-Tomorrow...!? We don't have a \"tomorrow\"! If we don't get a not guilty verdict today, then...)\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nPlease wait, Your Honor! Th...That's not necessary! The trial... Please continue the trial!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat are you sweating for...? Your client is getting one more day to live, isn't he?\nPhoenix:\nThat... That's not it! This isn't about that. Edgeworth! I know you know who the real killer is! Please... Let the trial continue! If I don't get the verdict... then Maya...\nEdgeworth:\n...?\nJudge:\nBut it's impossible to continue as long as the witness refuses to testify. Now then, this court is...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nIt is not impossible for this trial to continue.\nAndrews:\n...!\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth! Wh-What are you...\nEdgeworth:\nIt's true Ms. Andrews holds the right against self-incrimination; however, if the topic of conversation were something unrelated to whatever she may be guilty of, then she has no right to withhold testimony!\nJudge:\nY-Yes, that is very true, but...\nEdgeworth:\nActually, there is one little thing that I'm curious about. Ms. Andrews.\nAndrews:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nWhen you found the victim's dead body, you poured yourself a glass of juice.\nAndrews:\nY-Yes... And...?\nEdgeworth:\nI can't help but think how unnatural that is. Usually when one finds a body, they are shaken up, not stirring a glass of juice.\nAndrews:\nSo my actions were \"unusual\"? But I've already...\nEdgeworth:\nBefore you speak, I want to state that if you have a reason behind your actions, I would like you to testify to that effect.\nAndrews:\nTestify...!?\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor! I would like to request that the witness testify again as to what happened when she first discovered the victim's body! Whatever we find out in this testimony should in no way implicate the witness.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nMia:\nI don't know what it is about Edgeworth today, but I can't get a good read off of him. Is he friend or foe? I just don't know...\nJudge:\nThe court acknowledges the prosecution's request. Ms. Andrews, if you please.\nWitness Testimony\n-- When I Found the Body --\nAndrews:\nThat glass of juice... I didn't really pour it for myself.\nI was surprised when I walked into the room and saw it in that messy state.\nAnd Juan... He was sitting slumped over and tired-looking in the corner.\nWhen I saw him sitting like that, the thought that he was dead didn't cross my mind.\nTo be honest, I thought he had just fainted or something. So I went to pour him some juice.\nWhen I realized that he was dead... That's when I knocked the flower vase over.\nJudge:\nHmm... So you poured that glass of juice for the victim. Why didn't you say so in your earlier testimony?\nAndrews:\n...I didn't think I needed to include something so trivial.\nMia:\nPhoenix. Please be careful here. If you can't find anything wrong with this testimony, then there's nothing left...\nPhoenix:\nI know. (Edgeworth... What the heck is going on in that brain of yours...?)\nJudge:\nNow then, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- When I Found the Body --\nAndrews:\nThat glass of juice... I didn't really pour it for myself.\nAndrews:\nI was surprised when I walked into the room and saw it in that messy state.\nAndrews:\nAnd Juan... He was sitting slumped over and tired-looking in the corner.\nAndrews:\nWhen I saw him sitting like that, the thought that he was dead didn't cross my mind.\nAndrews:\nTo be honest, I thought he had just fainted or something. So I went to pour him some juice.\nAndrews:\nWhen I realized that he was dead... That's when I knocked the flower vase over.\nMia:\n... This is what it all comes down to.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMia:\nThis is the absolute end for both sides... And Adrian is letting her guard down. Phoenix, now is our best chance yet to kill the prosecution's case!\nPhoenix:\n(Isn't that a bit harsh...? Ms. Andrews... Will you tell us the truth this time...?)\nPhoenix:\nSo you honestly didn't think he was dead when you found him?\nAndrews:\nNo, not at all...\nPhoenix:\nEven though this is what you saw when you discovered the body?\nAndrews:\n...Ah!\nJudge:\nWh-What is the meaning of this!?\nPhoenix:\nIsn't it obvious, Your Honor? There is a knife sticking straight out of Mr. Corrida's chest! Anyone who saw this scene would have immediately thought that here was a dead man!\nAndrews:\nAh... Um... That's... Well, you see...\nPhoenix:\nI doubt a single person in the world would mistake this for someone who fainted, and then so nonchalantly go pour something to drink!\nJudge:\nY-Your point is...?\nPhoenix:\nMs. Andrews! Your testimony just now... It was all one giant lie!\nAndrews:\nUngh!\nPhoenix:\nAnd your lie has proven one thing very clearly. That you are the real killer!\nAndrews:\n... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!\nJudge:\nIt looks like the defense has somehow brought the ugly truth to light. The defendant, Mr. Matt Engarde, is not guilty after all...\nAndrews:\nThat... But that's impossible! You're wrong...\nJudge:\nM-Ms. Andrews! Try to have some composure!\nAndrews:\nIt... It wasn't me... It wasn't me, I tell you! It was Matt! I swear it! He's the one who killed Juan!\nPhoenix:\nBut you were the one who refused to testify! And your reason for not doing so was that you \"might\" end up incriminating yourself!\nAndrews:\nTh-That's because...\nJudge:\nMs. Andrews, I will give you one last chance. What exactly are you hiding that may \"incriminate\" you?\nAndrews:\n... I... I... I refuse... to testify.\nJudge:\nThen there is no need for this court to continue any further. Mr. Matt Engarde's innocence has been clearly demonstrated.\nPhoenix:\n(Is... Is it... over...? Have we... Have we found the truth at last...?)\nMia:\nWhat's wrong, Phoenix?\nPhoenix:\nUsually... Well, usually, the real killer confesses his or her guilt. And now that I think about it, this is the first time someone hasn't.\nJudge:\nNow then, I would like to hand down my verdict for Mr. Matt Engarde.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor. The prosecution feels that it would be premature to pass down a verdict at this time.\nJudge:\nWh-What...?\nEdgeworth:\nThe reason is quite simple. This witness has yet to speak the absolute, real truth.\nJudge:\nThe \"absolute, real truth\"...? What are you...?\nEdgeworth:\nWitness... Don't you understand yet?\nAndrews:\n...Huh?\nEdgeworth:\nI don't know who planted this silly idea in your head, but as long as you \"protect\" yourself through your silence, Matt Engarde will go free. And in his place... YOU will become the guilty party!\nAndrews:\n...Th-That's... That's a lie! I... I don't believe you!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat...?\nAndrews:\nI... I was told... If I spoke... If I spoke, then it would be all over... And Matt would never be declared guilty...\nPhoenix:\n(Wh-What in the world is she talking about!? Has she lost it!?)\nAndrews:\nI... I can't speak about it... I'm too scared...\nMia:\nIt's Franziska von Karma...\nPhoenix:\nHuh...?\nMia:\nDon't you rememeber, Phoenix? Ms. Andrews lives by gripping tightly onto the words of another. Because she doesn't have the strength to believe in herself.\nPhoenix:\nTh...Then, right now... Ms. Andrews is...\nMia:\nYesterday, she was tossed a life-saver by Ms. von Karma. \"Don't say a word, no matter what happens. If you do, Matt Engarde will be acquitted.\" Ms. Andrews undyingly believes in those words right now, and is clinging onto them...\nPhoenix:\n(Th-Then what should we do!? This... This is the first time I've ever come across anything like this! But Ms. Andrews has to be the killer, right!? All we have to do now is... is get our not guilty... That is my only priority!)\nAndrews:\nIt wasn't me! I'm begging you, please believe me! I didn't kill Juan! Help... Please... Someone... Help me...!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nThe court can't continue on like this, therefore I'd like to hear what you intend to do.\nPhoenix:\n(What I intend to do...!? Wh-What am I supposed to do!? What am I supposed to say!?)\nEdgeworth:\nWright! I suggest you think very carefully about this! Think about what this witness did, and what she did NOT do! And think about who is the real mastermind behind this crime!\nPhoenix:\n(Who's the real mastermind? Isn't that obvious!? There's no one else it could be except the woman crying over there! ...Right?)\nEdgeworth:\nCome now! What will you do!? What kind of man are you, Mr. Phoenix Wright!?\nJudge:\nThat's enough! I commend you for trying, Mr. Edgeworth. However, it's clear that the defense's theory is the truth.\nAndrews:\n...Y...You're wrong...\nEdgeworth:\n... What a shame... (Changed from [Such a shame...] in the original release)\nAndrews:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nI had hoped things wouldn't come to this, however...\nJudge:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Andrews. Since you absolutely refuse to testify... It falls on my shoulders to disclose this to the court.\nAndrews:\n...S...Stop...\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\nThis witness... How should I put this... She has an illness.\nAndrews:\nWhat!?\nEdgeworth:\nAnd because of this illness, she has tried to commit suicide in the past.\nAndrews:\nS-Stop... Please stop...!\nEdgeworth:\nNo matter how much you want to hide it, it's no use. I have the evidence right here.\nAndrews:\nAh! Th-That's...!\nPhoenix:\n(That's the second part of the suicide report -- the attempted suicide report!)\nEdgeworth:\nWhat will you do now, witness? You know what I am about to do, don't you? I will now reveal to the court, the true nature of the pitiful woman known as Adrian Andrews!\nPhoenix:\n(The secret of her dependent nature... (Changed from [The secret of her co-dependant [sic] nature...] in the original release) Having other people know about it scares her more than anything else in the world...)\nAndrews:\nPlease! Please STOP!! I beg you!! If people find out... If people find out... I... I'll...\nEdgeworth:\nIf you're going to say you would \"choose death\", that is of no concern to me.\nAndrews:\n...!\nPhoenix:\n(Edgeworth... How can you be so cold...!?)\nEdgeworth:\nHowever, before you die... I will pull the truth from your still-breathing lips! (Changed from [I will pull the truth from your breathing lips!] in the original release) ... No matter what I have to do.\nAndrews:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nSo, will you tell the court yourself, or shall I!? Either is fine with me.\nAndrews:\n... ... ...I... I'll talk. But please... Help me... N-Nothing matters anymore...\nWitness Testimony\n-- My \"Crime\" --\nAndrews:\nWhen I first saw him... I really thought he had fainted. Honest.\nWhen I realized he was dead... That was when I formulated my plan.\nOnce I made sure there was no one in the hallway, I made a dash back to Matt's room.\nAnd then... I stabbed Juan's dead body with the knife, and ripped off the button.\nJust when I finished and was returning to Matt's room... I had a bit of an inconvenience.\nAnd that's why... That's why I ended up using the Nickel Samurai costume.\nJudge:\nS-Stabbed the body!? With the knife!? But why would you do that!?\nAndrews:\nIsn't it obvious? To pin the blame on a certain person... A certain cowardly man!\nJudge:\nWh... What do you mean by all of this...?\nEdgeworth:\nIt might take this court a little while to understand, but... This is the truth.\nAndrews:\nThe real killer is Matt! That scumbag of a man! I'll never forgive him! He's trying to escape his guilt again! Just like last time!\nPhoenix:\n(\"Last time\"...?)\nEdgeworth:\nSo, Ms. Andrews stabbed the victim, Juan Corrida, in the chest with the knife. However, she didn't do it with murder in mind. She did it with the intent of framing Matt Engarde for the murder... And this! This is her \"crime\"!\nPhoenix:\n(Wh-WHAT!? How is this possible!? I mean... Wasn't Ms. Andrews supposed to be the real murderer!?)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. Please get over your shock and commence the cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- My \"Crime\" --\nAndrews:\nWhen I first saw him... I really thought he had fainted. Honest.\nAndrews:\nWhen I realized he was dead... That was when I formulated my plan.\nAndrews:\nOnce I made sure there was no one in the hallway, I made a dash back to Matt's room.\nAndrews:\nAnd then... I stabbed Juan's dead body with the knife, and ripped off the button.\nAndrews:\nJust when I finished and was returning to Matt's room... I had a bit of an inconvenience.\nAndrews:\nAnd that's why... That's why I ended up using the Nickel Samurai costume.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't want to concede, but this testimony... it rings of the truth...)\nMia:\nI'm sorry, Phoenix...\nPhoenix:\nN-No, please, don't apologize to me. We were both taken by surprise.\nMia:\nStill, I'm sorry...\nAfter pressing all statements:\nJudge:\nI think we've heard enough! So, after that, you went back to Mr. Engarde's room and planted the button?\nAndrews:\n...Into Matt's hakama? Yes. After that, I folded up the costume I was wearing and put it into a bag. Then I snuck it out of the hotel and got rid of it.\nJudge:\nM-My word... What does all this mean...?\nAndrews:\n...Mr. Edgeworth, is it?\nEdgeworth:\n...\nAndrews:\nThe real criminal... is Matt Engarde!! Yesterday... That woman prosecutor sat me down for a talk...\nPhoenix:\n(Franziska, huh...)\nAndrews:\nShe said that I should, under no circumstances, confess to what I had done. That if I just kept quiet, then Matt would be found guilty for sure... I... I had no choice but to believe in her words...\nPhoenix:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n...\n...............\nJudge:\nWhat this witness has done is clearly unlawful. However... As long as her testimony stands, we can be certain she is not the real killer!\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait, Your Honor! The defense still...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nWright.\nPhoenix:\n!\nEdgeworth:\nIt's pointless. At this point in time, it is not possible to indict Ms. Andrews on anything.\nJudge:\nYes, exactly. There isn't a single piece of evidence that points to her as the murderer. The cross-examination of this witness is over. And so is today's trial. You couldn't establish that the witness was the culprit. Please let it go, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nB-But!\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth, please place Ms. Andrews under arrest for further questioning.\nEdgeworth:\nUnderstood, Your Honor. The prosecution will arrange for her detention immediately.\nJudge:\nThat's all. Court is adjourned for today!\nPhoenix:\n(Today's... Today's trial... It's over...! And I didn't win an acquittal!)\nEdgeworth:\nWitness... Would you mind if I asked you something?\nPhoenix:\n...! (Edgeworth...?)\nAndrews:\nWhat is it...?\nEdgeworth:\nBefore you leave court today, I wondered if I might look at one thing. The card in your hand. It's had my interest for quite some time now. What exactly is it...?\nAndrews:\nOh, this...? Mr. Wright also asked about this. Although I didn't remember at the time you asked me about it, Mr. Wright, I remembered just now. I found this in the room on that day.\nPhoenix:\n\"The room\"...?\nEdgeworth:\n\"That day\"...?\nAndrews:\nYes. I found this card when I discovered Juan's body. It was lying there right next to him...\nPhoenix:\nYou found that card... next to the victim's body?\nAndrews:\nI suppose I must have unconsciously slipped it into my pocket... ...But it's not as if this card has any relevance to Juan's murder, right?\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, I guess not. But it's still a strange card, if you ask me... But as far as a clue to this case...? I don't see why...)\n???:\nEdgeworth:\nWitness! That card... Give it to me! Hurry!\nPhoenix:\nE-Edgeworth...?\nEdgeworth:\nDo you have any idea what you have stupidly, yet inadvertently done!? This... I can't believe you hid this from me all this time!\nAndrews:\nI... I didn't mean to...\nMia:\nWh-What is this all about...?\nPhoenix:\n(I've never seen Edgeworth so emotional before... (Changed from [I've never seen such an emotional Edgeworth in my entire life...] in the original release) That card... What in the world is it?

Time ???Location: ???\nMaya:\nHeh heh. I guess even kidnappers can be a little clumsy. Clumsy enough to drop a card like this for me. And even though he said he was an \"assassin\", I bet he's just making that up, like how Nick does with everything in court. Anyway, let's try out the card trick with this card I just found...\n...*click*...\nMaya:\nSounds like I got the door open... OK! Time to go take a look around!\nDate: ??? Time ???Location: ???\nMaya:\nWh-What is this place...? I've got a feeling I'm not in the hotel anymore... Are those videos over there? ...Well, I'll worry about that later.

I cannot have you wandering around at will.\nMaya:\nEeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\n???:\n...It seems... that your Mr. Wright is truly concerned about you.\nMaya:\nHe is...?\n???:\nFor now, I would suggest you remain cooperative.

You mean...\n???:\n\"Dead men tell no tales\" is how the saying goes, correct?\nMaya:\n\"D-D-D-D-Dead\"!?\n???:\nI'm almost certain I told you on our first meeting.

Oh, yeah, there's a message here for you.\nPhoenix:\nA message...?\nJailer:\nIt's from Matt Engarde. ...Ah, here you are.\nPearl:\nWhat did he write!? Is it something really important...?\nPhoenix:\nI don't know. Well, let's see what it has to say... \"To Mr. Lawyer dude, I've got something really important to tell you.\" (Changed from ['To the lawyer dude. I've got something really important to tell you.'] in the original release) (Why do I feel uneasy all of a sudden...?)\nEngarde:\n... ... Oh, Mr. Wright. So actually... I have a favor to ask of you. I have this cat named Shoe. I didn't put out a lot of food when I left the house, so he's probably pretty hungry. You think you could drop by my house and feed Shoe for me, dude? My house is just a little ways down from the hotel, alright?\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nTh-This is terrible! Let's hurry! We have to feed his cat! I'm sure poor Shoe's stomach is growling by now!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, I guess...\nMatt's Note jammed into a pocket.\nPhoenix:\n(A client's request is a request...

So what is \"electromagnetic interference\"...?\nGumshoe:\nIt's something that happens when a radio wave gets mixed up with another signal, pal.\nPhoenix:\nOh, when you put it that way...\nPearl:\nI don't understand what you're talking about...\nGumshoe:\nLike for example, when a cell phone goes off next to a computer screen, the stuff on the screen gets kinda fuzzy and starts acting funny, right?\nPearl:\nHuh? ...\"Kom-pu-ter\"?\nGumshoe:\n... Um, it's like when you use the dryer next to the TV, and the screen starts looking weird.\nPearl:\nO-Oh, yes, the TV does do that! Hmm... Oh, so that's what you're talking about!\nPhoenix:\n(She seems amazingly happy at being able to understand this...)\nGumshoe:\nSo the room you were in when that interference to the transceiver happened... There's gotta be something there that's sending out very strong radio waves, pal! Something like... Hmm... Like a listening device or something.\nPhoenix:\nAh!\nGumshoe:\nHey, speaking of that! Where were you when it happened?\nPearl:\nWe were in Mr. Corrida's room... The scene of the murder!\nGumshoe:\nWhat!? That's it! I'm going to sneak into the precinct and get a bug sweeper!

We need that item!\nGumshoe:\nHey, hey, calm down, pal. I didn't say I didn't get one, just not the police's.\nPearl:\nWow... So this is a \"bug sweeper\"...\nPhoenix:\nIt looks a little... broken.\nGumshoe:\nHey, this was made when I was in elementary school, pal.\nPhoenix:\nOh? By who?\nGumshoe:\nMe, of course! Ah, seeing this sure brings back memories...\nPhoenix:\n...\nGumshoe:\nHey, don't look down on it, pal! Sure, it looks a little beat up... (Changed from [Hey, don't look down on it, pal!

Trust me, pal, it'll do the job! But...\nPhoenix:\nBut...?\nGumshoe:\nBut you can't set the sensitivity... So it's going to beep at anything that gives off electromagnetic waves.\nPearl:\nBut isn't it better that way?\nGumshoe:\nOh ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho! Well, anyway, since I brought it all this way, might as well give it a whirl, right pal?\nPhoenix:\n(I'm getting that sinking feeling again...)\nGumshoe:\nOK, now I'll tell you how to use this baby! There's a listening device or some other sort of bug hidden in this room, pal.\nPearl:\nSo we're going to find it, right?\nGumshoe:\nRight. Now, first, let's turn the sweeper on. Next, move the sweeper around to give the room a real thorough lookie-see, pal.

A perfectly normal stuffed bear with some really strong radio waves... Sounds like you found the device to me, pal. Let's dig this big fella's eye out and see what we've got.\nPearl:\nN-No! You can't! Such... Such a violent act...\nGumshoe:\nOomph! *rip!*\nPearl:\nNoooooooooo!\nGumshoe:\n...\nPhoenix:\nTh-That's!\nGumshoe:\nIt's a miniature camera... And it looks like there's more.

You are one lucky man, Wright.\nPhoenix:\n?\nEdgeworth:\nDo you know this stuffed bear, little girl?\nPearl:\nUm... I have no idea!\nEdgeworth:\nHmph... Of course not. The maker of this bear is a very expensive, luxury brand from overseas. It's completely hand-made, and only a small number of these are exported here.

Mr. Nick, can he really?\nPhoenix:\nW-Well, I guess so...\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... It's 9 PM. I think I can still make it in time.\nPhoenix:\n?\nEdgeworth:\nI'll be taking this for now.

All I know is nothing that has anything to do with you is ever good! Like just now. I was handed this strange device for who knows what reason.

But the request came from Edgey-poo, so...\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth...?\nOldbag:\nAnd he said,\nEdgeworth:\n\"If you feel angry, direct your anger at that unsophisticated lawyer.\"\nOldbag:\nSo, I'm going to feel free to direct all my anger towards you!\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh...

I'll be back at the office really soon!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What's wrong!?\nGumshoe:\nSomething really unexpected just happened! Mr. Edgeworth... He...\nPhoenix:\n(Edgeworth...?)\nGumshoe:\nAnyway, hurry up and get back to the office, pal! I don't know what's going on anymore! It's no good! The end! I --\nPhone:\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\n...Hello? He got cut off.\nPearl:\nWh-What's going on, Mr. Nick!?\nPhoenix:\nGumshoe said we need to go back to the office right away.\nPearl:\nTh-Then we should hurry back!\nPhoenix:\n...I'm scared to go back.\nPearl:\nWhat are you talking about!? Mr. Nick! Pull yourself together!\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nPowers:\nMaybe it'll be good news!\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow, I doubt that...)\nMarch 22Wright & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nWell? What happened?\nGumshoe:\nWe got 'em! We know who bought that spy camera!\nPearl:\nEh!?\nPhoenix:\nTh-This quickly?\nGumshoe:\nAnd this bear's what gave them away, pal!\nPhoenix:\nThe bear...\nGumshoe:\nI figured it out, pal! I figured that we should've been looking into the bear instead of the camera!\nPearl:\nUm... Wasn't that Mr. Edgeworth that figured...\nPhoenix:\nShh, Pearls. ...And? Go on.\nGumshoe:\nThere's only one person who bought one of those bears who's related to this crime!\nPearl:\nWh-Who is it!? Who would be so rude as to spy on another person in their room...?\nGumshoe:\n...Matt Engarde.\nPearl:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nMatt Engarde. Your client, that's who, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(And here I thought things couldn't get any worse...)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nGumshoe:\nI know you don't want to give up, pal...\nPhoenix:\n(I never thought... I didn't think it was possible... The person who put the spy camera in Juan Corrida's room was Matt Engarde!)\nPearl:\nWhy... Why would Mr. Engarde do something like this!?\nGumshoe:\nI bet it was to catch Ms. Andrews and Mr. Corrida in one of their rendezvous.\nPhoenix:\n\"I bet\" is not good enough for me. I have to know the absolute truth behind this camera.\nGumshoe:\nAre you going to see him? Mr. Engarde, I mean.\nPhoenix:\nYes.\nPearl:\nI'm... I'm scared, Mr. Nick. I wonder... I wonder what we will find out next...\nPhoenix:\n(I'm scared myself, but I have to put on a good face for Pearls... Matt Engarde! What in the world have you done!?)\nCorrida's Hotel Room\nDetention Center (after clearing all Talk options in Wright & Co. Law Offices)\nEngarde:\nYou're working really late, you know. It's already past 10:00 PM, dude.\nPhoenix:\nI think it's time you told me the truth.\nEngarde:\n... Relax. Don't you know that \"ignorance is bliss\"? But if you really want to know, let's talk.\nAfter breaking Matt Enguarde's Psyche-Locks, then clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\n...\nEngarde:\nWhat's wrong, Mister Lawyer? You've grown awfully quiet...\nPhoenix:\nH-How could I have been so deceived by you all this time? When we first met, I asked if you had killed Juan Corrida... And you answered very clearly that you hadn't killed anyone.\nEngarde:\nHey now. I never told you any lies. The person who did the killing was that De Killer guy, right? All I'm guilty of is taking a catnap in my room.\nPhoenix:\nYou... You... You killed Mr. Corrida!\nEngarde:\nHahaha. I dare you to say that in court tomorrow.\nPhoenix:\nGrr...\nEngarde:\nAww, but too bad. You can't. You're my lawyer, after all. Aren't you?\nPhoenix:\n...\nEngarde:\nYou could always drop my case and refuse to represent me. How does that sound? Aww, but you can't, can you? That would be the one thing you absolutely can't do.\nPearl:\nM-Mystic Maya...!\nEngarde:\nYou wouldn't want to test De Killer. He's a man of his word, or so I hear. You could end up getting a certain friend of yours rubbed out if you lose.\nPhoenix:\n...Y...You... scoundrel...\nEngarde:\nSo if I were you, Mr. Wright, esquire, I think I would give it my all tomorrow. Remember, everyone likes a happy win-win resolution.\nPhoenix:\nI... I'll get you for this!\nEngarde:\nThat's such a cliché phrase. Juan said something just like that, if memory serves. Of course... Well, we all know how well things turned out for him, don't we? Good night, Mister Lawyer.\nPhoenix:\n(Maya... Maya, what am I supposed to do!?)\n???:\n... And now... Now you've finally found it.\nEdgeworth:\nThe starting line of this case.\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth...\nEdgeworth:\nI don't care for the horrid atmosphere here. Let's return to the precinct.\nMarch 22Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept.\nEdgeworth:\nWell, Wright? What are you going to do? If you plan on changing your defense...\nPearl:\nN...No! We can't do that...\nEdgeworth:\nThat's right... He's holding Maya hostage...\nPhoenix:\n... What... What should I do...?\nEdgeworth:\n... That's not something I can answer for you.\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Edgeworth...\nEdgeworth:\nWright... Only you can decide where to go from here. One year ago... At that time, I didn't truly understand what a \"prosecutor\" was. And that is why... I had to leave the Prosecutor's Office. I felt that I couldn't stand in a court of law until I knew what a prosecutor really was. And now, Wright... It's your turn.\nPhoenix:\nMy... turn?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this thing called a \"lawyer\"? What can you do as one? You must find the answer... And you must find it on your own.\nPhoenix:\nPeople like you and Franziska von Karma are always using all you have to pin me down. You fight to the very end, even when you know the truth is not with you. But I'm not like you. I can't fight for a false verdict -- for a man I clearly know to be guilty!\nEdgeworth:\n... Franziska... She fights for herself. The only thing she fights for is her perfect win record. That's all.\nPhoenix:\nAnd!? Isn't that the same as you!? Isn't that why you ran away a year ago? Because your precious win record was destroyed!? You are so petty!\nEdgeworth:\n... I see... Now I understand why you despise me so. However, you are mistaken.\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you...?\nEdgeworth:\nThanks to you, when you sealed off my path to a perfect win record... I began to realize the error of my ways. I realized that things such as a perfect record were meaningless.\nPearl:\nWhat!? (Changed from [Eh!?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nI don't believe you. Are you saying that is why you left the Prosecutor's Office? But then, why? Why are you here now?\nEdgeworth:\nThe answer to that... is something you will find out on your own. I have faith you will see it before the verdict is read tomorrow. But if you can't, then you will be powerless to change the ending of this story.\n...*beep beep beep*...\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick! The transceiver!\n...*beep*...\n???:\nI'm sorry for what happened earlier. Well then, Mr. Attorney. Do you wager you can obtain an acquittal tomorrow?\nPhoenix:\n...\n???:\nMy, my. What is the matter, Mr. Attorney? I don't sense your usual anger this time.\nPhoenix:\n...Tell me. Please. Why are you holding Maya hostage for Mr. Engarde's sake? Why are you... Why are you doing this for that cold-blooded killer!?\nEdgeworth:\nWright...\n???:\n... Please don't misunderstand things. He is my client.\nPhoenix:\nDon't toy with me! A man who hires an assassin is just as much of a killer himself!\n???:\n... ...I believe you were asking me for a reason as to why I am doing what I am...\nPhoenix:\n...Y-Yeah.\n???:\nThis is what I like to call my \"aftercare\".\nPhoenix:\nWh-What the heck is \"aftercare\"?\n???:\nMy name carries a certain amount of honor and dignity, Mr. Attorney. I take great care to insure that no suspicion falls upon my clients for my handiwork. That is what is called \"client relations\" and it is a part of an assassin's duty.\nPhoenix:\nAn assassin's... \"duty\"...?\n???:\nWe were unlucky this time and my client was arrested as a suspect. As a result, I did what I had to do to enlist your expert help, Mr. Attorney. And to ensure that you would do everything in your power to the very end.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What is your name!?\n???:\nI believe I told you once before, however...\nPhoenix:\nYou did... But...\n???:\nMy name is... De Killer. Shelly de Killer.\nEdgeworth:\nY-You're Shelly de Killer!?\nde Killer:\nPlease keep in mind you do not have much space to maneuver with me. As a De Killer, I always finish what I set out to do. If you fail to keep up your end of the bargain...\nPhoenix:\nM-Maya!\nde Killer:\nIt would be my duty as an assassin to see to it she receives a nice long nap.\nPearl:\nAaaaaaaaaaah! Noooooooooooo!\nde Killer:\nNow then, if you'll excuse me. If someone were to trace this signal back to me, it would be quite troublesome.\n...Meow.\n...*beep*...\nPearl:\nMystic Maya! Mystic Mayaaaaa!\nEdgeworth:\nI... I don't know what to say...\nPhoenix:\n...Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nHm?\nPhoenix:\nDid you hear that? At the end of that transmission...\n...Meow.\nEdgeworth:\nHuh? Oh, that... It sounded like a cat.\nPearl:\n...A cat?\nPhoenix:\n(It can't be... that cat... Can it...?)\nPearl:\nWhat is it...?\nPhoenix:\nI think... I know where Shelly de Killer is holding Maya hostage! Edgeworth! Have all police units head for Engarde Mansion immediately!\nEdgeworth:\n...! Alright. You hurry over as well, then!\nPhoenix:\nDon't lose hope yet, Pearls! The fight has only just begun!\nPearl:\nY-Yeah!\nDetention Center (after breaking Matt Engarde's Psyche-Locks, then clearing all Talk options in Detention Center - Visitor's Room)\nPhoenix:\n(Now then, whose story do I want to hear?)\nMarch 22Engarde MansionLiving Room\nPhoenix:\nMaya!\nPearl:\nPlease answer us! Mystic Mayaaaa!\nEdgeworth:\nWe have this area completely surrounded. There is no way for him to escape. Assuming he's still in the area...\nPhoenix:\nI can't believe it... That butler... All this time, he was De Killer...\nEdgeworth:\nHe and Engarde were working together all this time. I'm sure they had worked out a contingency plan ahead of time.\nPearl:\nOh, it's a figurine of a bear! But there are a lot of cuts in it for some reason...\nFigurine added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nA bear...? Isn't that more of a thing for Mr. Corrida? Why would something like this be here...?\nEdgeworth:\nWright, look down. There's a little pet door installed here.\nPearl:\nAh, I'm sure that's for Shoe...\nPhoenix:\nDo you think that this... came through that little door...?\nEdgeworth:\nUmph! This door... It's locked!\nPhoenix:\nWell, I'm pretty used to breaking doors down by now. Let's go, Edgeworth!\n*SLAM* *SLAM* *CRASH!*\nPrivate Lounge\nPhoenix:\nArgh! There's no one here!\nEdgeworth:\nFrom the looks of this room, I would say this is Engarde's private lounge. ...Look at this, Wright!\nPhoenix:\nAn antennae for sending and receiving radio signals and a VCR... Check inside the deck! If there's a tape, it would be an important piece of evidence! (If we're lucky, it'll have the moment the crime was committed recorded on it!)\nEdgeworth:\n... I'm sorry, but... The tape deck is empty. There's no tape to be found.\nPearl:\nNo...\nEdgeworth:\nBut there's no mistake that someone used this to record something. It looks like someone took the tape we're looking for, and escaped with it...\nWine Cellar\nPhoenix:\n... (We've searched all over, but it looks like he got away...)\nEdgeworth:\nI'm sorry. It looks like he slipped out of our grasp this time.\nPhoenix:\nAnd now... we've lost our only lead.\nEdgeworth:\nDon't give up yet. That little girl is looking to you to be her pillar.\nPearl:\n...\nPhoenix:\n...Yeah, you're right.\nEdgeworth:\nWe're close, I can tell. We've already set up checkpoints along every route leading out of this district. Leave the rest to us.\nPhoenix:\n(Maya...)\nPhoenix:\nThis looks like a picture of Ms. Inpax... (\"With love... Celeste\")\nPearl:\nMs. Inpax? You mean...?\nPhoenix:\nYes, Mr. Corrida's former manager.\nPearl:\nWhy would a picture of Ms. Inpax be here in Mr. Engarde's mansion?\nPhoenix:\n(And why does it say, \"With love\"...? Hmm, this might be a clue...)\nCeleste's Photo added to the Court Record.\nPearl:\nAh!\nPhoenix:\nWhat's wrong, Pearls?\nPearl:\nP-Please let me see that picture frame!\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? What's so special about the frame?)\nPearl:\nOn the back... There's something written on the back of the frame! ...\"Maya\" It's Mystic Maya! She left us a message!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!?\nMaya:\nI thought you'd come. I knew you would. Now listen up! You'd better get Engarde a guilty sentence, OK!? If you get that creepy slimebag a not guilty, I'll never forgive you, ever! I'm fine, so you don't need to worry. ...There's so much I want to write, but I don't think I have a lot of time left. Pearly, you're there too, right? Make sure you help Nick, OK? Someone's gotta watch out for the helpless lunk. ... Um... That's it for now, Nick. I guess I'll talk to you guys later.\nPearl:\n...That's... I... Nooooooooo! Mystic Mayaaaaaaa... *sob*\nEdgeworth:\nWright!\nPhoenix:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nWhat's wrong? Why the blank stare?\nPhoenix:\nOh, um, nothing.\nEdgeworth:\nWe've searched the house, and this is the last room. It looks like he eluded us.\nPhoenix:\n...Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nYes?\nPhoenix:\nAs far as clues go, I think this is about all I'm going to get.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nBut I'm still short one last thing...\nEdgeworth:\nAnd what is that?\nPhoenix:\n(Ms. Andrews' Psyche-Lock... If I could just find out what secret she's holding... Then I think I stand a chance in court tomorrow... To blow this case wide open and expose the truth.)\nEdgeworth:\nI think I know what you're thinking. I'll contact the detention center.\nPhoenix:\nUm... Thanks, Edgeworth. Well, let's go Pearls. It's time to open that last lock.\nMarch 22Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nAndrews:\nGood evening, Mr. Wright. ... What's wrong? You look ill...\nPhoenix:\nMs. Andrews. I have come to remove your Psyche-Lock.\nAndrews:\nPsyche-Lock...?\nPhoenix:\nI want to know, and you will tell me... ...your secret.\nAndrews:\nFine, go ahead. Try to break me, if you can.\nAndrews:\nI'm sure even you can guess why Juan called the wedding off, right? Matt \"confessed\" to Juan... about his relationship with Celeste.\nPhoenix:\nI see... So that's what happened.\nPearl:\nBut... Then why did Mr. Corrida have to call off the wedding!? I don't understand at all...\nAndrews:\nIt was probably because of his worthless male pride. Juan and Matt were always fierce rivals. Matt waited for the wedding announcement and then unleashed the truth on Juan. He was aiming for when it would hurt Juan the most.\nPearl:\nPoor Ms. Inpax!\nAndrews:\n...That wasn't the end of it. That day, I'm almost certain that Celeste left a suicide note behind. And in that note, she left a detailed account of Matt's various misdeeds, and... So that she would never again be hurt by Matt, she chose... to die. Then, when Juan discovered her body, he hid her note.\nPearl:\nB-But why would he do that!?\nAndrews:\nIt's simple. Juan realized that note was a powerful weapon against Matt. And it would be especially damaging to his \"refreshing like a spring breeze\" image. In any case... With his pride hurt, Juan sought revenge.\nPhoenix:\nRevenge... There's that word again.\nAndrews:\nJuan wanted to publicly disclose the contents of that suicide note. At a time that would cause Matt the most damage, of course.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that was at the press conference after the stage show...\nAndrews:\nI know all about it, because I heard it all from Juan. It was so I could find out about all this that I drew close to Juan to begin with. They're quite a pair of hideous monsters, aren't they? Even Celeste's death was something for them to use in their game. That night, when I found Juan's body, it was only natural that I thought the murderer was Matt. Those two were always spying on one another, after all. As for me, I was frantically searching for Celeste's suicide note. I wanted to destroy it before it ever went public. I was going to burn it. I had even brought a lighter. But... I couldn't find the suicide note... And that's when revenge crossed my mind. Yes, I was going to bring to them my own kind of cruel revenge. Celeste was killed by those two monsters. So when I stabbed Juan's body with that knife... I didn't feel a single shred of guilt.\nPearl:\n...!\nAndrews:\n... And that's all I have to say.\nPhoenix:\n...\nAndrews:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Even knowing all this, are you still going to help that... \"man\"?\nPhoenix:\n... I... I'm a lawyer...\nAndrews:\nI see. What a foul profession.\nPhoenix:\n... Thank you very much for your time and for talking with me.\nAndrews:\nIt was no big deal. I couldn't sleep anyway.\nPhoenix:\n(I can't sleep either... Not with Maya's situation... or with what I know now...)\nTo be continued.\n\nPhoenix: \n...*huff*...*huff*... Grr!! How did I get into this mess...?\nThat's far enough! You can't run forever, Mr. Phoenix Wright!\nPhoenix:\nWha...!? What have I done wrong!?\nI cannot allow you to go on like this!\nPhoenix:\n...? B-But I'm just a simple defense attorney!\nSilence!

Then, you have some sort of lead...!?\nGumshoe:\nSorry, but right now we've got zero leads on the guy... But we're not going to give up!\nPhoenix:\nGumshoe...\nGumshoe:\nUntil the trial is over... until the verdict is handed down, we're going to do everything we can and find De Killer! If we can get Maya out, then you can get Engarde the guilty verdict he deserves, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(That's true, I could do that if they found Maya first...)\nGumshoe:\nYou got that!? So you have to do whatever you can to make the trial last longer!\nPhoenix:\nI have to make the trial last longer?\nGumshoe:\nIf you go at Mr. Edgeworth with everything you've got, then you two can draw it out!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, now I get it...)\nGumshoe:\nI believe in you, pal!

Gumshoe will come through, I know it!)\nMarch 23, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3\nJudge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Matt Engarde.\nPhoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.\nEdgeworth:\nThe prosecution has been ready for a while, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nNow, as I recall, we concluded yesterday's session with a big mystery on our hands. The mystery being what exactly was Ms. Adrian Andrews' role in this murder? That is to say, is she really connected to the crime itself? Mr. Edgeworth, if you would please inform the court of today's proceedings.\nEdgeworth:\nAdrian Andrews. She forged evidence that threw suspicion onto Mr. Engarde, and then proceeded to escape the crime scene by wearing a Nickel Samurai costume. The guilt of these actions are those from which she cannot escape.\nJudge:\nHmm, then you're saying that she is guilty after all...?\nEdgeworth:\nI'm not finished, Your Honor. Ms. Andrews has nothing to do with committing the actual murder.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nI would like to direct the court's attention to this card.\nJudge:\nWhat is that...? It looks like a shell...\nEdgeworth:\nThis is the calling card of a certain assassin.\nJudge:\nA-Assassin, you say!?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, Juan Corrida was killed by a professional assassin! And the person who hired the assassin, his client so to speak, is Matt Engarde!\nJudge:\nWh-What a surprising turn of events!\nEdgeworth:\nI would think it's become commonplace by now, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\n(I know what's going on this time... So I know that everything Edgeworth has said is true...)\nMia:\nBut we still have to hold out as long as we can. At least, until Maya's safe and sound.\nPhoenix:\nI wonder how the trial will turn out today...?\nJudge:\nNow then, please call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nThe prosecution calls the defendant's \"mentor\", Mr. Will Powers to the stand.\nEdgeworth:\nNow then, witness. Your name and occupation, please.\nPowers:\nO-OK. I'm... Uh... Will Powers. I'm a poor, underpaid action star...\nEdgeworth:\nAnd what is your relation to the defendant?\nPowers:\nWell, that's... I guess I'm sort of a lousy mentor to him in a way. Yeah.\nJudge:\nUm, Mr. Powers. Please... You don't need to put yourself down so much.\nPowers:\nOh, uh, sorry. Well, but I'm just kind of a nothing sort of guy.\nEdgeworth:\nOn the night of the murder, you visited the defendant's room. Is this correct?\nPowers:\nY-Yes.\nPhoenix:\n...! (I... I didn't know that...)\nPowers:\nUm, but you know... I didn't actually get to see Matt when I went...\nEdgeworth:\nAll you need to do is answer what you're asked. Now then, I would like you to please testify about when you went to Mr. Engarde's room.\nPowers:\nO-OK... Sure...\nWitness Testimony\n-- Visit to Matt's Room --\nPowers:\nAfter the award ceremony, I went by myself to Matt's room.\nMatt was standing there in front of his room, still in his Nickel Samurai costume.\nHe was talking with someone. At first, I thought it was the bellboy.\nI watched the two of them for a while, but then I gave up and went back.\nI had guests with me that night, and I couldn't make them wait for me.\nJudge:\nHmm... Nothing sounds out of place in Mr. Powers' testimony.\nPhoenix:\n(And talking with the bellboy is no big deal...)\nEdgeworth:\nIf one assumes that the person Mr. Engarde was speaking with was an ordinary bellboy...\nJudge:\nWh-What are you implying?\nEdgeworth:\nWell, Mr. Wright. Let's have your cross-examination, shall we?\nMia:\nLooks like we're in another sticky situation.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMia:\nA trap. Can't you smell it, Phoenix? But for us to find out more, we're just going to have to charge in head first, right?\nCross Examination\n-- Visit to Matt's Room --\nPowers:\nAfter the award ceremony, I went by myself to Matt's room.\nPowers:\nMatt was standing there in front of his room, still in his Nickel Samurai costume.\nPowers:\nHe was talking with someone. At first, I thought it was the bellboy.\nPowers:\nMatt gave the bellboy a tip.\nPowers:\nI watched the two of them for a while, but then I gave up and went back.\nPowers:\nI had guests with me that night, and I couldn't make them wait for me.\nMia:\nDo you remember this incident? Did Mr. Powers leave his seat that night?\nPhoenix:\nI don't remember that happening at all. Maya was making such a racket in her hyper state... I ended up focusing on her.\nMia:\n...I see. In any case, from his story, he probably wasn't gone for very long.\nPhoenix:\nThe defendant is a huge star. He can afford to give generous tips, wouldn't you agree?\nPowers:\nUm, sure. But giving him that much was maybe a little too much, I think...\nPhoenix:\n(\"A little too much\"...?)\nEdgeworth:\nWould you please clarify for the court, about how much would you say the defendant gave to the bellboy?\nPowers:\nHonestly, I don't know. I can't even begin to guess.\nJudge:\nAnd why is that?\nPowers:\nBecause he gave the bellboy a really, really fat roll of cash.\nPhoenix:\nA ROLL OF CASH!?\nJudge:\nAh, well... How interesting... That certainly was a very generous tip, wasn't it?\nEdgeworth:\nA very fat roll of cash... That can hardly be called a \"tip\", Your Honor!\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\n(The judge is beginning to look awfully suspicious of us...)\nJudge:\nHmm, so supposing that roll of cash was not a tip... Then what was it?\nEdgeworth:\nPayment, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nJudge:\nPayment...?\nEdgeworth:\nIsn't it obvious? For the murder of Mr. Juan Corrida.\nJudge:\nThen... Then the bellboy the witness saw...\nEdgeworth:\nYes, he was the assassin.\nJudge:\nH-Hold your horses now! Mr. Edgeworth, you don't have any proof of this... do you?\nEdgeworth:\nHave I ever been unprepared to support my claims, Your Honor? I have here, the card Shelly de Killer left at the scene of the crime.\nJudge:\nShelly... de Killer...\nEdgeworth:\nHe is the person the police's special investigations team has been chasing for ages. I am certain that the person the witness saw was this very assassin, Shelly de Killer!\nPowers:\nR-Really!?\nJudge:\n...? What's wrong, Mr. Powers?\nPowers:\nNo, nothing. Something just clicked in my head and I think I just figured something out!\nJudge:\nOh?\nPowers:\nActually, I saw that bellboy again later on that night!\nPhoenix:\nWHAAAT!?\nJudge:\nMr. Powers! Please testify! Tell us what you saw!\nPowers:\nYes, sir! Right away!\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Second Time --\nPowers:\nThis time, I was in that hallway because I had to go to the bathroom!\nAnd that's when that bellboy I saw earlier came out of the room!\nOf course, when I say \"room\", I mean Juan Corrida's room!\nNow that I think about it, that bellboy did seem kinda out of place!\nYeah! So he had to be the assassin! I'm sure of it!\nI mean...\nEdgeworth:\nThank you very much. That is all we need for now.\nPowers:\nHuh? But I'm not done. There's still more...\nEdgeworth:\nLet us first establish that the bellboy was truly Mr. de Killer. Then we shall see.\nJudge:\nHmm... So the bellboy came out of the victim's room... And if that bellboy really was the assassin... Then, I think the answer is fairly obvious.\nEdgeworth:\nThat would be correct, Your Honor. Well, Mr. Wright. I believe it's your turn... to entertain and make us laugh.\nPhoenix:\nHa. Ha. Ha. Ha.\nMia:\nThis is no laughing matter!\nCross Examination\n-- The Second Time --\nPowers:\nThis time, I was in that hallway because I had to go to the bathroom!\nPowers:\nAnd that's when that bellboy I saw earlier came out of the room!\nPowers:\nOf course, when I say \"room\", I mean Juan Corrida's room!\nPowers:\nNow that I think about it, that bellboy did seem kinda out of place!\nPowers:\nI thought it was kinda strange for a bellboy to come out of a guest's room empty-handed!\nPowers:\nYeah! So he had to be the assassin! I'm sure of it!\nMia:\nIn any case, if that bellboy was the assassin, it would be very bad for us.\nPhoenix:\nBut... he really is the assassin, you know?\nMia:\nYes... But. You can't give in yet. If you want to prolong this trial for as long as possible, you're going to have to pull some cheap tricks on this one.\nPhoenix:\nMr. Powers.\nPowers:\nY-Y-Yes?\nPhoenix:\nYou're easily influenced by other people's words, aren't you? As soon as you heard that the bellboy might have been the killer, you got caught up in believing it must be true.\nPowers:\nBut... But... Isn't he really suspicious!? He's got all those stitches, and... and...\nPhoenix:\nSo? A baseball has stitches! Are you saying all baseballs are suspicious because they have stitches!?\nPowers:\n*gulp!* Well, there's also... I mean, what about him being empty-handed!?\nPhoenix:\nI would like to ask the court to please take a look here.\nJudge:\nThis is... the crime scene...\nPhoenix:\nThere is a wine glass sitting next to Mr. Corrida's body. The liquid inside this glass is tomato juice. And now, if you would look at what is on top of the table in the lower right corner here... Anyone can clearly see that it is a tray with a bottle of tomato juice on it! The bellboy had just brought this to Mr. Corrida's room. He left the tray in the room, which is why he was empty-handed when he left!\nPowers:\nAah!\nJudge:\nB-But! That would mean that the bellboy had seen and left a dead body in the room!\nPhoenix:\nAh, but can you prove that Mr. Corrida was already dead at that time?\nJudge:\nUh... M-Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\n...Yes?\nJudge:\nI-I blame you for leading me down this route!\nEdgeworth:\nHeh heh heh. I'm terribly sorry...\nPhoenix:\n(What is with him? Why is he laughing??)\nEdgeworth:\nWitness. Isn't there one more thing you would like to share with us?\nPowers:\nI-Is there?\nEdgeworth:\nThe bellboy was empty-handed... Or should I say empty-\"hand\"ed? I recall you had something interesting to say about his hands...\nPowers:\nOh yeah! I almost forgot!\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Wh-What...?\nPowers:\nThat bellboy -- he was wearing gloves!\nPhoenix:\nGloves?\nPowers:\nYeah, pitch black, leather ones. All the other bellboys don't wear gloves like that, right?\nJudge:\nBlack leather gloves... Why didn't you mention them earlier!?\nPowers:\nS-Sorry... It slipped my mind.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh! Boy does this make the bellboy look really suspicious... Alright, got to focus. I can't get lax here!) So what if he had gloves? A lot of bellboys wear gloves!\nPowers:\nCome on, Mr. Wright! That bellboy was wearing black leather ones!\nPhoenix:\nSo? A football is made of leather! Are you saying all footballs are suspicious because they are made of leather!?\nPowers:\n*gulp!*\nJudge:\nBut that man... He received a large roll of cash from the defendant. And then he was seen leaving the crime scene wearing black leather gloves. I don't think that even someone like myself can believe he was just another bellboy...\nPhoenix:\nUrgh...\nEdgeworth:\nIt seems that we have finally come to an understanding... Now then, witness. Please continue with the rest of your testimony.\nPhoenix:\nThe rest...?\nJudge:\nOh yes, please tell us more.\nPowers:\nOK!\nWitness Testimony\n-- Their Second Meeting --\nPowers:\nAfter leaving Juan's room, the bellboy went and knocked on Matt's door, just like that.\nHe gave something to the person inside the room.\nThen the old guy just left, without even going into the room.\nAfter that, I went to the bathroom and then back to my seat.\nJudge:\nSo the bellboy, after leaving the crime scene, next went to the defendant's room...?\nPowers:\nYeah. I kinda saw all that by accident...\nPhoenix:\n(Some accident! I'd say you saw too much! And all of it was suspicious to high heaven...)\nJudge:\nHmm... I think it's safe to say that we can no longer consider this bellboy to be \"normal\". Now then, let's get started, shall we? Mr. Wright, your cross-examination, please.\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor...\nCross Examination\n-- Their Second Meeting --\nPowers:\nAfter leaving Juan's room, the bellboy went and knocked on Matt's door, just like that.\nPowers:\nHe gave something to the person inside the room.\nPowers:\nIf I saw it again, I could say for sure, but I think it was some sort of wooden statue.\nPowers:\nThen the old guy just left, without even going into the room.\nPowers:\nAfter that, I went to the bathroom and then back to my seat.\nPhoenix:\nWell, Mr. Powers' testimony just now was just as vague as his first.\nMia:\nIt's a little troublesome, isn't it? But I'm sure if you press him enough, everything will become clearer. Although, that just makes it harder on us, doesn't it?\nPhoenix:\nUgh... Talk about a lose-lose situation.\nPhoenix:\n...\nPowers:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nJudge:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nWhat was the point of that pregnant pause!?\nJudge:\nWhere did that objection come from!? Well, speak up!\nPhoenix:\nUh, it was me, Your Honor...\nMia:\nWhat is it, Phoenix?\nPhoenix:\nI have a feeling that something bad is going to happen once I show this...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! If you have something to say, please spit it out!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor. (OK Phoenix, deep breath...) Mr. Powers. The \"something\" you saw... Was it this item?\nPowers:\nOh, hey! That's it! That's the something! Wow, Mr. Wright. You really figured it out.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm, I recall we found this at Matt Engarde's mansion...\nJudge:\nAt the d-defendant's house!? What does this mean!?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's simple, Your Honor. Shelly de Killer assassinated Juan Corrida in his room. And then he stole this wooden bear from the scene of the crime.\nJudge:\nThen, the bear being found at Mr. Engarde's mansion would mean...\nEdgeworth:\nIt goes without saying, Your Honor. Mr. Matt Engarde is De Killer's client!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order! ...I said ORDER!!! Mr. Wright. This is a most unfortunate turn of events for you.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... Sorry, Mia.\nMia:\nNo, it's alright. Your judgment was sound. Actually, I figured the bear would come up. If not now, then it would have later on. Even if you hadn't shown it to the court, I'm sure your friend Edgeworth would've.\nPhoenix:\n(Ah, I almost forgot that he knew about it too...)\nJudge:\nHmm... I think it is clear that there is no need for us to continue this trial.\nPhoenix:\n(I... I can't let this happen! I have to do something... There has to be something we've overlooked!) Your Honor! A minute, please!\nJudge:\nY-Yes, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nThere are still a few points left that we have not fully explored!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat are you trying to pull!?\nJudge:\nOh... Well, we can't have that. Alright, Mr. Wright. What questionable point would you like to explore further?\nJudge:\nI think we've heard enough. We now know why this bear figurine was at the defendant's mansion, as well as who it was that received the bear from the assassin in his room... Everything has become very clear. The client who hired the assassin to commit the murder was Mr. Matt Engarde! ... I see no reason for this trial to continue. Therefore, I will now hand down my verdict!\nEdgeworth:\nThank you, Your Honor, for your understanding. You see, Mr. Wright? You could not win against the truth, could you?\nPhoenix:\n... (I knew it would turn out this way... After all, what Edgeworth has stated is the truth...)\nJudge:\nAny last objections, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(Well, do I...? What should I do...?)\nJudge:\nI will now announce my ver--\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\n(There is only one way for me to drag this trial out... The only thing I have left is this one dirty trick...) Your Honor. Right now, we have these two reasons to believe my client is a client of the assassin. Reason number one. He accepted the bear figurine from the assassin. Reason number two. That very same figurine was found at Engarde Mansion. However! It's possible this is all the work of a certain other person!\nJudge:\nWhat are you saying...?\nPhoenix:\nWhat I am saying is, it's possible a different person is De Killer's real client!\nJudge:\nThe \"real\" client...?\nPhoenix:\nYes.\nEdgeworth:\nTsk, tsk. Is this all you have?\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\nNow then, Mr. Wright. Let's hear your theory. Who do you say is De Killer's real client, and therefore, the real murderer? (Changed from [Who do you say is the real client of De Killer, and therefore, the real murderer?] in the original release)\nJudge:\nAdrian Andrews...!?\nPhoenix:\nYes. We already know that she tried to frame Matt Engarde for the crime... By wearing a spare Nickel Samurai costume!\nPowers:\nAh! Then... Then the \"Nickel Samurai's arm\" that I saw...\nPhoenix:\nThat could have very well been Ms. Andrews!\nJudge:\nBut what about Mr. Engarde?\nPhoenix:\nIf you would please recall yesterday's testimony, the defendant was taking a nap during the break period.\nJudge:\nThat's right... Then... finding this figure at Mr. Engarde's mansion...?\nPhoenix:\nIt was a well-laid trap set by Ms. Andrews.\nJudge:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPowers:\n...\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth... What is your opinion on this?\nEdgeworth:\n... I can't even begin to count the flaws in the defense's logic. Besides which, there is no evidence to support it. However... I can't fully discount its possibility either.\nJudge:\nHmm...\n...What is with this trial...?\n...Come on. Anyone can tell Engarde did it...\n...I can't believe the defense would go so far as to pin the guilt onto someone else...\n...Yeah! Unbelievable! It's not something petty; it's murder of all things...!\nPhoenix:\n(This is to save Maya... This is to save Maya... Even if the whole world turns against me, this is one fight I can't give up on!)\nMia:\n...\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order! All disruptive parties will be forced to leave the courtroom!\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor. ... For the benefit of the defense, I'm willing to play along with his \"what if\" game.\nJudge:\nHis \"what if\" game, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nThe prosecution is prepared to challenge the defense's theory.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Wright. Even you must have thought it strange and wondered, \"Why would the criminal want this little wooden bear...?\"\nPhoenix:\n(He's right... De Killer did specially bring that bear to Engarde right away...) Why do you ask? Is there something special about it?\nEdgeworth:\nAbsolutely. And I'm sure that once the court knows its significance, the true killer's identity will become crystal clear. Your Honor! The prosecution calls upon a witness who will clear all doubts against Ms. Andrews.\nJudge:\nAnd who would that be!?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's quite simple, Your Honor. Ms. Adrian Andrews herself.\nJudge:\nI see... Well then, the court will take a short 10 minute recess. The prosecution will prepare its witness in that time.\nEdgeworth:\nYes, Your Honor.\nMarch 23, 11:54 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3\nEngarde:\nHahaha... Oh, I knew it was a good idea to hold her hostage. Don't you agree, Mister Lawyer...? But I never thought in your desperation, you'd try to pin the guilt onto Adrian!\nPhoenix:\n... (Aaaargh! I swear this demon will pay...)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nP-Pearls? Where's Mia?\nPearl:\nI... don't know... A really strong power suddenly called her away...\nPhoenix:\n(A really strong power...?)\nPhone:\n...\nPearl:\nOh, Mr. Nick! Your phone is...\nPhoenix:\n(It's from Gumshoe!)\nPhone:\n...*beep*...\nGumshoe:\nHow is it going!? Have you been hanging in there, pal!?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, sort of... We just barely found something to latch onto.\nGumshoe:\nPhew. That's good, pal.\nPhoenix:\nAnd what about you!? Anything yet!? Have you figured out where De Killer and Maya are!?\nGumshoe:\nUm, uh... We still don't have any leads, but...\nPhoenix:\nWHAT!? We don't have any more time!\nGumshoe:\nIf we just had one! Even a single clue would be really helpful...\nPhoenix:\n(I was only able to come this far because I kept thinking to myself... I've got to keep the trial going until Maya's been rescued... But have I just run out of luck this time...? Is all our hope for naught...?)\nA tent!\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? A tent!?)\nI could see a circus tent!\nPhoenix:\nM-Mia!\nMia:\nIt looks like Maya was unconscious until just a few minutes ago. As soon as she woke up, she called for me.\nPhoenix:\nSo it was Maya that called you away!\nMia:\nShe's locked in a dusty little room right now. But I could see a circus tent outside the window about 300 feet away!\nPhoenix:\nGumshoe! Is there a circus in town right now!?\nGumshoe:\nThere's only one, pal! The Berry Big Circus!\nPhoenix:\nMaya is somewhere within a 300 feet radius of the main tent!\nGumshoe:\nWh-What!? ... OK, hold on a sec, pal! Hey! Draw a circle on that map! About a 300 feet radius from the main tent! Hurry!\nMia:\nAnd...\nPhoenix:\nAnd?\nMia:\nI could see a mailbox under the window.\nPhoenix:\nGumshoe! There's also a mailbox!\nGumshoe:\nHmm... OK! What else?\nPhoenix:\nWhat else, Mia!?\nMia:\nI'm sorry, but it was a very small window. I couldn't see anything else... It felt like I was in an old office building... Maybe the third floor or so...\nGumshoe:\nI heard her! An old office building. Good stuff, pal! OK, just hang in there! Just a little longer, pal! Wish us luck!\nPhoenix:\nGood luck!\nGumshoe:\nI'll call you later, so don't let your battery die, OK pal!?\nPhone:\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\nMia! Maya's not hurt, right!?\nMia:\nShe's in a pretty bad state, Phoenix. She's being starved.\nPhoenix:\n(Gumshoe! Please hurry!!)\nMia:\nLooks like we're out of time. Are you alright, Phoenix?\nPhoenix:\n(It's only a matter of time before Maya's rescued... I can do this! I just have to make this trial last a little longer!)\nMarch 23, 12:05 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3\nJudge:\nCourt will now reconvene.\nEdgeworth:\nDe Killer, the man who murdered the victim, handed this to his client. From this, one obvious question arises. \"Why this particular item?\" I believe the answer to that question will provide us with the name of the real culprit. (Changed from [I believe the answer to that question will provide us with the name of the real criminal.] in the original release) Now then, the prosecution calls the defendant's manager, Adrian Andrews, to the stand!\nEdgeworth:\nCurrently, the witness is accused of tampering and obstruction of justice.\nAndrews:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nHowever, you have been called to the witness stand today to ascertain... who exactly is guilty of murder.\nAndrews:\nI understand.\nEdgeworth:\nVery good. Now, have you ever seen this bear before, Ms. Andrews?\nAndrews:\nOf course I have.\nJudge:\nYou have seen it before?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's right. It's only natural that the witness has. Ms. Andrews. Could you please enlighten the court to this bear's secrets?\nAndrews:\nAlright.\nPhoenix:\n(Why... Why does she...??)\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Bear Figurine --\nAndrews:\nActually, this is an elaborate puzzle.\nIf you know the correct order, it can be taken apart one piece at a time.\nAt its center is a small cavity, with just enough room to store a small item.\nBecause of its complexity, if you don't know the order, you can't open the bear.\nYou really can't tell that it's a small \"jewelry box\" just by looking at it.\nJudge:\nSo this figurine... it's a container of sorts, is it...?\nAndrews:\nYes. Looks can be deceiving, wouldn't you agree?\nJudge:\nYes. This is superb craftmanship. ...Oh, yes, I nearly forgot. You may begin your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.\nMia:\nIt looks like there really was something to that bear after all.\nCross Examination\n-- The Bear Figurine --\nAndrews:\nActually, this is an elaborate puzzle.\nAndrews:\nIf you know the correct order, it can be taken apart one piece at a time.\nAndrews:\nAt its center is a small cavity, with just enough room to store a small item.\nAndrews:\nBecause of its complexity, if you don't know the order, you can't open the bear.\nAndrews:\nYou really can't tell that it's a small \"jewelry box\" just by looking at it.\nMia:\nWe don't know anything about this figurine. So we should try to find out more for now.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I'll keep pressing her for more information.\nAfter pressing all statements:\nPhoenix:\n(I think this is about all I'm going to get for now...)\nFigurine updated in the Court Record.\nEdgeworth:\nWell, Mr. Wright? I think even you have come to realize...\nPhoenix:\n...?\nEdgeworth:\nThat there is one very important fact we have uncovered, and that is this: This bear is actually a \"jewelry box\".\nJudge:\nHmm...\nEdgeworth:\nNow that we have agreed to this point, there is only one logical question that can come next. And that is this: What is inside this box?\nJudge:\nWhat's inside!?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's right. That's what we are going to find out next. Witness.\nAndrews:\nYes?\nEdgeworth:\nYou are the only one who can open this. Please...\nPhoenix:\n(There's a painful silence hanging over the courtroom... All eyes are on Ms. Andrews now as she solves the puzzle, and takes the bear apart...)\n...*click*...\nAndrews:\nI've opened it. Is this what you wanted?\nJudge:\nWh-What is that? It looks like a... note...\nEdgeworth:\nI don't think we need to guess at what that is... Do we, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nIt's the suicide note.\nJudge:\nThe suicide note?\nEdgeworth:\nThe suicide note left by Juan Corrida's former manager, Celeste Inpax. Until now, no one knew of its whereabouts... But just as we suspected, it was hidden. Hidden by the victim, Juan Corrida himself. It seems Celeste Inpax had very beautiful handwriting. And she just as beautifully signed her own name on this document. This is most definitely the note she left right before she committed suicide!\nJudge:\nO-ORDER! Witness! Did you know about this...?\nAndrews:\n...Yes, I did. I heard all about it from Juan. When I discovered his body... I looked for the bear. I wanted to destroy the note before it became public. But... I couldn't find it anywhere.\nEdgeworth:\nBecause it had already been taken by De Killer.\nMia:\nEverything is going at Mr. Edgeworth's pace... So now that the suicide note has been found, what's the next logical question?\nPhoenix:\n\"What is written on the note...?\"\nMia:\nThat's right... At least, that's what I would think...\nEdgeworth:\nNow then, I believe it is only appropriate the contents of this note be made known.\nAndrews:\nI can't stop you, can I...? I went through so much... just to get my hands on it. And I was going to burn it... for her sake.\nEdgeworth:\nI'm deeply sorry, but I can't allow you to persuade me to stop. Your Honor. If you could please read the contents of this note aloud.\nJudge:\nVery well...\nPhoenix:\nThe judge's voice rang loud and clear though the dead silent courtroom... In her note, Celeste Inpax left to us a record of all that had happened to her... About being used and then thrown away by Engarde... About being engaged to Corrida, and Engarde's role in destroying that... And about how she decided, in her despair, to end it all.\nJudge:\n... And that's all Ms. Inpax had to say.\nEdgeworth:\nThere is one thing I would like to say here. The prosecution has no interest in slandering Mr. Engarde.\nJudge:\nThen... What...?\nEdgeworth:\nOur intention, Your Honor, is to establish a motive for murder. Isn't that correct, witness?\nAndrews:\nYes... On the night of the murder, Juan was going to make the contents of the note public. After the post-ceremony show... he was going to hold a press conference.\nJudge:\nMy word...\nEdgeworth:\nMatt Engarde values, above all else, his \"refreshing like a spring breeze\" image. Which is why he had to stop this note from being made public... At any cost!\nCeleste's Suicide Note added to the Court Record.\n...It's Engarde's fault that woman killed herself...\n...And this time, he even went so far as to kill someone to stop him from revealing that!\n...How terrible...! What a selfish person...!\nI guess there are slimeball lawyers out there who will defend these creeps too!\nEdgeworth:\nThere is no room for doubt here. (Changed from [There is no margin for doubt here.] in the original release) Mr. de Killer's client's goal was to obtain this suicide note. And the only person who needed this note that badly is the defendant. Let's not forget that the bear with the note inside was found at the defendant's house!\nJudge:\nIt seems that we have come to the truth at last. The defendant's motives were entirely selfish. He deserves no sympathy from anyone!\nPhoenix:\nUrk... (How am I supposed to escape from this one!?)\nMia:\nWhy the hesitation, Phoenix? Gumshoe hasn't called yet, so you know what you must do.\nPhoenix:\n(I know. I have to carry on and buy him some more time! OK. There are 2 deadly pieces of evidence: the figurine and the suicide note. Maybe somehow, I can find a way out of this situation through one of those!)\nMia:\nThe gavel is already in the judge's hand! Phoenix! Hurry!\nPhoenix:\n(The suicide note or the figurine!? Which one of these should I pursue??)\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order! Y-You make a valid point, Mr. Wright! Mr. Edgeworth! What is your opinion!?\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(It was just a flash, but I think I did rather well on this one...)\nMia:\nUnfortunately... I think he believes differently.\nEdgeworth:\nI believe a show of appreciation is in order.\nJudge:\nH-Huh?\nEdgeworth:\nThe defense seems to be in love with wishing more despair upon itself.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nI would like to direct the court's attention to this.\nJudge:\nWhat is that...?\nEdgeworth:\nIt is a very small video camera, Your Honor. This type of camera is commonly used as a means of spying.\nJudge:\nS-Spying...?\nPhoenix:\n(What the...!? I thought that spy camera was in my possession...)\nEdgeworth:\nMatt Engarde and the victim both thought of the other as their biggest rival. They even went so far as to use this type of item to find each other's weaknesses!\nJudge:\nAnd...?\nEdgeworth:\nThe victim, Juan Corrida, was being spied on! His personal life was being watched by none other than Matt Engarde!\nJudge:\nOrder! Oooooorder!! Ahem! Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nYou... Don't tell me you knew about your client's spying activities!?\nPhoenix:\nWell... sort of...\nJudge:\n\"Sort of\" is not an acceptable answer, Mr. Wright!\nEdgeworth:\nI see you are confused, Mr. Wright. You're probably thinking, \"But I have the camera that was in the stuffed bear's eye...\"\nPhoenix:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nBut this camera that I have is not that same one. Last night, I searched the victim's house on a hunch... Using this...\nPhoenix:\n(Gumshoe's bug sweeper...)\nEdgeworth:\nBy the way, Mr. Wright. The defendant's fingerprints were found on this camera.\nJudge:\nMatt Engarde's fingerprints were on there!?\nMia:\nWell, Phoenix... It looks like those cameras were hidden all over the place, huh?\nPhoenix:\n(What am I supposed to say to that evidence...?)\nEdgeworth:\nI think this is the end. It's fairly obvious that Mr. Engarde learned of the suicide note through this. He was watching the victim all along.\nPhoenix:\n(He got me good this time! I don't have anything to counter that!)\n...Hey, hey... Now what's that lawyer thinking...?\n...Mommy? Is that man the bad killer guy?\n...Shush! Stop! Don't look at him!\n...The way he's sweating is just so... Eww... Nasty...\nMia:\nPhoenix...\nPhoenix:\nYes, Chief!?\nMia:\nHave you figured out what you're going to do next yet?\nPhoenix:\nWhat I'm going to do next!? (Does running away like a frightened child work?)\nMia:\nI know it seems like Mr. Edgeworth is very close to putting the lid on this case. But... In his eagerness to prove his point, he forgot one very important thing.\nPhoenix:\nWell, what is it, Mia!?\nMia:\nThere is a piece of evidence that he really should investigate.\nPhoenix:\n(Something he should investigate?)\nMia:\nI would really hate to see the good prosecutor get scolded... For not remembering to look into the item when he had the chance.\nPhoenix:\n(Why are you speaking in riddles all of a sudden...?)\nJudge:\nAlright, I think this time we finally understand everything. Well, Mr. Wright? You don't have any further objections, do you?\nPhoenix:\n(What is this piece of evidence that Mia is talking about...? Can I figure out what it is that still needs to be looked at, or should I let it go...?)\nPhoenix:\n...I have an objection, Your Honor.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. That was about the weakest objection I've ever heard, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! The defense has no intentions of letting this go so easily!\nJudge:\nYou are beginning to sound desperate...\nPhoenix:\nThat's just your imagination, Your Honor! Mr. Edgeworth. This is not like you at all.\nEdgeworth:\n...?\nPhoenix:\nIn your eagerness to prove your point, you've forgotten one very important thing.\nMia:\nHey... Isn't that what I just said!?\nEdgeworth:\nSo, you're telling me that I forgot something?\nPhoenix:\nYou're so close, Mr. Edgeworth... But there's something you really should examine about this piece of evidence!\nJudge:\nThat is... Ms. Inpax's suicide note, right?\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Who knows?\nEdgeworth:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nI mean, sure, this \"suicide note\" was found inside this bear. But this bear was in my possession until a few moments ago. Which means... The handwriting on this \"suicide note\" has yet to be analyzed!\nJudge:\nOh...\nPhoenix:\nSo! As to whether this pivotal piece of evidence was really written by Ms. Inpax or not... That has yet to be even remotely confirmed! (Changed from [Has yet to be even remotely confirmed!] in the original release)\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Wright! You can't seriously be suggesting...\nAndrews:\nMr. Wright! You... Are you saying this suicide note is a fake!?\nPhoenix:\nMs. Andrews... You were the one who tried to pin this murder on Mr. Engarde. Who's to say you didn't create a fake \"suicide note\" and put it into this bear!?\nAndrews:\nH-How dare you!?\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor. The defense is indiscriminately accusing the witness again! There is no evidence linking the witness to the suicide note whatsoever!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nBut if this is a fake, then the witness is the only person who could have made it!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat!?\nPhoenix:\nRecall the witness's testimony concerning this figurine! The only person other than the victim who could solve the puzzle is the witness herself!\nAndrews:\nAhh!\nPhoenix:\nMs. Andrews! You wrote this note, didn't you? You wrote it so you could use it to frame Matt Engarde!\nAndrews:\nI... I did no such thing!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nWright! If you're going to pronounce this suicide note a fake... Then show this court some evidence to support your theory!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nMr. Edgeworth! You were the one who presented this scrap of paper as evidence! That means the burden of proof lies with you, the prosecution!\nEdgeworth:\nUuugn!\nJudge:\nThat's enough! Mr. Edgeworth. Can you confirm the handwriting on this suicide note...?\nEdgeworth:\nIt is as the defense has stated! The handwriting has yet to be analyzed!\nJudge:\nIf that's the case... It seems that yet again we have reached a point where a verdict is impossible.\nEdgeworth:\nImposs... That's impossible!\nMia:\nThis isn't good, Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\n(The judge is going to carry this trial over one more day. I don't think Maya will physically be able to make it another day!)\nJudge:\nI didn't want to have to do this, but I don't have a choice. I request that both the prosecution and defense further investigate...\n...Handwriting analysis my butt! That's just the lawyer trying to buy more time!\n...Engarde is guilty! Look, any idiot can tell you that!\nMia:\nI think we've reached the end of the line...\n...Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!... ...Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!... ...Guilty! Guilty!

And what's with that sigh!?) Where's Maya!? What happened to De Killer!?\nGumshoe:\nHe, uh... He got away...\nPhoenix:\nWHAT!?\nGumshoe:\nI'm sorry, pal! I really am! I don't know what to say besides I'm sorry. I wish there was some way to make it up to you! I really do!\nPhoenix:\nA-Anyway, what's going on!?\nGumshoe:\nWe found his hideout, pal. But... the two of them were already gone...\nMia:\n...This is terrible...\nGumshoe:\nI'm going to keep looking for them, pal. Don't you worry! I just need a little more time!\nPhoenix:\nBut...\nGumshoe:\nDon't tell me we don't... we don't have any more...\n...Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!... ...Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!... ...Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!...\nPhoenix:\nDo you hear that? They're calling for his head!\nGumshoe:\nMr. Wright... I can't... For us to come this far and... ... Oh!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What is it!?\nGumshoe:\nLet me talk to Mr. Edgeworth!\nPhoenix:\nI-I can't do that!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Would you please get a hold of yourself!?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nI am about to end today's proceedings. You may take your phone calls after...\nPhoenix:\nHold on, Your Honor! Edgeworth! Catch!\nPhoenix:\nGumshoe:\nMr. Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\n...\nGumshoe:\nPlease! You've got to buy us some more time!\nEdgeworth:\n... Court is in session. ...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nI'm sorry, Your Honor. You were saying?\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! This is a court of law!\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry, Your Honor! But...!\nJudge:\nI am reluctant to do this, however... It appears that I have no choice but to suspend proceedings until tomorrow!\nPhoenix:\n(I... This time, I really can't do anything...)\nJudge:\nCourt is now adjourned for the day!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nPlease wait, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\n(E-Edgeworth!?)\nJudge:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nI humbly request another 30 minutes of Your Honor's time.\nJudge:\nFor what purpose?\nEdgeworth:\nWe can perform the necessary tests on this piece of evidence in that time!\nJudge:\nHmm... But can you really obtain your results in 30 minutes?\nEdgeworth:\nI believe we can, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nBut wouldn't it be better if we adjourned for today and then reconvened tomorrow...?\nEdgeworth:\nThirty minutes. Please, Your Honor. That's all I am asking for.\nPhoenix:\nPlease! Your Honor!\nJudge:\n... Very well.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nJudge:\nAt the prosecution's request, this court will now take a 30 minute recess. But be advised that I will not allow another recess today.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not sure if this is helping... or hurting us...)\nJudge:\nThe court will now take its final recess of the day!\nMarch 23, 2:04 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3\nEdgeworth:\nWright! Well!? What's going on with Maya's situation!?\nPhoenix:\nDe Killer... It looks like he got away again. Thirty minutes...? We can't find her in that time...\nEdgeworth:\nUnnngh...\nPhone:\n...\nPhone:\n...*beep*...\nEdgeworth:\nReport!\nGumshoe:\nAh! I-Is that Mr. Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\nWe don't have time! Just spit it out!\nGumshoe:\nR-Right! It looks like we just missed them, sir. But De Killer left a few things behind by accident in his rush to get away.\nEdgeworth:\nA few things...?\nPhoenix:\nCan we use any of them as evidence?\nGumshoe:\nHo ho ho. I thought you'd ask, pal!\nPhoenix:\n...?\nGumshoe:\nI've got the things he left with me right now and I'm on my way over!\nPhoenix:\nReally!?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's odd. Any items like that are usually sent to the crime lab first...\nGumshoe:\nWe don't have time to wait for those guys, sir! When those guys weren't looking, I swiped the stuff and ran!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat!?\nGumshoe:\nWell... I'm not a detective anymore, so I had to... I'm really sorry, sir, but I've got to put the law on hold for now!\nPhoenix:\n(Sounds bad... I hope he doesn't get in too much trouble over this...)\nGumshoe:\nWith my hunk of junk car, I'd say I'll be there in about 20 minutes, sir! Don't worry! I'll be there! Wait for me!\nEdgeworth:\nA-Alright... Just get here in one piece.\nGumshoe:\nI'm on a mission and no one can stop me now, sir! No one! I'm pulling out all the stops and running every red light!\nPhoenix:\n(Items left by the murderer, huh... Maybe there's something among them that will be decisive enough to end this!)\nEdgeworth:\nHey! What's wrong!? Detective Gumshoe! Answer me!\nGumshoe:\n... No one can stop... I'm...\nPhone:\n...*beep* *beep* *beep*...\nPhoenix:\nWh-What happened?\nEdgeworth:\nIt sounded like he had an accident. I'm guessing his cell phone broke as well.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What was he thinking?? We've got to hurry and call for help!\nEdgeworth:\nBut we have no idea where he is. His cell phone is broken, and he wasn't driving a patrol car, so no radio either. Also... If we don't get to those items before they do, the police will take possessions of them.\nPhoenix:\nNo! We can't let that happen!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, if there is a way we can find out where he is, then we stand a chance...\nPhoenix:\n(Why, oh why did Gumshoe have to get into an accident now!? Is there any way to find out exactly where he is at this moment...!?)\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth...\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is it?\nPhoenix:\nI don't have any right to judge anyone ever again...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nI know my client is guilty. But what I'm doing now... I'm pinning the guilt onto someone totally innocent, and using the evidence to do so... ... It might be my turn to say, \"Defense Attorney Phoenix Wright chooses death\"...\nEdgeworth:\nWright. It doesn't suit someone like you to cry useless tears. Whether you did your job well or not... That can only be seen after the verdict has been decided.\nPhoenix:\nThe verdict...\nBailiff:\nIs Prosecutor Edgeworth here!?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, bailiff?\nBailiff:\nThere's a phone call for you, sir. They said it was extremely urgent.\nEdgeworth:\nThey're probably finished with the handwriting analysis. I have to go take this call. In the mean time, think hard about what it is you must do.\nTo be continued.\nMarch 23, 2:35 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3\nJudge:\nCourt will now reconvene. I assume both sides are ready?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor...\nEdgeworth:\nY-Yes, Your Honor...\nJudge:\n...I can understand the defense acting like this, however, why do you also seem distraught, Mr. Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\nI... that is... It's nothing, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\n(What's wrong with Edgeworth...?)\nMia:\nIt looks like something unexpected just happened to him.\nJudge:\nNow then, Mr. Edgeworth. If you could please tell the court the results of the handwriting analysis on Ms. Inpax's suicide note...\nEdgeworth:\nY...Yes, Your Honor. Unfortunately... We have discovered that this suicide note is a forgery.\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nJudge:\nWhat do you mean, Mr. Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\nThis... This note was not written by Ms. Inpax herself! It is a fake!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order! Mr. Edgeworth! Would you care to explain what is going on!? If this was not written by Ms. Inpax, then who wrote it!?\nEdgeworth:\nWe would need more time to do a more detailed analysis, however... It appears that the handwriting matches that of the victim, Mr. Juan Corrida.\nPhoenix:\nMr. C-Corrida...?\nMia:\nWell, well... It looks like Ms. Inpax never left a suicide note after all. She never wrote anything about Engarde...\nEdgeworth:\nHowever! Your Honor. Even though this suicide note is indeed a fake, Mr. Engarde could not have known that, and so that [sic] facts remain unchanged! Acting under the assumption that it was real, he had plotted to possess it!\nJudge:\nHmm... That does sound very plausible.\nPhoenix:\n(This theory that Engarde had no idea that the suicide note was fake... Something seems a little wrong with it...)\nJudge:\nSo then, the defendant knew this suicide note was a fake. And if that's true, then the situation has suddenly changed in a very dramatic way.\nPhoenix:\nExactly, Your Honor! The prosecution's theory as to what Mr. Engarde's motive for murder was... It has suddenly disappeared into thin air!\nEdgeworth:\nBut Your Honor! It's not as if Mr. Engarde monitored Mr. Corrida 24 hours a day! Perhaps the victim wrote the note in a place Mr. Engarde didn't know of!\nPhoenix:\nWell, right back at you, Mr. Edgeworth! Why don't you show us some proof that the victim made the forgery at an unknown place!?\nEdgeworth:\nGnnngh!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order! ...Mr. Edgeworth. It looks like this time, it is you who has dug his own grave.\nEdgeworth:\nUnnnngh... As I figured...\nJudge:\nHuh? ...As you figured...?\nEdgeworth:\nAs I figured... It came down to this after all...\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth, you are not making any sense...\nEdgeworth:\nWhen I heard the results of the handwriting analysis, I thought this might happen. The question is... \"What next?\"\nPhoenix:\nWhat next...??\nEdgeworth:\nIf the prosecution can't prove Mr. Engarde's motive through the evidence, then we must prove it from another angle.\nJudge:\nWell, I agree with you there...\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor. The prosecution... would like to call a witness to the stand at this time...\nJudge:\nOh. Well, that's fine.\nEdgeworth:\nHowever... this witness... This witness is a little... unusual...\nPhoenix:\n(Edgeworth stuttering...? This is not like him at all.)\nJudge:\nUnusual? Well, what sort of witness is this person, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nThis witness is one who is perfectly fit to answer once and for all the question of, \"Who was it that hired Shelly de Killer to commit murder?\"\nPhoenix:\nThat's impossible!! Who in the...!? No such person exists who can answer that question with such certainty!\nJudge:\nY-Yes! Mr. Edgeworth! Who is this witness!?\nEdgeworth:\nIt is... It's... um...\nJudge:\nYes!? Go on! Who is it!?\nEdgeworth:\nThe man himself... Mr. Shelly de Killer.\nJudge:\nOh, Mr. de Killer. ... W-W-Waaaaait!! Shelly de Killer!? Um, you mean... The killer? Err... I mean the assassin?\nEdgeworth:\nYes... Your Honor.\nJudge:\nHe's coming here? To the witness stand...?\nEdgeworth:\nWell, yes, in a manner of speaking... I recognize that this is a very unusual circumstance, so I ask for your permission.\nJudge:\nHmm... Well, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes?\nJudge:\nIs this alright with you?\nPhoenix:\n(Do I have a choice here...? I can't really do much else to drag this trial out...) The defense has no objections, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nI wonder if it really is alright to do this...?\nEdgeworth:\nVery well then. The prosecution calls our witness to the stand!\nPhoenix:\n(Edgeworth... Is there no other way left to us...?)\nEdgeworth:\nNow then, witness. ...Um, your name... and your, uh... occupation, please.\nde Killer:\nVery good, sir. My name is Shelly de Killer, and I am a professional assassin.\nJudge:\nI... I say!! Wh-What is going on here!?\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor?\nJudge:\nHow can you remain so calm? And what is the meaning of this two-way radio...?\nEdgeworth:\nActually, Your Honor, it was delivered to me just now... And it came with a condition. As long as we do not trace its source, Mr. de Killer will testify to this court.\nPhoenix:\n(So this must be what that urgent phone call he got earlier was about...)\nJudge:\nOh no, this will not do. I cannot allow this in my court. First of all, we can't even be sure this is really Mr. de Killer himself!\nEdgeworth:\nWitness. Please present some sort of proof that you are in fact Shelly de Killer.\nde Killer:\nI understand. Please wait a second.\nJudge:\n...?\n???:\n...\nMaya:\n... I'm... sooo... hungry...\nPhoenix:\nM-M-Maya!\nMia:\nMaya!\nJudge:\nA... A voice! Mr. Wright! Can you confirm anything from this!?\nPhoenix:\nThe defense has no objections to this person! We are satisfied that this man is indeed Shelly de Killer!\nJudge:\nIt looks like we have run into yet another unexpected turn of events... Well, it doesn't seem like we have too many choices under these circumstances, so...\nEdgeworth:\n...Now then, witness. There is one thing I would like to confirm before we speak of anything else.\nde Killer:\nAnd what would that be?\nEdgeworth:\nAt the request of a client, you killed Mr. Juan Corrida. Is this correct?\nde Killer:\n... It is as you say. I did indeed kill Mr. Corrida.\nJudge:\n*gulp*\nEdgeworth:\nNow that we have answered that, let's move on to the name of your client!\nde Killer:\n...Very well.\nJudge:\nThis is all just a bad dream... Yes, that's it, a bad dream...\nPhoenix:\n(Shelly de Killer... What is he going to say...?)\nWitness Testimony\n-- About My Client --\nde Killer:\nThere is something I must first state.\nTo an assassin, nothing is more important than the trust between a client and himself.\nAnd that is the reason I am here today on this witness stand.\nIt is my wish that you grasp this concept before I give the name of my client.\nJudge:\nHmm, Mr. de Killer seems to be a very clever man. I'd almost say he seems to be mocking us.\nEdgeworth:\nWhile he may appear to be our enemy, Your Honor, Mr. de Killer is only stating the truth. He is no hypocrite. He has always stood by this one belief.\nJudge:\nYou mean about this \"trust between his clients and himself\" thing? Hmm, it seems to be a level of trust beyond what people like me can comprehend. ...Well, Mr. Wright? Are you ready to cross-examine the witness?\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.\nMia:\nThere's no way to know what's coming next, so stay cool and collected, Phoenix.\nCross Examination\n-- About My Client --\nde Killer:\nThere is something I must first state.\nde Killer:\nTo an assassin, nothing is more important than the trust between a client and himself.\nde Killer:\nAnd that is the reason I am here today on this witness stand.\nde Killer:\nIt is my wish that you grasp this concept before I give the name of my client.\nde Killer:\nNow then, I do believe it's about time I revealed the name of my client, don't you agree?\nPhoenix:\n(I don't really care about all this extra fluff. Just tell us the name already!)\nMia:\nPatience. Try to calm down a little. It's important to try and understand his mindset. He seems very steadfast and closed so you're going to have to work to get him to talk.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not his therapist, you know...)\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\nWhat is it?\nPhoenix:\n(Umm... Now I can't bring myself to ask the client's name...)\nEdgeworth:\nIf you can't ask it, Mr. Wright, then I will. Witness! What is the name of your client who requested the murder of Mr. Juan Corrida!?\nde Killer:\nThat person's name is...\nPhoenix:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nJudge:\n...\nde Killer:\n...Adrian Andrews...\nPhoenix:\nWhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\nEdgeworth:\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\nJudge:\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat\n!?!?\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nW-Witness!! That's not who you told me it was earlier!\nPhoenix:\n...!\nde Killer:\nPray tell, what are you talking about, Mr. Prosecutor? I should think I know my own client, and it is Adrian Andrews.\nEdgeworth:\nWhaaaaaaaat!?!? Th-This can't be! On the phone earlier...\nPhoenix:\nWh-What's going on here...?\nMia:\nMy guess is that Mr. de Killer just stabbed Mr. Edgeworth in the back.\nPhoenix:\nStabbed Edgeworth in the back...?\nMia:\nI'm sure in order to get an audience with this court, Mr. de Killer told him a different name... \"Matt Engarde\", perhaps...?\nPhoenix:\n(I knew it...)\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nThis... This is outrageous! I was deceived! This witness is telling a very serious lie!\nJudge:\nB-But you were the one who summoned this witness!\nEdgeworth:\nGrk! Grr... Y-You... Shelly de Killer...!\nde Killer:\nMy testimony is the truth. The defendant at the moment is Matt Engarde, am I correct? All I wish to do is help procure his acquittal.\nJudge:\nH... Hmm...\nMia:\nWow... All of a sudden, it feels like we can actually win this.\nPhoenix:\nYeah...\nJudge:\nThe prosecution has failed to provide a motive and has instead, provided this suicide note, which is a forgery created by the victim. Furthermore, there is a possibility the defendant himself knew it was a fake. But most definitive of all, we have heard from the assassin himself; the name of his client. Mr. de Killer's client who requested the murder was not the defendant at all!\nEdgeworth:\n...No...\nJudge:\nWith all this evidence, it is obvious to me that this means that Mr. Matt Engarde... Is innocent!\nde Killer:\nI seem to have caused you all a bit of confusion. Please, continue your discussion, and call me when you have reached a verdict.\n...*beep*...\nJudge:\nBailiff! Please bring Ms. Adrian Andrews in immediately!\nMia:\nWhat now? With the way this is going, Engarde will be found innocent. This may be our last chance... to save Maya...\nPhoenix:\nYeah... But... But Edgeworth is right. De Killer is lying! And Engarde... my client... I know he's guilty! (Can I live with myself if I win this!?)\nJudge:\nWho would've believed that the prosecution's own witness would absolve the defendant!?\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor! The prosecution requests permission to further question the witness! Shelly de Killer is certainly lying under oath!\nJudge:\nHmm...\nAndrews:\nIt wasn't me! Listen! Everyone! Please! That testimony just now... It was all one big lie!\nPhoenix:\nMs. Andrews...\nAndrews:\nThe suicide note may have been a fake. But! That man... Matt... He's the reason Celeste died! And Juan's death... It was all because he got pulled into Matt's twisted world! That testimony just now... You have to believe me... It was a horrible, horrible lie...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nJudge:\nBut... Mr. de Killer himself has testified... He has named you as his client.\nAndrews:\nNo! That's not true!\nJudge:\nAlso, there is quite a bit of evidence that points to you. The knife and button, donning the Nickel Samurai costume... (Changed from [The knife and button, donning the Nickel Samurai's costume...] in the original release)\nAndrews:\nBut that's... That's...\nJudge:\nYou even have a motive. We know that Ms. Celeste Inpax was a large part of your life. You wanted to follow her... And you wanted revenge against the two who hurt her. I would say you have plenty of reasons to want them both dead.\nAndrews:\nI... No... Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\n...!\nAndrews:\nYou... You know the truth! Tell them! Tell them the real story... Who the real killer is... Tell them! Please... Help me...\nPhoenix:\n(Yes, I know the truth...)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nI believe we have reached the end of this trial. Therefore, I ask the defense for any final words or opinions.\nPhoenix:\n... (I have to decide... Do I take the not guilty verdict and save Maya... Or do I throw this chance away and wait for Gumshoe's new evidence...? What am I supposed to do!?)\nMia:\nPhoenix...\nPhoenix:\nI can't do it, Mia... I can't accept a not guilty.\nMia:\nYou are a lawyer.\nPhoenix:\nI know. But... But Matt Engarde is a killer -- a murderer! I can't... I can't let him get away with this. I can't let someone else take the fall. If I let Ms. Andrews be convicted, then I am no better than Engarde. And even though I don't want to admit it, I have to face the fact that it is because of Edgeworth that I now know the real truth. He could've gotten Engarde convicted so many times over, but he never took a single one of those chances. If I take this verdict right now... I'd be betraying his trust. (...His trust...? I never thought about it until now... I... I trust him...?)\nMia:\n... Yes, you do.\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. Your opinion, please.\nPhoenix:\nThe defense requests that we be allowed to further question Mr. de Killer.\nJudge:\nA-Am I hearing you correctly, Mr. Wright!?\nEdgeworth:\nWright...\nJudge:\nBut... But... That witness has cleared your client through his testimony! Your job here is done!\nPhoenix:\nI'm not done yet. To see through witnesses' lies and find the truth... (Changed from [I'm not done yet. To see through this witness' lies and find the truth...] in the original release) THAT is my job, Your Honor!\nJudge:\n...!\nPhoenix:\n(There's still more evidence to look at... And I'm sure that once those pieces arrive here in this very courtroom... a miracle will occur!)\nJudge:\nVery well. The trial will continue. Mr. Edgeworth. Please re-establish connection with Mr. de Killer.\nEdgeworth:\nRight away, Your Honor!\nde Killer:\n...Has a verdict been reached?\nEdgeworth:\nBefore that, we would like to talk with you a little more.\nde Killer:\nAbout? All you needed from me was the name of my client. What else could you need me for?\nEdgeworth:\nWell... Actually, we would like to hear everything you know about this case. This is how things are... usually done.\nPhoenix:\n(What is he talking about? \"Usually done\"...??)\nJudge:\nBut... What shall we have him testify about now?\nEdgeworth:\nMr. de Killer. If you don't mind, please testify about your client in more detail.\nde Killer:\nYou legal people and your procedures. Is it any wonder no one likes to go to court?\nWitness Testimony\n-- About My Client, Pt. 2 --\nde Killer:\nAs I have already stated quite a few times, Adrian Andrews is my client. However.\nOne thing I simply cannot overlook is tampering with the scene of the crime.\nMy client did it to frame another for the crime.\nWhile pretending to be the first person to discover the body and enter the scene,\nAdrian Andrews already knew from the very beginning that Juan Corrida was dead!\nBut even more appalling is the creation and planting of the \"knife\" and \"button\".\nThat act is what I was referring to when I said my client had \"broken the rules\".\nJudge:\nHmm... This is a most unexpected turn of events... For the... um, fifth time now...? However, this time, everything has finally been revealed.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nJust a second, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nYes, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nWe still have the cross-examination to do...\nJudge:\nBut you don't need to question testimony like this... Do you, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\n... Your Honor, the defense will question the witness. (As if I have a choice here!)\nJudge:\nHuh!? Why!? What this witness has said is nothing but beneficial to the defense's case! If you scrutinize the testimony, then...\nPhoenix:\n(...Then I'll expose the lies in that oh-so-\"beneficial\" testimony, I suppose.)\nJudge:\nI don't understand what's going on anymore...\nPhoenix:\n(That makes two of us...)\nCross Examination\n-- About My Client, Pt. 2 --\nde Killer:\nAs I have already stated quite a few times, Adrian Andrews is my client. However.\nde Killer:\nOne thing I simply cannot overlook is tampering with the scene of the crime.\nde Killer:\nMy client did it to frame another for the crime.\nde Killer:\nWhile pretending to be the first person to discover the body and enter the scene,\nde Killer:\nAdrian Andrews already knew from the very beginning that Juan Corrida was dead!\nde Killer:\nBut even more appalling is the creation and planting of the \"knife\" and \"button\".\nde Killer:\nThat act is what I was referring to when I said my client had \"broken the rules\".\nMia:\nWhat are you going to do now, Phoenix?\nPhoenix:\nAll I can do now is expose the lies.\nMia:\nThat's true... However, you realize that will be very bad for our client, right?\nPhoenix:\n(Nnngh... I'm so confused... But the one thing I know for sure is I can't let this trial end yet!)\nPhoenix:\nThank you so much for taking the time to testify, Mr. de Killer.\nde Killer:\nWhat is the meaning of that attitude?\nPhoenix:\nWhen Adrian Andrews entered the victim's room, your \"client\" had no idea that Juan Corrida had been murdered!\nJudge:\nBut how... How do you know that!?\nPhoenix:\nFrom this wine glass, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nThe glass...\nPhoenix:\nMr. de Killer's supposed client thought Mr. Corrida had only fainted. Which is why this glass of tomato juice was poured for the victim!\nJudge:\nHmm... But isn't that just a part of Adrian Andrews' calculated plan?\nPhoenix:\nThat is not possible, Your Honor. This glass bears the fingerprints of that person. Had this been planned, they would never have left their fingerprints behind!\nJudge:\nI see your point... Mr. Edgeworth!? What is your opinion?\nEdgeworth:\nStrangely enough... I had the same exact thought just now. Witness! How do you explain this strange phenomenon!?\nde Killer:\nI-Isn't it a waste of time to ask about such a minor detail? It's not a very important point anyway, correct...?\nEdgeworth:\nI'm afraid you are mistaken. If Adrian Andrews really is your client, as you claim... Then your client should have had knowledge of Mr. Corrida's death. If not... Then that can only mean that Adrian Andrews was never your client at all!\nde Killer:\n... How strange...\nJudge:\nYes?\nde Killer:\nWhy is it that the attorney has yet to raise an objection at this absurd situation...?\nPhoenix:\n...!\nMia:\nPhoenix. If De Killer figures out what we're up to, we're in real trouble!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I know...\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nMr. Edgeworth! I'm surprised! You know you can't say things like that without any evidence.\nEdgeworth:\nAh... Sorry.\nJudge:\n... Th-That sounded like an awfully weak \"Objection!\" to me...\nEdgeworth:\nAnyway! I am positive there was a contradiction in that testimony. The prosecution requests further testimony concerning when the request was taken!\nde Killer:\n... Very well.\nPhoenix:\n(Right now, I have to buy us more time... While we wait for the items De Killer left behind to get here. I just know that the very outcome of this trial lies with those items!)\nWitness Testimony\n-- Request Taking --\nde Killer:\nThis request came to me... oh, about a week ago.\nIt was a request for my services on the night of the awards ceremony.\nWe met at a certain bar to discuss and finalize a few matters.\nThat is what occurred. I trust my memory, and I believe I have made no mistakes.\nJudge:\nHmm... So you physically met your client, huh?\nde Killer:\nThat is correct. Meeting one's client is the first step to building trust, in my opinion.\nJudge:\nI see... Well, Mr. Wright, your cross-examination, please.\nCross Examination\n-- Request Taking --\nde Killer:\nThis request came to me... oh, about a week ago.\nde Killer:\nIt was a request for my services on the night of the awards ceremony.\nde Killer:\nWe met at a certain bar to discuss and finalize a few matters.\nde Killer:\nFrom the moment I saw him, I thought, \"I can trust this person as a client.\"\nde Killer:\nThat is what occurred. I trust my memory, and I believe I have made no mistakes.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, there doesn't seem to be anything strange this time around...)\nMia:\nYou have to draw more information from him, but you can't draw his suspicion. If you can do that, you should be able to find a flaw in his testimony somewhere.\nPhoenix:\n(Talk about a delicate balance...)\nPhoenix:\nI would like to go over this one more time. You met Adrian Andrews at a bar and took the request at that time?\nde Killer:\nYes, that is correct.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when you thought \"he\" was trustworthy...\nde Killer:\nHow many times must I repeat myself? Yes, that is correct.\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry, but that is an impossible tale.\nde Killer:\nWh-What!?\nPhoenix:\nShelly de Killer. You have never met the real Adrian Andrews!\nde Killer:\n...! Wh-Why would you say that...?\nPhoenix:\nBecause you made one very big slip-up... ...about her.\nde Killer:\nSo what is the issue... ...! Wh-What did you say just now...? About \"her\"...?\nPhoenix:\nIf you had ever met Adrian Andrews in person... One look would have told you that she is a woman!\nde Killer:\nOhoooooo!\nJudge:\nO-Order! Order in the court! Mr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!?\nPhoenix:\nThis witness testified to the following: That he always meets face to face with his clients when taking their request.\nJudge:\nBut he has never met Adrian Andrews in person...\nEdgeworth:\nYes, Your Honor! That is exactly the point! That means Mr. de Killer's client could not have been Ms. Adrian Andrews!\nde Killer:\nUgnnn...\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth... I understand your logic on this one... However... Why would the assassin make such a basic mistake?\nEdgeworth:\nI believe it has to do with her name, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nHer name?\nEdgeworth:\nYes. Adrian Andrews is, without a doubt, a very androgynous name.\nJudge:\nHmm... Yes, I see...\nEdgeworth:\nUnluckily for Mr. de Killer, the entire time he was on the stand, no one had stated Adrian Andrews' gender. And so, he simply picked the wrong gender to go with.\nJudge:\nWh-What... What is going on...? Shelly de Killer! This court demands an explanation!\nde Killer:\nUmm... I-I think somehow... I must have mixed up this client with another.\nEdgeworth:\nSo does that mean you remember something different now?\nde Killer:\nYes, of course. Please, if you would allow me to testify once more...\nPhoenix:\n(Argh! I know he's just going to spit out more lies.)\nJudge:\nVery well. But this time, please give us the truth, and nothing but the truth!\nWitness Testimony\n-- Request Taking, Pt. 2 --\nde Killer:\nYes, now I remember. I took that request by mail.\nThere have been times when I took a job without having met my client.\nThe request was for the murder of Juan Corrida and 2 or 3 other small things.\nWhen I saw the name at the end of the letter, I thought my client to be a man.\nJudge:\nHmm... So you took this job through a letter...\nPhoenix:\n(He didn't mention anything about a letter in his earlier testimony... Which means he is definitely lying!)\nMia:\nBe careful, Phoenix. If you break the assassin's testimony completely, it's over for us.\nPhoenix:\nI know... I can't make him suspicious. But... I think we're OK -- like we can do this. (As long as he's standing there across from me... No matter how strong of a punch I throw, he'll counter it...)\nJudge:\nNow then, let's begin the cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- Request Taking, Pt. 2 --\nde Killer:\nYes, now I remember. I took that request by mail.\nde Killer:\nThere have been times when I took a job without having met my client.\nde Killer:\nThe request was for the murder of Juan Corrida and 2 or 3 other small things.\nde Killer:\nOne of these was to find the bear figurine and to give it to Adrian Andrews.\nde Killer:\nWhen I saw the name at the end of the letter, I thought my client to be a man.\nMia:\nWe've pretty much reached the end of our rope here...\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Seems like we're still OK to me.\nMia:\nAnd that's exactly what is so bad. At the rate we're going, we will end up completely destroying De Killer's lie. If we do that... You already know how serious of a situation that will put us in.\nPhoenix:\nO-Oh yeah... (All I can do now is pray that those items reach us in time...)\nPhoenix:\nShelly de Killer. If you had really given the bear to Ms. Andrews... then this item should not have been inside it.\nde Killer:\n\"This item\"...?\nEdgeworth:\nI see where you're going...\nPhoenix:\nYup, that's where I'm going...\nJudge:\nWhere is everyone going!? Do I need to pack a suitcase?\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor. Please think back to Ms. Andrews' testimony.\nAndrews:\nAnd I was going to burn it... for her sake.\nPhoenix:\nIf even for a single minute, this bear had actually been in Ms. Andrews' hands... I'm sure she would have taken the suicide note out and burned it!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order! So that's where you two were going!\nEdgeworth:\nSo by the very fact that this suicide note was still inside the bear... It tells us that your \"client\" didn't know how to disassemble the puzzle! (Changed from [Tells us that your \"client\" didn't know how to disassemble the puzzle!] in the original release)\nJudge:\nWh-Which means...?\nEdgeworth:\nIt means, Your Honor, that it is impossible for Adrian Andrews to be the \"client\"!\nde Killer:\nOhoooooo!\nJudge:\nO...Order! Order! ORDER!!\nde Killer:\n... Ungh... Mr...Phoenix Wright...\nPhoenix:\n...!\nde Killer:\nI... I'm sure I mentioned this before. How I hate traitors above all else!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nde Killer:\nI think your cross-examination has clearly demonstrated something to me. You... You must wish to break your end of our agreement!\nPhoenix:\nNo! That's not...\nde Killer:\nThat's enough! If that is your intention, then there is only one thing for me to do!\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait! Please!\nde Killer:\nGentlemen, ladies, please excuse me. I have a matter that I must attend to.\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nN...No... Please... Not that... Please wait...\nde Killer:\nMr. Attorney! Bring this trial to a speedy end, and I may stay my hand! Otherwise...\nPhoenix:\nNnnngh... Gnwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!\nJudge:\nWhat in the...? Mr. Wright...? Are you...?\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth...?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nI didn't understand this witness' outburst just now. Do you think there is a need to hear more testimony, or is this enough...?\nEdgeworth:\nWell... We should...\nPhoenix:\n(Edgeworth! We can't do this! If we keep this up... Maya... She'll...!)\nEdgeworth:\nU...Ungh! The prosecution... I...\nJudge:\nWh-What has come over everyone? Even you are...\nEdgeworth:\nThe prosecution... rests.\nJudge:\nWhat is going on around here...?\nEdgeworth:\nThe prosecution has no further questions, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nWh... Whaaaaaaat!?\nJudge:\nWell, I never thought I'd see the day. This is a most unusual situation... If the prosecution rests with no further questions... Then... the prosecution has failed to uphold its stance.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nJudge:\nIf that is the case, then even though I am reluctant, I must believe that Mr. de Killer's testimony is accurate. That would mean that Shelly de Killer's client is... Adrian Andrews!\nPhoenix:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nNnngh...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nIf I end the trial here, right now, then your client, Matt Engarde, would be declared innocent. And in his place, Adrian Andrews would be charged with murder.\nPhoenix:\n(M-Ms. Andrews... would be charged with murder!)\nEdgeworth:\n...\nJudge:\nThe prosecution has no further questions, so we will now hear the defense's final remarks. Bailiff! Please bring the defendant, Matt Engarde, to the stand!\nMia:\nThe items from De Killer's hideout didn't make it in time... We tried as hard as we could, but it looks like our time has run out...\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe it...)\nMia:\nThe outcome now lies in your hands.\nEngarde:\nDude, did the old guy finally decide?\nJudge:\nTo be honest, I can't think of you as a truly innocent and good person. You have done enough evil to drive a woman to suicide.\nEngarde:\n...\nJudge:\nBut... At least on the charge of murder, it would appear you are innocent.\nEngarde:\n... Hah...! So, I guess even the old fuddy-duddy figured me out!\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Engarde...?\nEngarde:\nWhat an atrocious lawyer I have -- giving his own client up like this! (Changed from [You were atrocious as a lawyer, weren't you? Giving your client away like this!] in the original release) And that \"refreshing like a spring breeze\" crap; it's just as atrocious, don't you agree?\nEdgeworth:\n...\nEngarde:\nAnyway, get on with it and pronounce me innocent already. Right, Mister Lawyer!?\nPhoenix:\n... (Should I side with justice? Or should I save Maya's life?)\nMaya:\nYou'd better get Engarde a guilty sentence, OK!?\nPhoenix:\n(But... But if I did that... Maya will die! But if I say he's innocent... Then Ms. Andrews will be charged as the murderer! Do I say he's \"guilty\"... or \"not guilty\"...? Either choice I make, someone's life is going to end! It all hinges on what I choose! ([choose] in quotation marks in the original release))\nJudge:\nNow then, Mr. Wright. Let's hear the defense's final statements on this matter.\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\nIf the person who hired the assassin was Adrian Andrews... Then your client, Mr. Matt Engarde is innocent.\nEngarde:\nHmph... There's no need to ask, old man. After all, my lawyer is going to say what I want... aren't you?\nEdgeworth:\nWright...\nPhoenix:\n(I can't! I can't do this! But I have to decide something! I can't count on the evidence to help me anymore. I have to listen to my heart!) My client... Matt Engarde is...\nJudge:\nWe are waiting for your answer, Mr. Wright! Matt Engarde, your client deserves an answer!\nPhoenix:\n... (Maya... I'm sorry...) Matt Engarde is...\nvon Karma:\nPhoenix:\nF-Franziska von Karma!!\nJudge:\nWh-What are you doing here... OWW!\nvon Karma:\nYou see now, don't you... Mr. Phoenix Wright? This is exactly why you should NEVER take your eyes off of that scruffy fool!\nEdgeworth:\nDid you bring them? The final pieces... Do you have them?\nvon Karma:\nYou should know better than to ask that, Mr. Miles Edgeworth. A Von Karma is perfect in every way! The evidence is here in perfect condition! Don't worry about Scruffy. He's fine, and his injuries are minor. All of the items are inside this.\nJudge:\nWhat a filthy, old coat this is...\nPhoenix:\n(That's Gumshoe's... I can spot his tattered rags anywhere...)\nvon Karma:\nI apologize for its ugliness, but there was nothing else to wrap the items in.\nPhoenix:\n(I've fought long and hard this whole trial... All for what is inside that raggedy coat... I'm sure that inside that coat, lies a crucial piece of evidence!) Your Honor! Inside that filthy coat... Are the defense's final pieces of evidence!\nJudge:\nYour final... evidence!?\nJudge:\n... This trial is already over. All that remains is for me to hand down my verdict. I do not believe that any evidence presented now, would change the outcome of this trial.\nPhoenix:\n(Wh-What!?)\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor. It is our duty to examine every piece of evidence, down to the last. I request that Ms. von Karma be allowed to present these pieces of evidence!\nJudge:\nHmm... I suppose you are right, Mr. Edgeworth. I grant permission to do so. However, this one obvious rule applies here; If these items do not bring up any new points, then they will not be accepted by this court.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nJudge:\nNow, Ms. von Karma. If you please.\nvon Karma:\nThese pieces of evidence are items left by De Killer during his escape from the police.\nJudge:\nHmm... He must have been in quite a rush.\nvon Karma:\nYes, Your Honor. De Killer left three pieces of evidence.\nPhoenix:\n(Somewhere among the evidence we're about to see... There will be something that will turn this whole situation around... like a miracle. I'm sure of it!)\nMia:\nThat is all we can hope for.\nvon Karma:\nThe first item is a pistol.\nPhoenix:\n(Does De Killer's pistol have anything to do with this case...?)\nPistol added to the Court Record.\nvon Karma:\nThe second piece of evidence is this video tape.\nPhoenix:\n(I bet De Killer took that from Engarde Mansion...)\nVideo Tape added to the Court Record.\nvon Karma:\nThe last piece of evidence is this bellboy's uniform.\nPhoenix:\n(Is that a uniform from the Gatewater Hotel...?)\nBellboy's Uniform added to the Court Record.\nvon Karma:\nThat is all I have to present, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nHmm... It's just as I thought.\nPhoenix:\nAnd... what is that, Your Honor..?\nJudge:\nI'm sure, were we under normal circumstances, these items from Shelly de Killer's hideout would be very important clues. However... Our question is not \"Who did the killing?\"\nEdgeworth:\nIt is, \"Who is the client?\"...\nJudge:\nYes, that is correct. And these three items do not tell us anything about that! Thank you for your hard work, Ms. von Karma. You may step down now.\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWait, Your Honor! Please allow me to examine this new evidence!\nJudge:\nOverruled. This court already has all the evidence it needs to hand down a verdict!\nEngarde:\nWonderful... Absolutely splendid. This judge is such a brilliant man, isn't he?\nPhoenix:\n(Is this the end...?)\nMia:\nPhoenix.\nPhoenix:\nI knew it... There's no such thing as a \"miracle\" in this world, is there?\nMia:\nI think you're wrong. I think they do exist. But you have to make that \"miracle\" happen. You've come this far! You can't give up now!\nPhoenix:\nBut... But... No matter how you think about it... It's... It's...\nMia:\nTry... For my sake. Just think about it for a second. There are two ways out of this situation for us.\nPhoenix:\n(T-Two!?)\nMia:\nThe first... Make Engarde wish from the bottom of his soul for a guilty verdict.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMia:\nDe Killer will always place his client's wishes first. If Engarde himself wished to be convicted, then he will let his hostage go.\nPhoenix:\nTh-That may be true, but... That's asking me to do the impossible!\nMia:\nThe second way... Force De Killer to end his contract with Engarde. If De Killer were to no longer think of Engarde as his \"client\"... Then he would let Maya go.\nPhoenix:\nMia! That's even more impossible! He is a man who values his duty towards his clients above all else!\nMia:\n... I know both of these seem like impossible feats at first. But if you could make either one happen, it would truly be a \"miracle\".\nPhoenix:\nThe bigger problem is, the judge has already said he doesn't need any more evidence! The pieces he was just shown -- he's not accepting them!\nMia:\nPhoenix. Think things through from the other side. Isn't that what has always worked for us?\nPhoenix:\n...! (The \"other side\"...? Wait, does she mean...) You mean... to turn things around?\nMia:\nPhoenix. The judge says he doesn't need the evidence. If that's the case, then who does need it?\nPhoenix:\n(\"The person who needs the evidence\"...)\nMia:\nThe defense, prosecution, and the judge... We have seen all the pieces of evidence. And that is how we have come to know the \"truth\". But there is one person who has yet to seen them all. (Changed from [But there are people who have not seen them all.] in the original release) And that person does not know the \"truth\". (Changed from [And those people do not know the 'truth'.] in the original release) That truth... It may be what will bring about the miracle in the end.\nJudge:\nThere are no objections this time, correct? Now then, I will pronounce my verdict!\nEngarde:\nWhy don't we all respectfully sit back and listen, kids.\nPhoenix:\nJudge:\nI have already told you, Mr. Wright. This court does not need any more evidence.\nPhoenix:\nI am not saying it is us that needs the evidence, Your Honor!\nEdgeworth:\n...!\nJudge:\nThen... you want to show the evidence to... that person...?\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.\nJudge:\n...\nPhoenix:\nPlease, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. For you to ask with such passion... I will grant you one chance.\nPhoenix:\n(O...One chance...)\nJudge:\nPlease show your evidence to who you think is the right person.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nThat's impossible! To turn this situation around in one try...\nJudge:\nOne try. That is all I will permit.\nPhoenix:\n(I have to try to remember... Everything that has happened up to this point... Think, Phoenix! Think! There must be a way to save Maya while taking Engarde down at the same time!)\nJudge:\nNow then, Mr. Wright. Let's not waste any more time.\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\nWho would you like to show evidence to?\nJudge:\nI see. And now... Tell this court what one piece of evidence you would like to show this person!\nJudge:\n... Well, what do you think, Mr. Edgeworth...?\nEdgeworth:\nUh... Um... I think there is some merit... in showing this evidence to that witness.\nJudge:\n... Bailiff! Please bring in the transceiver from earlier!\nPhoenix:\n(Alright! It looks like I managed to convince him...) (Changed from [Alright! It looks like they got a hold of him...] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nMaya... She's OK, right!?\nde Killer:\nDidn't I tell you to concern yourself with bringing about a speedy end to this trial? Now, if I understand correctly, you wish to show me one piece of evidence?\nPhoenix:\nYes. One is all I need. I have here a video tape. It was found at your hideout.\nde Killer:\n...\nPhoenix:\nI heard you injured three officers in your attempt to get this back.\nde Killer:\nThat was most regrettable. However, it was an order from my client. I was told to protect that video tape.\nPhoenix:\n(I thought so...)\nde Killer:\nI'm afraid I seem to have failed in that regard.\nPhoenix:\nDo you know the contents of this tape?\nde Killer:\nI was sternly told by my client to not watch it. So I have absolutely no idea.\nPhoenix:\nActually, you are on this tape.\nde Killer:\nMe?\nPhoenix:\nThere was a video camera hidden at the crime scene. Your actions were being recorded.\nde Killer:\nWh-What!?\nJudge:\nIs that true!? Mr. Wright!?\nde Killer:\nWho... Who was it that planted a camera...!?\nPhoenix:\nWell, the only person who could have placed a camera at the scene of the crime... would be your \"client\" naturally.\nde Killer:\n...!\nJudge:\nTh-That was... Adrian Andrews...\nEdgeworth:\nBe quiet and listen... Your Honor.\nJudge:\nYes, sir.\nPhoenix:\nYour \"client\" specified a place and time for you, isn't that right?\nde Killer:\nY-Yes...\nPhoenix:\nThat was so they could film you.\nde Killer:\n... I had no idea. ... Mr. Wright. Why would my client do such a thing?\nPhoenix:\n...\nde Killer:\nI would like to know why...\nPhoenix:\n(Why did Matt Engarde film the crime scene...? The reason \"why\" he did that is my ticket out of this whole mess!) There is only one reason why your \"client\" would secretly film the crime scene. They...\nPhoenix:\nYour \"client\" once told me something very interesting. We were talking about you, and this is what they said.\nEngarde:\nBut I'm no weakling. I don't believe anyone... least of all assassins.\nEngarde:\nOh, come now, Mr. Wright. Assassins aren't above blackmail.\nEngarde:\nYes, that's where the video comes in. With that, I can keep him at bay, and even blackmail him if I want.\nPhoenix:\nYour \"client\" didn't trust you at all. They were thinking of using this video to blackmail you! What do you have to say to that, Shelly de Killer!?\nde Killer:\nGnnn...nnnngh... Ohoooooo! ... It looks like... It looks like I was being deceived from the very beginning...\nPhoenix:\nYes... By a natural... That is the kind of person they are. Your \"client\" is a person who only thinks and plots of how to use the people around them to protect themselves from any and all dangers that may arise. That is the true nature of your \"client\".\nde Killer:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nI have one question for the witness.\nde Killer:\nYes?\nEdgeworth:\nYou told us one thing numerous times during your testimony. You said that you detest traitors most of all.\nde Killer:\nYes, that's right.\nEdgeworth:\nBut what if that traitor was your own client...? What would you do then!?\nde Killer:\n... That's obvious. I would break our contract in that case. And then... That client would become my next target. For the honor of the De Killer name, even if it takes an eternity... I would follow that person to the ends of the earth to exact my punishment.\nEdgeworth:\nI see. That's all I wanted to know.\nPhoenix:\n(So the traitor becomes De Killer's next target... Ah! I get it... This is how we'll turn this case around!)\nde Killer:\nMr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nYes...?\nde Killer:\nMy contract with my client is over as of now. I seem to have a new job on my hands. I will now return to you, your precious item.\nMaya:\n...What the!? I'm not an item!\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\n(Maya... I thought I'd never see you again... Oh thank goodness!)\nJudge:\nUm... This trial appears to have come to its conclusion... However... I... Actually, I am sort of... I don't quite know what just happened there with the client and the witness and... Gwaaah! M-Ms. von Karma! Where did that...!?\nEdgeworth:\nShe always has you in her sights. Now! I do believe it's time to finally hand down a verdict!\nPhoenix:\nMr. Engarde. It looks like somehow, you got what you wanted. You will finally receive the acquittal you wanted so badly. You should be happy.\nEdgeworth:\nBut before that, I would like to make one final statement. Sometime in the near future, one very betrayed assassin may appear before you.\nEngarde:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nNeedless to say, that man is very good at what he does. I'm sure you would understand what I mean, if you watch this video.\nEngarde:\n...H-- Help me...\nEdgeworth:\nNow then, Your Honor! The verdict, if you please.\nJudge:\nI-Is this alright with you, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\n...!\nMia:\nWe have finally reached the end of a very long battle. Whether he's convicted or acquitted, there is no escape for him now. Go on, Phoenix. Plead whichever way your heart tells you.\nPhoenix:\nRight, Chief.\nEngarde:\n... Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!Guiltyyyyyyy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Guuuuuilty!!!GGG--Guuiiillltyyyy!!!GGGUUUILLLTYYY!!GUILTY!!!GuiLTy!!guIIIltYY!!Guil--guilty!guilty!GUilTY!GUILTY!\nJudge:\nAs always, it looks like we have uncovered the real truth.\nPhoenix:\n(We? I don't remember you helping out much in this...)\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth. How is Matt Engarde?\nEdgeworth:\nI have left Ms. von Karma in charge of his incarceration. I'm sure he's getting a full-course meal of whip leather right about now.\nJudge:\nVery good. That was a close one, wasn't it, witness?\nAndrews:\nYes... I plan to pay my debt to society for my own crime, Your Honor. ... The first time I was called to the witness stand during this trial... (Changed from [This trial was the first time I had stood on the witness stand, and when I did...] in the original release) all I felt was despair. (Changed from [I really felt hopeless.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(She must be talking about the time Edgeworth really went after her... I guess she's trying to forgive him for what he did...)\nEdgeworth:\nThis witness... How should I put this... She has an illness.\nEdgeworth:\nIf you're going to say you would \"choose death\", that is of no concern to me.\nAndrews:\nBut... after that, when I was alone at the detention center... That's the first time I really saw myself for who I am. (Changed from [That's the first time I really saw myself and who I am.] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\n...\nAndrews:\nAnd today... When the two of you used your combined strength to convict Matt... I... I felt like I had finally been saved.\nPhoenix:\n(Wow, this is the first time I've ever seen her smile.)\nAndrews:\nI am really happy that you two were in charge of this case. I really don't know how to express how I feel at this moment... This is... This is the first time I've felt comfortable with myself -- with who I am. Thank you so much, everyone!\nJudge:\nIt looks like we have resolved everything at last. As for myself, there are still a few things I'm confused about... But everyone seems to be in good spirits, and that is good enough for me. That is all. This court is adjourned!\nMarch 23, 5:14 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3\nMia:\nYou were great out there, Phoenix!\nPhoenix:\nWhat I did out there was right... wasn't it?\nMia:\n... This is the first time you've not gotten your client off. You got them a \"guilty\" verdict this time. But... You have to look past all of that, to what's really important. You now realize that there is something more than just getting a \"not guilty\", right?\nPhoenix:\nYes, I understand now.\nMia:\nPhoenix, think back for a second. Think to the moments before Ms. von Karma arrived with the final pieces of evidence. Think about the incredible decision you had to make...\nJudge:\nNow then, Mr. Wright. Let's hear the defense's final statements on this matter.\nPhoenix:\n... (I can't count on the evidence to help me anymore. I have to listen to my heart! Should I side with justice? Or should I save Maya's life?) My client... Matt Engarde is...\nMia:\nIs he \"guilty\"... or is he \"not guilty\"...? Those were your choices then. And your answer... Your answer spoke to what being a \"lawyer\" means to you...\nEdgeworth:\nWright!\nPhoenix:\nE-Edgeworth...\nEdgeworth:\nI have good news. Maya is now safe in police custody!\nPearl:\nReally!?\nPhoenix:\nP-Pearls--\nPearl:\nYou're telling us the truth, right, Mr. Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\nY-Yes... She's quite safe. She is on her way here as we speak in a patrol car.\nPearl:\nAaaaaaaaah! Mystic Maya! Mystic Maya's safe!! You did it! You really did it, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\n(Oww... She punches deceptively hard for a kid...)\nPearl:\nI... I believed in you. I kept saying to myself: Mr. Nick will save her... Mr. Nick will save her... Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\nPhoenix:\nAh, um... Thanks.\nPearl:\nOh...\nPhoenix:\nWhat's wrong?\nPearl:\nMs. von Karma...\nvon Karma:\n...\nPhoenix:\nUm... About earlier... Uh... Thanks... OWW!!\nvon Karma:\nWhy are you still smiling... Mr. Phoenix Wright!? You... You lost!! Your perfect win record has now been crushed! And yet... You are still happy!?\nPhoenix:\n... I don't think you'll ever understand... Ms. von Karma.\nvon Karma:\nHow dare you!?\nEdgeworth:\nDon't worry. She may in time. After all, I was like that myself, until a year ago...\nPhoenix:\nE-Edgeworth...?\nEdgeworth:\nFor my own personal victories... and for guilty verdicts... I used every dirty trick in the book. And so my win record remained spotless. But... A man appeared and stood fast against that selfish me. I fought him in my usual manner, and tasted my first defeat. I felt like I had lost everything because of that. And then... It was my turn to sit in the defendant's chair. And I was saved... by that person I called my \"enemy\"... I couldn't forgive myself for all that had happened. So I left the Prosecutor's Office. And I left that note... \"Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth chooses death\"...\nvon Karma:\nHmph, as well you should have. A prosecutor who has shamed himself with defeat should crawl into a hole and die!\nEdgeworth:\n...But that was not what happened. After I left the Prosecutor's Office, I finally came to realize something. And it was in that moment of clarity that everything began to change.\nvon Karma:\nWh-What foolish nonsense...\nEdgeworth:\nWe prosecutors use anything we can to attack the defendant. But every time we did so...\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth:\nNo matter how desperate the situation... instead of giving up like most people, that man would hold strong with his undying faith. And then, before I knew it... I began to trust in that man as well.\nvon Karma:\nWh-What!? You trusted your enemy!?\nEdgeworth:\nIt doesn't matter how many underhanded tricks a person uses... The truth will always find a way to make itself known. The only thing we can do is to fight with the knowledge we hold and everything we have. Erasing the paradoxes one by one... It's never easy... We claw and scratch for every inch. But we will always eventually reach that one single truth. This I promise you.\nPearl:\nThe \"truth\"...\nEdgeworth:\nYes. That's the reason why prosecutors and defense lawyers exist. But I'm sure you knew that already, didn't you, Wright?\nPhoenix:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nThat's why you couldn't forgive me; this man who went into hiding. Isn't that right? This man who only had his sights set on \"victory\", who ran away into the night...\nPearl:\nAh! Is... Is Mr. Edgeworth right, Mr. Nick...!?\nPhoenix:\n(You really let me down...) When you disappeared, I felt... betrayed. The reason I decided to become a lawyer to begin with... Was because I believed in the things you said to me, all those years ago... And you... You betrayed your own words. That's why... one year ago, I made up my mind. I decided that the Miles Edgeworth I knew had died... ...At least, that's what I told myself.\nvon Karma:\nYou pathetic fool!\nPearl:\nM-Ms. von Karma...\nvon Karma:\nI don't want to hear the wretched whimpering of a disgraced loser! A Von Karma is someone who is destined to be perfect! Miles Edgeworth... You are no longer worthy! You are no longer worthy of being a Von Karma! And neither am I! It's over... It's all over!\nPhoenix:\n(Franziska threw something on the ground just now...)\nEdgeworth:\nThis is... an electromagnetic receiver.\nPhoenix:\nIsn't that the thing she used to track Detective Gumshoe...?\nEdgeworth:\nI'll return this to the precinct later. There's something else...\nPearl:\nAh! Isn't that Ms. von Karma's whip!?\nEdgeworth:\n\"I'll never set foot in another courtroom again\"... I'm sure that's what she's saying by this action...\nPhoenix:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nYou should keep this, Wright.\nPhoenix:\n... Umm... OK.\n???:\nNick!!\nPhoenix:\n......! M-M-M... MAYA!\nPearl:\nMystic Maya! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaa!\nMaya:\nOh, Nick! I knew you would come through! You got Engarde convicted, like I knew you would... And on top of that, you even rescued me!\nPhoenix:\nWell, of course I did! You know I would never desert you! But we sure pressed our luck this trial... You're really lucky to be standing here!\nMaya:\nWhatever, whatever. Look, it's over, OK? Besides, if I did croak, I would just come back and haunt you like a bad ghost through Pearly!\nPhoenix:\n... (Is it really that easy to do something like that...?)\nMaya:\n... Th-Thanks a lot... Nick.\nPhoenix:\nUm... Don't mention it.\nEdgeworth:\nMaya...\nMaya:\nOh, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nUm... I'm relieved you're alright.\nMaya:\nHey... It looks like you've made some real progress, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nUmm... Well, I suppose I'm a little different from who I was a year ago.\nMaya:\nHeh...\n*growwwwl...grrrrr...urrrr...*\nMaya:\nAlright! I think it's time we got out of this depressing place!\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Where are we going!?\nMaya:\nFood, Nick! FOOD! Grub! Chow! I'm starved! I'm so hungry even you look like a nice, juicy burger on a bun to me, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nY-You think I look like a burger...? I'm a Prime Rib at least!\nPearl:\nCome with us, Mr. Edgeworth! Please!!\nEdgeworth:\nUh, um... If you insist...\nPhoenix:\nAlright... So how about we hit up our usual burger joint...?\nMaya:\nDon't be silly, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMaya:\nThis case messed up that awesome evening, and got in the way of my gourmet food. So I've decided that we have to make it up by having another feast!\nPhoenix:\nA-Another feast...?\nMaya:\nC'mon, Nick! FOOOOOOD!\nMarch 23, 7:38 PMGatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nGumshoe:\nHey, pal! Sorry to keep you guys waiting!\nPhoenix:\nGumshoe! Are you alright!?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, but I'm really embarrassed. I didn't think I would hit a telephone pole, of all things.\nPhoenix:\nA telephone pole...? (Then, it wasn't a red light that got him...?)\nLotta:\nYa did it again, City Boy. I felt like my dear ol' heart was gonna give out on me! And I ain't jokin'!\nPowers:\nYeah! It was more exciting than the very last episode of the Steel Samurai!\nPhoenix:\nTh-Thanks...\nLotta:\nNow lookie here, mister snooty prosecutor! Don't ya reckon ya bullied Mr. Wright too hard!? If ya don't start bein' a lot nicer to him, he might just kick it... Tonight, even!\nEdgeworth:\nUmm... I'll keep that in mind.\nLotta:\nWell, come on now! Everyone gather 'round! Y'all are gonna get yer picture taken by a genuine professional photographer!\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like Lotta bought herself a new camera...)\nGumshoe:\nWell, pal... At least we can put this messy case behind us now. Come on! Tonight's all about eating, so let's go chow down, pal!\nMaya:\nAmen to that, pal! Amen!\nPowers:\nYou know, when you think about it, you were the one who saved the day, Detective!\nGumshoe:\nHuh? Me? ...You really think so?\nEdgeworth:\nHe's right. If it wasn't for the three items you took... I think this trial would have had a very different ending.\nGumshoe:\nAh, well, you know... It's... Ho ho. Ho ho ho ho. Ho ho ho ho ho. ...Huh? Wait. That's odd... When I ran off with the things from De Killer's hideout... I was sure I took 4 things in total, sir. (Changed from [I was sure I took 4 things total, sir.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nWhat?\nPearl:\nFour?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, I'm sure I put one of the items in my coat pocket...\nPhoenix:\n(There was a fourth item...?)\nLotta:\nAw, come on y'all. It's over! But whoo boy, I tell ya! You really are somethin' else! Between getting' accused of murder and getting' kidnapped... Never a dull moment with you, huh?\nMaya:\nHahaha, you think?\nPhoenix:\n(Why does she look so happy about that...?)\nPearl:\nBut being shut away for two whole days... Weren't you scared...?\nMaya:\nYeah, it was really scary. I felt so hopeless. So to keep my mind off of things, I drew a picture!\nLotta:\nSounds like ya had it rough, gal! So where's this picture of yers?\nPearl:\nYeah! I want to see it! I want to see Mystic Maya's picture!\nMaya:\n... Hmm... You know, I don't know where it went...\nPearl:\nAww... That's too bad...\nMaya:\nW-Well, it's alright! It wasn't anything important anyway.\nPhoenix:\n(Ah... It sure is nice to finally see them both smiling again.)\n...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*...\nEdgeworth:\n...Hm?\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it, Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nThis thing is picking something up.\nGumshoe:\nAh! That's! That's Ms. von Karma's receiver! Ugh. Thanks to her, I had the most awful experience of my life, sir! I can't believe she stuck a tracking device on me...\nEdgeworth:\nThat's odd. Even though you're standing right here... The tracking device seems to be in a different location.\nGumshoe:\nOh... It's probably busted or something, sir.\nEdgeworth:\n... ...Well, it doesn't matter. I'm afraid it's about time for me to excuse myself. I still have some work to do.\nMaya:\nHuh!? But Mr. Edgeworth! You haven't even eaten anything yet!\nPhoenix:\n(And you've eaten way too much, you glutton!)\nEdgeworth:\nI had fun tonight. Now, if you'll excuse me...\nPhoenix:\nWait.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat?\nPhoenix:\n... I just want to say... Thanks, Edgeworth. You really saved me out there.\nEdgeworth:\n...Hmph. If anyone should be saying thanks, it should be me, Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(I feel like words alone aren't enough here... I wonder if there's anything I can give him to express how I feel...?)\nEdgeworth:\nYou don't need to thank me. I was only doing my job.\nPearl:\nIt looks like Mr. Edgeworth has left, Mr. Nick. Hey, Mystic Maya?\nMaya:\nHm? Yes, Pearly?\nPearl:\nI guess you two can go back to being lovey-dovey, right? You and Mr. Nick, I mean...\nMaya:\nP-Pearly! Would you cut it out already!? You're embarrassing me!\nPowers:\nUm, anyway... So, who's paying for this lovely dinner party?\nMaya:\nAs if you need to ask! Everyone say, \"Thank you\" to Nick!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nAh, yeah... I'm kinda at the point where I can't even buy instant noodles, pal. So I kinda already put your name on the bill.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Huh?\nLotta:\nYeah, I got me a situation just like that myself. There's this camera shop in this hotel, see... And I just bought myself this good ol' beauty here! It'd better be anyhow for $3,000!\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Huh? Huh?\nLotta:\nActually, I reckon ya bought it for me since it's on yer tab and all.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Huh? Huh? Huh?\nPearl:\nIsn't this great, Mr. Nick!?\nMaya:\nYeah, Nick!\nPhoenix:\n... (Why do I suddenly feel like screaming?)\nLotta:\nAww, ya don't need to hold back now, ya hear?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, pal! Time to let it all out!\nPearl:\nThis is going to be the first time I hear the real you.\nMaya:\nGo on! It's been a while since I heard you say it. I've been busy being a hostage and all.\nPhoenix:\n... Alright then... If you say so.\nPhoenix:\nMaya:\nYou really came through for me, Nick! I had to hide that letter, but I knew you'd find it. I really feel like I've been living on the edge lately. I mean, I've escaped death three times now! Pretty cool, huh? I feel like a pro!\nPearl:\nI'm so happy that you could save Mystic Maya, Mr. Nick! And I'm so happy for the two of you! Speaking of which... I think this hotel is a popular place for honeymooners... (Changed from [Speaking of... I think this hotel is a popular place for honeymooners...] in the original release) So I sort of... made reservations for the two of you... Just in case...\nGumshoe:\nWell, pal. It looks like I'm back on the force again. Mr. Edgeworth had a long talk with the Chief, and he got me reinstated for my sake! I heard he said things like, \"Letting that one go is bad for all of society.\" I knew it! Crashing headlong into everything is the only way to live, pal!\nByrde:\nI, Maggey Byrde, am retiring this uniform as of today, sir! I'm going to be a waitress from now on. And bring smiles and joy to the people who come by the restaurant, sir! I hope you'll stop by sometime, Mr. Wright!\nHotti:\nHmm, yes... Are you here to visit a patient? Hmm... I'm Director Hotti... Hoh, hoh. Recently... Hmm, yes... That girl, you know... I haven't seen her around... Hmm, yes... But I remember... If I even laid so much as an eye on her, it would go, \"Crack!\". Hmm... ...It didn't matter if I got whipped though... Hmm... Hmm, yes... Hoh, hoh.\nMax:\nIt's time to begin our quest of world circus domination sweetie!! And to let the world know we are serious, I plan to make a fabulous flight to Zimbabwe!\nRegina:\nHey Max! What do you think Zimbabwe is like? Do you think there are castles made of cake, and bunnies who can talk...?\nMax:\nI think if there are any talking bunnies, even they won't laugh at Moe's jokes!\nMoe:\nI'm ready! I'm ready! There's no way these jokes are gonna fall on deaf ears. I'm going to be more contemporary with my humor! Moe Curls, R-R-R-Represent!\nTrilo:\nWe've got our new act all worked out! Prepare for the \"Hallelujah Chorus\"!\nBen:\n...\nTrilo:\nSay something will you! You're supposed to start this off! Get on with it...!!\nOldbag:\n...What's this!? Drat, it's just an ordinary electric razor recharging on its stand! I can't believe this. Really! How long do they plan on making me do this!? Ah, but it's Edgey-poo's idea, so that means it must have a deep, hidden meaning. But... Why do I get the feeling... They wouldn't forget about me, would they? Ah, it was never like this in the old days! Everyone thought the world of me! They used to call me Queen Wendy, and treat me like royalty, and any man who hasn't heard about this is going to feel the pain of my heel, yes they're going to feel the burn, and speaking of burn, playing with fire is very dangerous and because of that, three of the warehouses where they stored the scenery were burned right down and that caused a huge stink that\nAndrews:\nI appreciate everything you and Mr. Edgeworth did for me from the bottom of my heart. Oh, that's right. I received a letter from Ms. von Karma. She said that after I get out, I should feel free to consult her about anything at all. I'm really thankful to have met everyone!\nde Killer:\nIt has become difficult for me in this country as of late. As such, I will take a short leave of absence. If you would like to request my services, please be sure to visit my homepage. May we both be blessed with longevity.\nMarch 23, 9:42 PMInternational DeparturesGate 12\nWhere are you going... Franziska?\nvon Karma:\n...! How did you know I was here...?\nEdgeworth:\nWith this.\nvon Karma:\nThat's...\nEdgeworth:\nI heard you were planting things on a certain person. Things like tracking devices in his coat, for example.\nvon Karma:\nHmph. That's just like you. I only planted it there because he was always wearing it. This... filthy, drab coat of his... I don't know how it ended up in my luggage. But it's going in the trash, I promise you that.\nEdgeworth:\nOh, that's right... Speaking of that man... He told me something very interesting.\nGumshoe:\nWhen I ran off with the things from De Killer's hideout... I was sure I took 4 things in total, sir. (Changed from [I was sure I took 4 things total, sir.] in the original release)\nvon Karma:\nFour things...? (Changed from [Four items...?] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\nIt seems he put the last one in his coat pocket.\nvon Karma:\nHe put it in here...? ... It doesn't matter anymore. The case is already over.\nEdgeworth:\n... What are you going to do now?\nvon Karma:\n... That's none of your business.\nEdgeworth:\nAre you running away?\nvon Karma:\nShut up! You don't understand a thing! You can't possibly understand what it means to be \"Manfred von Karma's daughter\"!\nEdgeworth:\nFranziska...\nvon Karma:\nSo many expectations from everyone around me... Expectations I must fulfill! I'm expected to win no matter what. And failure? Such a thing is not an option for me! My father was a genius. There's no doubt about that! But... But me... I'm no genius. I've always known that.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nvon Karma:\nBut I... I had to be one. I had to.\nEdgeworth:\n... You may not be a genius like your father... But... You are a prosecutor. You have been and always will be.\nvon Karma:\n...! No, I'm not... Not anymore. I've even thrown my whip away.\nvon Karma:\n... You haven't changed a bit... You've always... You've always left me alone and walked on ahead without me. Miles Edgeworth... I've always hated you.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nvon Karma:\nAnd then... Finally, my chance to take my revenge on you arrived. If I could win against that man... If I could make Phoenix Wright bow down in defeat... Then this \"girl\" you left behind would have risen higher than you! That was supposed to be my \"revenge\"...\nEdgeworth:\nI see...\nvon Karma:\n... You know, I can't do it... I can't change who I am. I can't throw away everything I've been until today.\nEdgeworth:\nI believe you can. Just like how Adrian Andrews did.\nvon Karma:\nAdrian Andrews...?\nEdgeworth:\nYou were going to use her during the trial, right? But you... You were \"dependant\" on your father by using his tactics. Isn't that right?\nvon Karma:\nHmph!\nEdgeworth:\nToday, you chased after me, after I had left you behind all these years. And that's why we're standing here now, side by side.\nvon Karma:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nBut I have no intention of stopping. If you say you are going to quit your walk down the prosecutor's path... ... Then, this is where we part ways, Franziska von Karma.\nvon Karma:\n... I... I... I am Franziska von Karma. Don't think I'm going to walk in your shadow forever... Our battle... begins now... so you had better prepare yourself, Miles Edgeworth!\nPhoenix Wright... One day... Someday... I'm sure we'll meet again in battle. Until then... This last piece of evidence that never made it to you... I'll take good care of this fourth piece... So I can give it to you... when at last we meet again..."

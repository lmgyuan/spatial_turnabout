(ellipsis and question mark highlighted in the original release)Edgeworth:\nThat's right, Manfred von Karma. He's the best prosecutor there is. He hasn't lost a case in his 40-year career. He is a god of prosecution, Wright! A god!Maya:\nNot a single case?Edgeworth:\nHe'll do anything to get a guilty verdict, anything.Phoenix:\nHmm. Sounds like someone else I know, Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\nHmph. You don't understand. I mean he'll really do anything. Manfred von Karma is a man to be feared.Phoenix:\n(That's quite a claim coming from someone who forges evidence...)Edgeworth:\nHe taught me what it really means to \"prosecute.\"Phoenix:\nWh-what!?Edgeworth:\nJust picture a prosecutor as vicious as me... multiplied by a factor of ten.Maya:\nUgh... So... so was he your teacher, then, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nSomething like that...Maya:\nAnd now he's trying to get you found guilty!? What a creep! Oh, wait... Maybe he's planning on losing on purpose to help you out.Edgeworth:\nNot a chance... He hasn't lost once in 40 years. 40 years! He's as ruthless as me, times twenty!Maya:\nThat's pretty ruthless...Edgeworth:\nLike I said. He's a god among prosecutors.Phoenix:\n(I guess that's something like Mia was to me. Speaking of Mia...) Um, Maya?Maya:\nUh huh?Phoenix:\nWe could really be using Mia's help right now... don't you think?Maya:\nOh...Phoenix:\n?Maya:\nI can't. Sorry. I tried, I really tried, but I couldn't reach.Phoenix:\nYou couldn't \"reach\"?Maya:\nI think it's because I haven't been training. My powers are weak again...Phoenix:\nOh man, what bad timing!Maya:\nI'm really sorry. I'll try my best!Phoenix:\nI hope so!Edgeworth:\nWhat are you whispering about?Phoenix:\nO-oh, it's nothing. Well, it's time. Let's head in...December 26, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Miles Edgeworth.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Karma:\n...Judge:\nErr, Mr. von Karma? Is the prosecution ready?Karma:\n... Fool... You seriously think that I would stand here were I not completely prepared?Judge:\nR-right, my apologies!Phoenix:\n(He's even got the Judge scared!)Judge:\nVery well, your opening statement, please.Karma:\n... Decisive evidence... A decisive witness... What else could possibly be required?Judge:\nAh... er, nothing of course. That should be fine. The prosecution may call its first witness.Maya:\nWhat's with this guy? Is he royalty or something?Phoenix:\nHow am I supposed to fight against this!?Karma:\nI call the detective in charge of this case, Detective Dick Gumshoe.Phoenix:\n(Okay, Gumshoe's first... Let's see how this goes.)Karma:\nDescribe the incident. Now!Gumshoe:\nY-yessir!Phoenix:\n(Detective Gumshoe looks nervous...)Gumshoe:\nEr, please take a look at the map. The murder happened late Christmas Eve, around midnight. There was one boat in the very middle of the lake. There were two men on the boat. Now, there happened to be a woman camping here on the edge of the lake. At 12:10 AM, she heard two pistol shots. Then the boat started to move. It went towards the boat rental shop.Karma:\nHmm.Overhead Map added to the Court Record.Karma:\nTestify to the court about your arrest. Now!Judge:\nW-w-wait! Mr. von Karma...Karma:\nYes?Judge:\nActually, I'm the one that's supposed to be handling these proceedings...Karma:\nWrong. There is only one thing you need to do here. You will slam down your gavel and say the word \"guilty.\" That is your role!Judge:\nY-yes, of course. You're quite right.Phoenix:\n(No, he's not!!!)Witness Testimony-- The Arrest of Edgeworth --Gumshoe:\nA man called into the station around 30 minutes after midnight.\nWe headed to the scene of the crime as fast as we could.\nThat's where we found Mr. Edgeworth.\nNow, I didn't suspect him of anything at all.\nBut... the next morning, a body was found in the lake.\nSo we had to arrest Mr. Edgeworth.Judge:\nHmm... I see. Very well...Karma:\nBegin your cross-examination, attorney. Now!Judge:\n...Cross Examination-- The Arrest of Edgeworth --Gumshoe:\nA man called into the station around 30 minutes after midnight.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou received a call from a \"man\"?\nGumshoe:\nEr... yup.\nPhoenix:\nBut you said there was a woman camping there? She was the one who heard the two gunshots, right?\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nThat woman and the \"man\" who called in the report are two different people, obviously!\nPhoenix:\nDifferent people?\nKarma:\nThere were two witnesses!\nPhoenix:\n(Urk!)\nKarma:\nTheir testimonies were quite similar however. Today I've summoned the woman who was camping.\nPhoenix:\n(The woman who was camping... Lotta Hart.)\nKarma:\nWhat happened next, Detective?Gumshoe:\nWe headed to the scene of the crime as fast as we could.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow long was it between receiving the report and your arrival at the lake?\nGumshoe:\nEr, well... I'd say it was about three minutes.\nPhoenix:\nThat's pretty fast!\nGumshoe:\nOur motto for the month is \"get there quick.\"\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nDetective! You will refrain from casually revealing department secrets!\nGumshoe:\nY-yessir! Sorry, sir!\nKarma:\nDo that, and you'll be able to look forward to your next salary review.\nGumshoe:\nSo much to look forward to, these days...\nKarma:\nThis is no time for daydreaming! Continue!\nGumshoe:\nY-yessir!Gumshoe:\nThat's where we found Mr. Edgeworth.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat was Mr. Edgeworth like when you saw him then?\nGumshoe:\nWell... From what I saw, he looked pretty relaxed. Not like a murderer at all, really.\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nDetective! The court requires the facts, NOT your opinion! How many years have you been on the force!? Facts only, Detective! Hard, cold, objective facts!\nGumshoe:\nY-y-yessir!\nPhoenix:\n(Man, he's got his share of objections...)Gumshoe:\nNow, I didn't suspect him of anything at all.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy didn't you think he was suspicious?\nGumshoe:\nYou should know! We have a deep, trusting relationship with the prosecutors.\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nDetective! The court isn't interested in your musings! \"Deep\"? \"Trusting\"? Poppycock! I've never heard so many flippant comments from an active detective on the force!\nGumshoe:\nMmph!\nPhoenix:\n(Detective Gumshoe doesn't look so good...)\nKarma:\nContinue! Now!Gumshoe:\nBut... the next morning, a body was found in the lake.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid you find any clues on the body?\nGumshoe:\nA single bullet was recovered from the body. He was shot through the heart... fatally.\nKarma:\nJudge! Here's the bullet... It didn't strike bone, so its shape is well preserved.\nJudge:\nVery well. The court accepts this bullet into evidence.\nPistol Bullet added to the Court Record.Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid you find any clues on the body?\nGumshoe:\nA single bullet was recovered from the body. He was shot through the heart... fatally.Gumshoe:\nSo we had to arrest Mr. Edgeworth.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nW-why is that?\nGumshoe:\nWell, we found the murder weapon in the boat.\nPhoenix:\nThe murder weapon...?\nGumshoe:\nA pistol.\nJudge:\nDetective Gumshoe... That is a vital piece of information. Please revise your testimony.\nGumshoe:\nRight! S-sorry, Your Honor.\nChanges statement from \"So we had to arrest Mr. Edgeworth.\" to \"The murder weapon we found in the boat was decisive evidence.\"Gumshoe:\nThe murder weapon we found in the boat was decisive evidence.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat about the pistol made it \"decisive evidence\"?\nKarma:\nTsk tsk tsk...\nPhoenix:\n(Ack! He has the same evil laugh as Edgeworth...)\nGumshoe:\nThere were fingerprints on the pistol found in the boat. They were clear prints from Mr. Edgeworth's right hand.\nPhoenix:\nWh-what!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! So Mr. Edgeworth's fingerprints were found on the murder weapon!?\nGumshoe:\nY-yes, Your Honor.\nKarma:\nJudge! This is the weapon in question.\nJudge:\nA-accepted into evidence.\nPistol added to the Court Record.Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat about the pistol made it \"decisive evidence\"?\nKarma:\nTsk tsk tsk...\nPhoenix:\n(Ack! He has the same evil laugh as Edgeworth...)\nGumshoe:\nThere were fingerprints on the pistol found in the boat. They were clear prints from Mr. Edgeworth's right hand.\nPhoenix:\nWh-what!?Maya:\nNick. Doesn't it seem like Detective Gumshoe is being a little vague?Phoenix:\nI bet von Karma is feeding him lines! His testimony's probably filled with landmines just waiting for me to press.Maya:\nWhat do we do?Phoenix:\nGrit our teeth and press, I guess. What else can we do?Maya:\nWell said, Nick! You're the man!After pressing fifth statement and pressing modified sixth statement:Karma:\nMembers of the court... We now have the pistol used in the murder, and the bullet found in the body! Detective!Gumshoe:\nY-y-yessir!Karma:\nWas the bullet found in the body fired from this pistol?Gumshoe:\nYes. The ballistic markings on the bullet match the pistol.Judge:\nHmm...Maya:\nHey, Nick! What does he mean, \"ballistic markings\"?Karma:\nShocking! To imagine someone here does not know something as basic as ballistic markings!Maya:\nN-Nick! He's glaring at me!Karma:\nTsk... very well, I'll explain. Actually, Judge! You do it.Judge:\nEh? M-me? ... Erm, ahem. Ballistic markings are like the \"fingerprints\" of a gun. The barrel leaves distinctive marks on each bullet it fires. You can examine these \"ballistic fingerprints\" to see which gun fired the shot. It's quite accurate.Karma:\nIndeed. This leads to one, inevitable conclusion: the bullet found in the victim's heart... was, without a doubt, fired from this pistol. This pistol which, as you may recall, was covered with the defendant's own fingerprints!Judge:\nO-order! Order!Phoenix:\n(This is bad... This makes it look like Edgeworth did it!)Karma:\nWell, Judge?Judge:\nI'd say it's almost decisive, yes. Honestly, I could declare a verdict at this point. However...Karma:\nYou wish to hear the witness speak, no doubt. Very well. I am somewhat fatigued, and so I will take a brief break. I will call my witness after the recess. Which will last ten minutes. Judge!Judge:\nY-yes?Karma:\nWhat are you doing? A ten minute recess! Now!Judge:\nB-but, wait, I...Karma:\nJust bang your flimsy gavel and get on with it, man!Judge:\nY-yes! Ahem. This court will take a ten minute recess.Phoenix:\n(Who's running this court, anyway!?)December 26, 11:09 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2Phoenix:\nEdgeworth! What's going on here!? Your fingerprints were on the murder weapon!Edgeworth:\nUh... hmm...Phoenix:\nAnd that foggy photo makes one thing clear... The only one who could have shot that man was the person in the photo!Edgeworth:\nTrue...Phoenix:\nWas that you in the boat?Edgeworth:\n... Yes. It was me.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Edgeworth:\nBut... you must believe me. I didn't shoot him.Phoenix:\nTh-then who did!?Edgeworth:\nI... don't know.Phoenix:\nYou don't know!? Weren't you right there!?Edgeworth:\n... I heard a gunshot from very close by. Then... the other man fell from the boat. I can't say why, but... I thought, at the time, that he had shot himself!Phoenix:\nY-you mean it was a suicide!?Edgeworth:\n... That's the only explanation I can come up with.Phoenix:\nHuh... (How am I going to convince anyone of that!?) Say, Maya?Maya:\nHuh? Wh-what?Phoenix:\nAny progress with Mia?Maya:\nOh... Sorry. It's no good.Phoenix:\nUgh...Maya:\nI know... I'm no good for anything, am I, Nick? If I can't call my sister, I might as well not be here, right?No, I need you here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nNo, of course not, I need you here! I can see you're always trying to help out. Even if you don't actually help... it's the thought that counts, right?\nMaya:\nIt's okay Nick, you don't have to make me feel better.\nLeads to:\n\"I don't know anything about trials, or defense...\"Yeah, you're useless\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm, well, actually... (You don't know law, you don't have any trial experience or techniques... Yeah, you're pretty much useless... but I can't say that!)\nMaya:\nIt's okay Nick. You don't have to say anything. Your face said it for you.\nPhoenix:\n(Whoops!) N-no, o-of course we... I'm sorry.\nMaya:\nIt's okay Nick.\nLeads to:\n\"I don't know anything about trials, or defense...\"Maya:\nI don't know anything about trials, or defense... What's more, I'm a spirit medium who can't even contact spirits...Phoenix:\nAww, everyone has their off days! I mean, I've just been getting lucky lately... But you never know when my luck is going to run out!Maya:\nReally...?Edgeworth:\nW-w-whoa! Wright! Don't jinx this case any worse than it already is! It's bad for my heart...Phoenix:\nOh? Oh! S-sorry... (Whoops!)Judge:\nCourt is back in session. Mr. von Karma, call your witness.Karma:\nYes. Will Ms. Lotta Hart take the stand?Karma:\nLotta Hart, you are a research student at a university?Lotta:\nThat I am.Karma:\nGood. Begin by telling us what you saw the night of the incident. And don't add anything trivial or subjective. Understand?Lotta:\n... Y'all need to learn some manners.Karma:\nUNDERSTAND?Lotta:\nY-yeah, I understand, I understand!Judge:\nEr... very well. Your testimony, please.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Lotta:\nIt was Christmas Eve, just after midnight, I reckon.\nI was in my car.\nI heard this \"bang\" come up from the lake.\nWhen I looked out the window, I saw two gents in a boat.\nThen there was another \"bang\"...\nThere wasn't nary a thing on the lake but that boat.Karma:\nEnough.Lotta:\nHuh?Karma:\nJudge! She happened to take a photo of the incident! This is that photo. Accept it as evidence.Judge:\nW-well! This is a surprise! This looks like... the very moment of the murder! O-Order! I will remove you from the court if I do not have order immediately!Karma:\nAs the witness testified, she looked at the lake when she heard the shot. There were no other boats on that lake! So, the man in the boat with the victim must have been the one who shot him... Yes. It was the defendant, Miles Edgeworth!!!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order...! I will have order!Karma:\n... Well, Judge?Judge:\nThe evidence is... decisive. I have very little doubt about this case. Very well, this court finds the defendant...Phoenix:Phoenix:\nW-wait! Your Honor! I haven't cross-examined the witness yet!Karma:\nA cross-examination? We have photographic proof! What question can there possibly be!? This photo is worth a thousand words... and they all read \"guilty\"! You lose. Or... Do you claim to have found a contradiction in her testimony!?Phoenix:\n...!Karma:\nVery well. If you have to, you may cross-examine the witness. You will only flounder and ask meaningless questions! You will fail to find anything! And then, I will have you held in contempt of court!Maya:\nUh, Nick... contempt...?Phoenix:\n\"Contempt of court,\" you know?Maya:\nI... guess I understand. Well... what are you going to do? Do you really think there was a contradiction with the facts in her testimony?I think there was\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI... think I noticed one little thing...\nMaya:\nWow, I'm impressed, Nick! I didn't notice anything! Right! Let's take him on!\nPhoenix:\nY-yeah... (I got a bad feeling about this...)\nLeads to:\n\"I understand... I will cross-examine the witness!\"I think there wasn't\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHonestly, I found nothing.\nMaya:\nI dunno, I thought her testimony was strange. She was so vague about everything!\nPhoenix:\nI bet von Karma probably fed her her lines.\nMaya:\nBut... But if you don't cross-examine her, the judge will...\nPhoenix:\nHe'll bang down that \"flimsy gavel\" of his and declare Edgeworth guilty.\nMaya:\nI guess we'll just have to bluff it.\nPhoenix:\nBut if we mess up... contempt of court.\nMaya:\nHey, if we lose we'll be held in public contempt!\nPhoenix:\nEr... right.\nLeads to:\n\"I understand... I will cross-examine the witness!\"Phoenix:\nI understand... I will cross-examine the witness!Karma:\nTsk tsk tsk... Very well!Judge:\nI pray for your sake this isn't a waste of time.Cross Examination-- Witness's Account --Lotta:\nIt was Christmas Eve, just after midnight, I reckon.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Just after midnight,\" you say? In other words, it was no longer Christmas Eve... but Christmas Day!\nLotta:\nHuh? Uh, yeah, well, yes.\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nI know you want to find contradictions, but really!\nPhoenix:\nMmmph.\nJudge:\nI hope your next contradiction is a little more relevant to the trial.Lotta:\nI was in my car.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy were you camping there, anyway?\nLotta:\nI'm a research student at my university. I was taking pictures to use in my research.\nPhoenix:\n(What research? This all sounds suspicious...)\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMs. Hart. Could you be more specific about your \"research\"?\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nWhat does the witness's motive in camping by the lake have to do with this case!? The answer \"is nothing\"! I object to this line of questioning! Objection sustained!\nJudge:\nW-w-wait, now, I'm the one who says that!\nKarma:\nWell, then say it already!\nJudge:\nObjection sustained.\nPhoenix:\n(Thanks for nothing, Your Honor...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nHold back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I think I'll let that one slide for now.)\nLeads back to cross-examinationLotta:\nI heard this \"bang\" come up from the lake.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, you weren't looking at the lake at that time?\nLotta:\nNope. I looked after I heard that noise.\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nShe's said that already! I asked you to find \"contradictions\"! Not leisurely chat with the witness!\nPhoenix:\n(Urk...)Lotta:\nWhen I looked out the window, I saw two gents in a boat.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nCould you clearly see the two men?\nLotta:\nJust look at the picture! Clear enough for you?\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh...)\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWait a second! I wasn't asking you about the photo! I was asking if YOU saw the two men!\nLotta:\nUh, yeah, well, of course...\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nThe witness has testified that she saw them! There's also a photo! You'd best look elsewhere for your precious contradictions!\nPhoenix:\n(He jumped in quick... He's hiding something!)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nHold back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I think I'd best let that one slide...)\nLeads back to cross-examinationLotta:\nThen there was another \"bang\"...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWere you watching the very moment the shot rang out?\nLotta:\nWell, yeah, sure...\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nYou're asking meaningless questions! Meaningless! \"Contradictions,\" Mr. Wright. Not meaningless babble!\nPhoenix:\n(von Karma, I think I hate you. He's trying to keep me from talking to the witness... To what end...?)Lotta:\nThere wasn't nary a thing on the lake but that boat.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure about that?\nLotta:\nYeah, sure as a country gal can be!\nPhoenix:\n(That sounds pretty sure.)\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHow come you're so sure?\nLotta:\nWell, heck, I scanned the whole lake.\nPhoenix:\n(\"Scanned the whole lake\"?

(ellipsis and question mark highlighted in the original release)Edgeworth:\nThat's right, Manfred von Karma. He's the best prosecutor there is. He hasn't lost a case in his 40-year career. He is a god of prosecution, Wright! A god!Maya:\nNot a single case?Edgeworth:\nHe'll do anything to get a guilty verdict, anything.Phoenix:\nHmm. Sounds like someone else I know, Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\nHmph. You don't understand. I mean he'll really do anything. Manfred von Karma is a man to be feared.Phoenix:\n(That's quite a claim coming from someone who forges evidence...)Edgeworth:\nHe taught me what it really means to \"prosecute.\"Phoenix:\nWh-what!?Edgeworth:\nJust picture a prosecutor as vicious as me... multiplied by a factor of ten.Maya:\nUgh... So... so was he your teacher, then, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nSomething like that...Maya:\nAnd now he's trying to get you found guilty!? What a creep! Oh, wait... Maybe he's planning on losing on purpose to help you out.Edgeworth:\nNot a chance... He hasn't lost once in 40 years. 40 years! He's as ruthless as me, times twenty!Maya:\nThat's pretty ruthless...Edgeworth:\nLike I said. He's a god among prosecutors.Phoenix:\n(I guess that's something like Mia was to me. Speaking of Mia...) Um, Maya?Maya:\nUh huh?Phoenix:\nWe could really be using Mia's help right now... don't you think?Maya:\nOh...Phoenix:\n?Maya:\nI can't. Sorry. I tried, I really tried, but I couldn't reach.Phoenix:\nYou couldn't \"reach\"?Maya:\nI think it's because I haven't been training. My powers are weak again...Phoenix:\nOh man, what bad timing!Maya:\nI'm really sorry. I'll try my best!Phoenix:\nI hope so!Edgeworth:\nWhat are you whispering about?Phoenix:\nO-oh, it's nothing. Well, it's time. Let's head in...December 26, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Miles Edgeworth.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Karma:\n...Judge:\nErr, Mr. von Karma? Is the prosecution ready?Karma:\n... Fool... You seriously think that I would stand here were I not completely prepared?Judge:\nR-right, my apologies!Phoenix:\n(He's even got the Judge scared!)Judge:\nVery well, your opening statement, please.Karma:\n... Decisive evidence... A decisive witness... What else could possibly be required?Judge:\nAh... er, nothing of course. That should be fine. The prosecution may call its first witness.Maya:\nWhat's with this guy? Is he royalty or something?Phoenix:\nHow am I supposed to fight against this!?Karma:\nI call the detective in charge of this case, Detective Dick Gumshoe.Phoenix:\n(Okay, Gumshoe's first... Let's see how this goes.)Karma:\nDescribe the incident. Now!Gumshoe:\nY-yessir!Phoenix:\n(Detective Gumshoe looks nervous...)Gumshoe:\nEr, please take a look at the map. The murder happened late Christmas Eve, around midnight. There was one boat in the very middle of the lake. There were two men on the boat. Now, there happened to be a woman camping here on the edge of the lake. At 12:10 AM, she heard two pistol shots. Then the boat started to move. It went towards the boat rental shop.Karma:\nHmm.Overhead Map added to the Court Record.Karma:\nTestify to the court about your arrest. Now!Judge:\nW-w-wait! Mr. von Karma...Karma:\nYes?Judge:\nActually, I'm the one that's supposed to be handling these proceedings...Karma:\nWrong. There is only one thing you need to do here. You will slam down your gavel and say the word \"guilty.\" That is your role!Judge:\nY-yes, of course. You're quite right.Phoenix:\n(No, he's not!!!)Witness Testimony-- The Arrest of Edgeworth --Gumshoe:\nA man called into the station around 30 minutes after midnight.\nWe headed to the scene of the crime as fast as we could.\nThat's where we found Mr. Edgeworth.\nNow, I didn't suspect him of anything at all.\nBut... the next morning, a body was found in the lake.\nSo we had to arrest Mr. Edgeworth.Judge:\nHmm... I see. Very well...Karma:\nBegin your cross-examination, attorney. Now!Judge:\n...Cross Examination-- The Arrest of Edgeworth --Gumshoe:\nA man called into the station around 30 minutes after midnight.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou received a call from a \"man\"?\nGumshoe:\nEr... yup.\nPhoenix:\nBut you said there was a woman camping there? She was the one who heard the two gunshots, right?\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nThat woman and the \"man\" who called in the report are two different people, obviously!\nPhoenix:\nDifferent people?\nKarma:\nThere were two witnesses!\nPhoenix:\n(Urk!)\nKarma:\nTheir testimonies were quite similar however. Today I've summoned the woman who was camping.\nPhoenix:\n(The woman who was camping... Lotta Hart.)\nKarma:\nWhat happened next, Detective?Gumshoe:\nWe headed to the scene of the crime as fast as we could.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow long was it between receiving the report and your arrival at the lake?\nGumshoe:\nEr, well... I'd say it was about three minutes.\nPhoenix:\nThat's pretty fast!\nGumshoe:\nOur motto for the month is \"get there quick.\"\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nDetective! You will refrain from casually revealing department secrets!\nGumshoe:\nY-yessir! Sorry, sir!\nKarma:\nDo that, and you'll be able to look forward to your next salary review.\nGumshoe:\nSo much to look forward to, these days...\nKarma:\nThis is no time for daydreaming! Continue!\nGumshoe:\nY-yessir!Gumshoe:\nThat's where we found Mr. Edgeworth.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat was Mr. Edgeworth like when you saw him then?\nGumshoe:\nWell... From what I saw, he looked pretty relaxed. Not like a murderer at all, really.\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nDetective! The court requires the facts, NOT your opinion! How many years have you been on the force!? Facts only, Detective! Hard, cold, objective facts!\nGumshoe:\nY-y-yessir!\nPhoenix:\n(Man, he's got his share of objections...)Gumshoe:\nNow, I didn't suspect him of anything at all.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy didn't you think he was suspicious?\nGumshoe:\nYou should know! We have a deep, trusting relationship with the prosecutors.\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nDetective! The court isn't interested in your musings! \"Deep\"? \"Trusting\"? Poppycock! I've never heard so many flippant comments from an active detective on the force!\nGumshoe:\nMmph!\nPhoenix:\n(Detective Gumshoe doesn't look so good...)\nKarma:\nContinue! Now!Gumshoe:\nBut... the next morning, a body was found in the lake.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid you find any clues on the body?\nGumshoe:\nA single bullet was recovered from the body. He was shot through the heart... fatally.\nKarma:\nJudge! Here's the bullet... It didn't strike bone, so its shape is well preserved.\nJudge:\nVery well. The court accepts this bullet into evidence.\nPistol Bullet added to the Court Record.Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid you find any clues on the body?\nGumshoe:\nA single bullet was recovered from the body. He was shot through the heart... fatally.Gumshoe:\nSo we had to arrest Mr. Edgeworth.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nW-why is that?\nGumshoe:\nWell, we found the murder weapon in the boat.\nPhoenix:\nThe murder weapon...?\nGumshoe:\nA pistol.\nJudge:\nDetective Gumshoe... That is a vital piece of information. Please revise your testimony.\nGumshoe:\nRight! S-sorry, Your Honor.\nChanges statement from \"So we had to arrest Mr. Edgeworth.\" to \"The murder weapon we found in the boat was decisive evidence.\"Gumshoe:\nThe murder weapon we found in the boat was decisive evidence.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat about the pistol made it \"decisive evidence\"?\nKarma:\nTsk tsk tsk...\nPhoenix:\n(Ack! He has the same evil laugh as Edgeworth...)\nGumshoe:\nThere were fingerprints on the pistol found in the boat. They were clear prints from Mr. Edgeworth's right hand.\nPhoenix:\nWh-what!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! So Mr. Edgeworth's fingerprints were found on the murder weapon!?\nGumshoe:\nY-yes, Your Honor.\nKarma:\nJudge! This is the weapon in question.\nJudge:\nA-accepted into evidence.\nPistol added to the Court Record.Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat about the pistol made it \"decisive evidence\"?\nKarma:\nTsk tsk tsk...\nPhoenix:\n(Ack! He has the same evil laugh as Edgeworth...)\nGumshoe:\nThere were fingerprints on the pistol found in the boat. They were clear prints from Mr. Edgeworth's right hand.\nPhoenix:\nWh-what!?Maya:\nNick. Doesn't it seem like Detective Gumshoe is being a little vague?Phoenix:\nI bet von Karma is feeding him lines! His testimony's probably filled with landmines just waiting for me to press.Maya:\nWhat do we do?Phoenix:\nGrit our teeth and press, I guess. What else can we do?Maya:\nWell said, Nick! You're the man!After pressing fifth statement and pressing modified sixth statement:Karma:\nMembers of the court... We now have the pistol used in the murder, and the bullet found in the body! Detective!Gumshoe:\nY-y-yessir!Karma:\nWas the bullet found in the body fired from this pistol?Gumshoe:\nYes. The ballistic markings on the bullet match the pistol.Judge:\nHmm...Maya:\nHey, Nick! What does he mean, \"ballistic markings\"?Karma:\nShocking! To imagine someone here does not know something as basic as ballistic markings!Maya:\nN-Nick! He's glaring at me!Karma:\nTsk... very well, I'll explain. Actually, Judge! You do it.Judge:\nEh? M-me? ... Erm, ahem. Ballistic markings are like the \"fingerprints\" of a gun. The barrel leaves distinctive marks on each bullet it fires. You can examine these \"ballistic fingerprints\" to see which gun fired the shot. It's quite accurate.Karma:\nIndeed. This leads to one, inevitable conclusion: the bullet found in the victim's heart... was, without a doubt, fired from this pistol. This pistol which, as you may recall, was covered with the defendant's own fingerprints!Judge:\nO-order! Order!Phoenix:\n(This is bad... This makes it look like Edgeworth did it!)Karma:\nWell, Judge?Judge:\nI'd say it's almost decisive, yes. Honestly, I could declare a verdict at this point. However...Karma:\nYou wish to hear the witness speak, no doubt. Very well. I am somewhat fatigued, and so I will take a brief break. I will call my witness after the recess. Which will last ten minutes. Judge!Judge:\nY-yes?Karma:\nWhat are you doing? A ten minute recess! Now!Judge:\nB-but, wait, I...Karma:\nJust bang your flimsy gavel and get on with it, man!Judge:\nY-yes! Ahem. This court will take a ten minute recess.Phoenix:\n(Who's running this court, anyway!?)December 26, 11:09 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2Phoenix:\nEdgeworth! What's going on here!? Your fingerprints were on the murder weapon!Edgeworth:\nUh... hmm...Phoenix:\nAnd that foggy photo makes one thing clear... The only one who could have shot that man was the person in the photo!Edgeworth:\nTrue...Phoenix:\nWas that you in the boat?Edgeworth:\n... Yes. It was me.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Edgeworth:\nBut... you must believe me. I didn't shoot him.Phoenix:\nTh-then who did!?Edgeworth:\nI... don't know.Phoenix:\nYou don't know!? Weren't you right there!?Edgeworth:\n... I heard a gunshot from very close by. Then... the other man fell from the boat. I can't say why, but... I thought, at the time, that he had shot himself!Phoenix:\nY-you mean it was a suicide!?Edgeworth:\n... That's the only explanation I can come up with.Phoenix:\nHuh... (How am I going to convince anyone of that!?) Say, Maya?Maya:\nHuh? Wh-what?Phoenix:\nAny progress with Mia?Maya:\nOh... Sorry. It's no good.Phoenix:\nUgh...Maya:\nI know... I'm no good for anything, am I, Nick? If I can't call my sister, I might as well not be here, right?No, I need you here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nNo, of course not, I need you here! I can see you're always trying to help out. Even if you don't actually help... it's the thought that counts, right?\nMaya:\nIt's okay Nick, you don't have to make me feel better.\nLeads to:\n\"I don't know anything about trials, or defense...\"Yeah, you're useless\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm, well, actually... (You don't know law, you don't have any trial experience or techniques... Yeah, you're pretty much useless... but I can't say that!)\nMaya:\nIt's okay Nick. You don't have to say anything. Your face said it for you.\nPhoenix:\n(Whoops!) N-no, o-of course we... I'm sorry.\nMaya:\nIt's okay Nick.\nLeads to:\n\"I don't know anything about trials, or defense...\"Maya:\nI don't know anything about trials, or defense... What's more, I'm a spirit medium who can't even contact spirits...Phoenix:\nAww, everyone has their off days! I mean, I've just been getting lucky lately... But you never know when my luck is going to run out!Maya:\nReally...?Edgeworth:\nW-w-whoa! Wright! Don't jinx this case any worse than it already is! It's bad for my heart...Phoenix:\nOh? Oh! S-sorry... (Whoops!)Judge:\nCourt is back in session. Mr. von Karma, call your witness.Karma:\nYes. Will Ms. Lotta Hart take the stand?Karma:\nLotta Hart, you are a research student at a university?Lotta:\nThat I am.Karma:\nGood. Begin by telling us what you saw the night of the incident. And don't add anything trivial or subjective. Understand?Lotta:\n... Y'all need to learn some manners.Karma:\nUNDERSTAND?Lotta:\nY-yeah, I understand, I understand!Judge:\nEr... very well. Your testimony, please.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Lotta:\nIt was Christmas Eve, just after midnight, I reckon.\nI was in my car.\nI heard this \"bang\" come up from the lake.\nWhen I looked out the window, I saw two gents in a boat.\nThen there was another \"bang\"...\nThere wasn't nary a thing on the lake but that boat.Karma:\nEnough.Lotta:\nHuh?Karma:\nJudge! She happened to take a photo of the incident! This is that photo. Accept it as evidence.Judge:\nW-well! This is a surprise! This looks like... the very moment of the murder! O-Order! I will remove you from the court if I do not have order immediately!Karma:\nAs the witness testified, she looked at the lake when she heard the shot. There were no other boats on that lake! So, the man in the boat with the victim must have been the one who shot him... Yes. It was the defendant, Miles Edgeworth!!!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order...! I will have order!Karma:\n... Well, Judge?Judge:\nThe evidence is... decisive. I have very little doubt about this case. Very well, this court finds the defendant...Phoenix:Phoenix:\nW-wait! Your Honor! I haven't cross-examined the witness yet!Karma:\nA cross-examination? We have photographic proof! What question can there possibly be!? This photo is worth a thousand words... and they all read \"guilty\"! You lose. Or... Do you claim to have found a contradiction in her testimony!?Phoenix:\n...!Karma:\nVery well. If you have to, you may cross-examine the witness. You will only flounder and ask meaningless questions! You will fail to find anything! And then, I will have you held in contempt of court!Maya:\nUh, Nick... contempt...?Phoenix:\n\"Contempt of court,\" you know?Maya:\nI... guess I understand. Well... what are you going to do? Do you really think there was a contradiction with the facts in her testimony?I think there was\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI... think I noticed one little thing...\nMaya:\nWow, I'm impressed, Nick! I didn't notice anything! Right! Let's take him on!\nPhoenix:\nY-yeah... (I got a bad feeling about this...)\nLeads to:\n\"I understand... I will cross-examine the witness!\"I think there wasn't\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHonestly, I found nothing.\nMaya:\nI dunno, I thought her testimony was strange. She was so vague about everything!\nPhoenix:\nI bet von Karma probably fed her her lines.\nMaya:\nBut... But if you don't cross-examine her, the judge will...\nPhoenix:\nHe'll bang down that \"flimsy gavel\" of his and declare Edgeworth guilty.\nMaya:\nI guess we'll just have to bluff it.\nPhoenix:\nBut if we mess up... contempt of court.\nMaya:\nHey, if we lose we'll be held in public contempt!\nPhoenix:\nEr... right.\nLeads to:\n\"I understand... I will cross-examine the witness!\"Phoenix:\nI understand... I will cross-examine the witness!Karma:\nTsk tsk tsk... Very well!Judge:\nI pray for your sake this isn't a waste of time.Cross Examination-- Witness's Account --Lotta:\nIt was Christmas Eve, just after midnight, I reckon.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Just after midnight,\" you say? In other words, it was no longer Christmas Eve... but Christmas Day!\nLotta:\nHuh? Uh, yeah, well, yes.\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nI know you want to find contradictions, but really!\nPhoenix:\nMmmph.\nJudge:\nI hope your next contradiction is a little more relevant to the trial.Lotta:\nI was in my car.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy were you camping there, anyway?\nLotta:\nI'm a research student at my university. I was taking pictures to use in my research.\nPhoenix:\n(What research? This all sounds suspicious...)\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMs. Hart. Could you be more specific about your \"research\"?\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nWhat does the witness's motive in camping by the lake have to do with this case!? The answer \"is nothing\"! I object to this line of questioning! Objection sustained!\nJudge:\nW-w-wait, now, I'm the one who says that!\nKarma:\nWell, then say it already!\nJudge:\nObjection sustained.\nPhoenix:\n(Thanks for nothing, Your Honor...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nHold back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I think I'll let that one slide for now.)\nLeads back to cross-examinationLotta:\nI heard this \"bang\" come up from the lake.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, you weren't looking at the lake at that time?\nLotta:\nNope. I looked after I heard that noise.\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nShe's said that already! I asked you to find \"contradictions\"! Not leisurely chat with the witness!\nPhoenix:\n(Urk...)Lotta:\nWhen I looked out the window, I saw two gents in a boat.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nCould you clearly see the two men?\nLotta:\nJust look at the picture! Clear enough for you?\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh...)\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWait a second! I wasn't asking you about the photo! I was asking if YOU saw the two men!\nLotta:\nUh, yeah, well, of course...\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nThe witness has testified that she saw them! There's also a photo! You'd best look elsewhere for your precious contradictions!\nPhoenix:\n(He jumped in quick... He's hiding something!)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nHold back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I think I'd best let that one slide...)\nLeads back to cross-examinationLotta:\nThen there was another \"bang\"...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWere you watching the very moment the shot rang out?\nLotta:\nWell, yeah, sure...\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nYou're asking meaningless questions! Meaningless! \"Contradictions,\" Mr. Wright. Not meaningless babble!\nPhoenix:\n(von Karma, I think I hate you. He's trying to keep me from talking to the witness... To what end...?)Lotta:\nThere wasn't nary a thing on the lake but that boat.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure about that?\nLotta:\nYeah, sure as a country gal can be!\nPhoenix:\n(That sounds pretty sure.)\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHow come you're so sure?\nLotta:\nWell, heck, I scanned the whole lake.\nPhoenix:\n(\"Scanned the whole lake\"? It almost sounds like she was more interested in the lake than the boat...) Ms. Hart... you--\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nMr. Wright! The witness has answered the question in full.\nPhoenix:\nMmph!\nKarma:\nNo need for further questions! Objection sustained!\nJudge:\nU-uh, that's what I'm...\nKarma:\nSustained!\nJudge:\nY-yes, of course.\nPhoenix:\n(Oh great... What am I supposed to do now?)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nHold back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Lotta seems pretty sure of herself. I'd better not forge blindly ahead here. Still... this whole thing stinks.)\nLeads back to cross-examinationPhoenix:\n(Th-there weren't any contradictions in there!)Maya:\nSorry, Nick. If only my sister were here...Phoenix:\n(Maya's really taking this hard.)After selecting \"Press further\" upon pressing second, fourth, and sixth statements, and pressing fifth statement:Judge:\nEnough! I think we've heard all we need to hear, Mr. Wright. It seems you are unable to find a contradiction in the testimony worth noting.Phoenix:\nB-but, Your Honor!Karma:\nYou keep your promise!Judge:\nMr. Wright. I am afraid that I will have to penalize any further outbursts... By holding you in contempt of court!Karma:\nAnd if that happens, you'll have to leave the courtroom immediately! Understood...?Phoenix:\nUh... uh huh.Maya:\nNick...! Lotta's testimony is fishy, Nick! Real fishy!Phoenix:\nI... know what you mean. But... If I can't say anything, what can I do?Judge:\nI believe we've covered the evidence sufficiently to make a decision.Karma:\nThen, pass your judgment!Judge:\nVery well. Mr. Miles Edgeworth, please take the stand.???:Judge:\nWh-who was that!?Maya:\nIt... was me.Phoenix:\n(Maya!)Judge:\nI-is something wrong? D-do you need to use the facilities?Maya:\nNo, I do not! Lotta Hart! Your testimony stinks! It's unclear whether you were actually looking at the lake! It's highly doubtful that you actually say Mr. Edgeworth! Tell us the truth! This is a matter of life or death!Lotta:\n...!Maya:\nLotta! Did you really clearly see Mr. Edgeworth that night!? Did you see him fire that pistol!?Judge:\nYou will stand down! The court does not acknowledge the defense's outburst!Maya:\nAnswer me, Lotta!Lotta:\nWhat's the big idea, treating me like some kind of criminal!? I saw him! I swear it! I saw Edgeworth...Karma:Karma:\nEnough! Judge... Declare the defense in contempt of court!Judge:\nY-yes... yes, of course. I'm sorry, but you WERE warned. Guard! Escort Mr. Wright out of the courtroom! He is in contempt of court, and must leave.Phoenix:\n(No... No...!)Wait!Maya:\nI-I was the one who made the outburst, Your Honor! Nick is innocent!Karma:\nHah! What's the difference? All that remains is for the guilty verdict to be declared! Isn't that right, Mr. Phoenix Wright!?Wrong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWrong!\nKarma:\nWhat!?\nLeads to:\n\"Did you hear what Ms. Hart just said?\"Right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Dammit, he's right...)\nMaya:\nN-Nick! There must be something we can do!\nPhoenix:\nI... don't think there is. The cross-examination is over already!\nMaya:\nB-but... but didn't Lotta just say she saw him? She did, Nick! She just said that she saw Mr. Edgeworth! She didn't say that in her testimony, did she?\nPhoenix:\n...! Y-you're right! Your Honor!\nLeads to:\n\"Did you hear what Ms. Hart just said?\"Phoenix:\nDid you hear what Ms. Hart just said? She said she clearly saw Mr. Edgeworth! That was not in the testimony! That changes her testimony, and I have a right to cross-examine her again!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! Order! Order! Order!Karma:\nYou're in contempt of court! It's too late for wild claims! Judge! Sustain my objection!Judge:\n... ... I'm sorry, Mr. von Karma, but I cannot.Karma:\nWhat!?Judge:\nMs. Lotta Hart has made a new testimony. The defense does have a right to cross-examine her again.Karma:\nB-but he is in contempt of court!Maya:\nNo, I am! If you're going to arrest someone, arrest me!Judge:\nHmm... Very well. Maya Fey! You will leave the courtroom immediately.Maya:\nNick! I did what I could... You have to do the rest! Good luck!Phoenix:\nM-Maya...!Karma:\nPeh! I care not for this melodrama! Listen well, Mr. Wright! I do not tolerate badgering of my witnesses!Phoenix:\n(I'm running out of time... I'd better find a contradiction in here or else...)Judge:\nMr. Wright!

(ellipsis and question mark highlighted in the original release)Edgeworth:\nThat's right, Manfred von Karma. He's the best prosecutor there is. He hasn't lost a case in his 40-year career. He is a god of prosecution, Wright! A god!Maya:\nNot a single case?Edgeworth:\nHe'll do anything to get a guilty verdict, anything.Phoenix:\nHmm. Sounds like someone else I know, Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\nHmph. You don't understand. I mean he'll really do anything. Manfred von Karma is a man to be feared.Phoenix:\n(That's quite a claim coming from someone who forges evidence...)Edgeworth:\nHe taught me what it really means to \"prosecute.\"Phoenix:\nWh-what!?Edgeworth:\nJust picture a prosecutor as vicious as me... multiplied by a factor of ten.Maya:\nUgh... So... so was he your teacher, then, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nSomething like that...Maya:\nAnd now he's trying to get you found guilty!? What a creep! Oh, wait... Maybe he's planning on losing on purpose to help you out.Edgeworth:\nNot a chance... He hasn't lost once in 40 years. 40 years! He's as ruthless as me, times twenty!Maya:\nThat's pretty ruthless...Edgeworth:\nLike I said. He's a god among prosecutors.Phoenix:\n(I guess that's something like Mia was to me. Speaking of Mia...) Um, Maya?Maya:\nUh huh?Phoenix:\nWe could really be using Mia's help right now... don't you think?Maya:\nOh...Phoenix:\n?Maya:\nI can't. Sorry. I tried, I really tried, but I couldn't reach.Phoenix:\nYou couldn't \"reach\"?Maya:\nI think it's because I haven't been training. My powers are weak again...Phoenix:\nOh man, what bad timing!Maya:\nI'm really sorry. I'll try my best!Phoenix:\nI hope so!Edgeworth:\nWhat are you whispering about?Phoenix:\nO-oh, it's nothing. Well, it's time. Let's head in...December 26, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Miles Edgeworth.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Karma:\n...Judge:\nErr, Mr. von Karma? Is the prosecution ready?Karma:\n... Fool... You seriously think that I would stand here were I not completely prepared?Judge:\nR-right, my apologies!Phoenix:\n(He's even got the Judge scared!)Judge:\nVery well, your opening statement, please.Karma:\n... Decisive evidence... A decisive witness... What else could possibly be required?Judge:\nAh... er, nothing of course. That should be fine. The prosecution may call its first witness.Maya:\nWhat's with this guy? Is he royalty or something?Phoenix:\nHow am I supposed to fight against this!?Karma:\nI call the detective in charge of this case, Detective Dick Gumshoe.Phoenix:\n(Okay, Gumshoe's first... Let's see how this goes.)Karma:\nDescribe the incident. Now!Gumshoe:\nY-yessir!Phoenix:\n(Detective Gumshoe looks nervous...)Gumshoe:\nEr, please take a look at the map. The murder happened late Christmas Eve, around midnight. There was one boat in the very middle of the lake. There were two men on the boat. Now, there happened to be a woman camping here on the edge of the lake. At 12:10 AM, she heard two pistol shots. Then the boat started to move. It went towards the boat rental shop.Karma:\nHmm.Overhead Map added to the Court Record.Karma:\nTestify to the court about your arrest. Now!Judge:\nW-w-wait! Mr. von Karma...Karma:\nYes?Judge:\nActually, I'm the one that's supposed to be handling these proceedings...Karma:\nWrong. There is only one thing you need to do here. You will slam down your gavel and say the word \"guilty.\" That is your role!Judge:\nY-yes, of course. You're quite right.Phoenix:\n(No, he's not!!!)Witness Testimony-- The Arrest of Edgeworth --Gumshoe:\nA man called into the station around 30 minutes after midnight.\nWe headed to the scene of the crime as fast as we could.\nThat's where we found Mr. Edgeworth.\nNow, I didn't suspect him of anything at all.\nBut... the next morning, a body was found in the lake.\nSo we had to arrest Mr. Edgeworth.Judge:\nHmm... I see. Very well...Karma:\nBegin your cross-examination, attorney. Now!Judge:\n...Cross Examination-- The Arrest of Edgeworth --Gumshoe:\nA man called into the station around 30 minutes after midnight.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou received a call from a \"man\"?\nGumshoe:\nEr... yup.\nPhoenix:\nBut you said there was a woman camping there? She was the one who heard the two gunshots, right?\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nThat woman and the \"man\" who called in the report are two different people, obviously!\nPhoenix:\nDifferent people?\nKarma:\nThere were two witnesses!\nPhoenix:\n(Urk!)\nKarma:\nTheir testimonies were quite similar however. Today I've summoned the woman who was camping.\nPhoenix:\n(The woman who was camping... Lotta Hart.)\nKarma:\nWhat happened next, Detective?Gumshoe:\nWe headed to the scene of the crime as fast as we could.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow long was it between receiving the report and your arrival at the lake?\nGumshoe:\nEr, well... I'd say it was about three minutes.\nPhoenix:\nThat's pretty fast!\nGumshoe:\nOur motto for the month is \"get there quick.\"\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nDetective! You will refrain from casually revealing department secrets!\nGumshoe:\nY-yessir! Sorry, sir!\nKarma:\nDo that, and you'll be able to look forward to your next salary review.\nGumshoe:\nSo much to look forward to, these days...\nKarma:\nThis is no time for daydreaming! Continue!\nGumshoe:\nY-yessir!Gumshoe:\nThat's where we found Mr. Edgeworth.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat was Mr. Edgeworth like when you saw him then?\nGumshoe:\nWell... From what I saw, he looked pretty relaxed. Not like a murderer at all, really.\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nDetective! The court requires the facts, NOT your opinion! How many years have you been on the force!? Facts only, Detective! Hard, cold, objective facts!\nGumshoe:\nY-y-yessir!\nPhoenix:\n(Man, he's got his share of objections...)Gumshoe:\nNow, I didn't suspect him of anything at all.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy didn't you think he was suspicious?\nGumshoe:\nYou should know! We have a deep, trusting relationship with the prosecutors.\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nDetective! The court isn't interested in your musings! \"Deep\"? \"Trusting\"? Poppycock! I've never heard so many flippant comments from an active detective on the force!\nGumshoe:\nMmph!\nPhoenix:\n(Detective Gumshoe doesn't look so good...)\nKarma:\nContinue! Now!Gumshoe:\nBut... the next morning, a body was found in the lake.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid you find any clues on the body?\nGumshoe:\nA single bullet was recovered from the body. He was shot through the heart... fatally.\nKarma:\nJudge! Here's the bullet... It didn't strike bone, so its shape is well preserved.\nJudge:\nVery well. The court accepts this bullet into evidence.\nPistol Bullet added to the Court Record.Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid you find any clues on the body?\nGumshoe:\nA single bullet was recovered from the body. He was shot through the heart... fatally.Gumshoe:\nSo we had to arrest Mr. Edgeworth.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nW-why is that?\nGumshoe:\nWell, we found the murder weapon in the boat.\nPhoenix:\nThe murder weapon...?\nGumshoe:\nA pistol.\nJudge:\nDetective Gumshoe... That is a vital piece of information. Please revise your testimony.\nGumshoe:\nRight! S-sorry, Your Honor.\nChanges statement from \"So we had to arrest Mr. Edgeworth.\" to \"The murder weapon we found in the boat was decisive evidence.\"Gumshoe:\nThe murder weapon we found in the boat was decisive evidence.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat about the pistol made it \"decisive evidence\"?\nKarma:\nTsk tsk tsk...\nPhoenix:\n(Ack! He has the same evil laugh as Edgeworth...)\nGumshoe:\nThere were fingerprints on the pistol found in the boat. They were clear prints from Mr. Edgeworth's right hand.\nPhoenix:\nWh-what!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! So Mr. Edgeworth's fingerprints were found on the murder weapon!?\nGumshoe:\nY-yes, Your Honor.\nKarma:\nJudge! This is the weapon in question.\nJudge:\nA-accepted into evidence.\nPistol added to the Court Record.Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat about the pistol made it \"decisive evidence\"?\nKarma:\nTsk tsk tsk...\nPhoenix:\n(Ack! He has the same evil laugh as Edgeworth...)\nGumshoe:\nThere were fingerprints on the pistol found in the boat. They were clear prints from Mr. Edgeworth's right hand.\nPhoenix:\nWh-what!?Maya:\nNick. Doesn't it seem like Detective Gumshoe is being a little vague?Phoenix:\nI bet von Karma is feeding him lines! His testimony's probably filled with landmines just waiting for me to press.Maya:\nWhat do we do?Phoenix:\nGrit our teeth and press, I guess. What else can we do?Maya:\nWell said, Nick! You're the man!After pressing fifth statement and pressing modified sixth statement:Karma:\nMembers of the court... We now have the pistol used in the murder, and the bullet found in the body! Detective!Gumshoe:\nY-y-yessir!Karma:\nWas the bullet found in the body fired from this pistol?Gumshoe:\nYes. The ballistic markings on the bullet match the pistol.Judge:\nHmm...Maya:\nHey, Nick! What does he mean, \"ballistic markings\"?Karma:\nShocking! To imagine someone here does not know something as basic as ballistic markings!Maya:\nN-Nick! He's glaring at me!Karma:\nTsk... very well, I'll explain. Actually, Judge! You do it.Judge:\nEh? M-me? ... Erm, ahem. Ballistic markings are like the \"fingerprints\" of a gun. The barrel leaves distinctive marks on each bullet it fires. You can examine these \"ballistic fingerprints\" to see which gun fired the shot. It's quite accurate.Karma:\nIndeed. This leads to one, inevitable conclusion: the bullet found in the victim's heart... was, without a doubt, fired from this pistol. This pistol which, as you may recall, was covered with the defendant's own fingerprints!Judge:\nO-order! Order!Phoenix:\n(This is bad... This makes it look like Edgeworth did it!)Karma:\nWell, Judge?Judge:\nI'd say it's almost decisive, yes. Honestly, I could declare a verdict at this point. However...Karma:\nYou wish to hear the witness speak, no doubt. Very well. I am somewhat fatigued, and so I will take a brief break. I will call my witness after the recess. Which will last ten minutes. Judge!Judge:\nY-yes?Karma:\nWhat are you doing? A ten minute recess! Now!Judge:\nB-but, wait, I...Karma:\nJust bang your flimsy gavel and get on with it, man!Judge:\nY-yes! Ahem. This court will take a ten minute recess.Phoenix:\n(Who's running this court, anyway!?)December 26, 11:09 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2Phoenix:\nEdgeworth! What's going on here!? Your fingerprints were on the murder weapon!Edgeworth:\nUh... hmm...Phoenix:\nAnd that foggy photo makes one thing clear... The only one who could have shot that man was the person in the photo!Edgeworth:\nTrue...Phoenix:\nWas that you in the boat?Edgeworth:\n... Yes. It was me.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Edgeworth:\nBut... you must believe me. I didn't shoot him.Phoenix:\nTh-then who did!?Edgeworth:\nI... don't know.Phoenix:\nYou don't know!? Weren't you right there!?Edgeworth:\n... I heard a gunshot from very close by. Then... the other man fell from the boat. I can't say why, but... I thought, at the time, that he had shot himself!Phoenix:\nY-you mean it was a suicide!?Edgeworth:\n... That's the only explanation I can come up with.Phoenix:\nHuh... (How am I going to convince anyone of that!?) Say, Maya?Maya:\nHuh? Wh-what?Phoenix:\nAny progress with Mia?Maya:\nOh... Sorry. It's no good.Phoenix:\nUgh...Maya:\nI know... I'm no good for anything, am I, Nick? If I can't call my sister, I might as well not be here, right?No, I need you here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nNo, of course not, I need you here! I can see you're always trying to help out. Even if you don't actually help... it's the thought that counts, right?\nMaya:\nIt's okay Nick, you don't have to make me feel better.\nLeads to:\n\"I don't know anything about trials, or defense...\"Yeah, you're useless\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm, well, actually... (You don't know law, you don't have any trial experience or techniques... Yeah, you're pretty much useless... but I can't say that!)\nMaya:\nIt's okay Nick. You don't have to say anything. Your face said it for you.\nPhoenix:\n(Whoops!) N-no, o-of course we... I'm sorry.\nMaya:\nIt's okay Nick.\nLeads to:\n\"I don't know anything about trials, or defense...\"Maya:\nI don't know anything about trials, or defense... What's more, I'm a spirit medium who can't even contact spirits...Phoenix:\nAww, everyone has their off days! I mean, I've just been getting lucky lately... But you never know when my luck is going to run out!Maya:\nReally...?Edgeworth:\nW-w-whoa! Wright! Don't jinx this case any worse than it already is! It's bad for my heart...Phoenix:\nOh? Oh! S-sorry... (Whoops!)Judge:\nCourt is back in session. Mr. von Karma, call your witness.Karma:\nYes. Will Ms. Lotta Hart take the stand?Karma:\nLotta Hart, you are a research student at a university?Lotta:\nThat I am.Karma:\nGood. Begin by telling us what you saw the night of the incident. And don't add anything trivial or subjective. Understand?Lotta:\n... Y'all need to learn some manners.Karma:\nUNDERSTAND?Lotta:\nY-yeah, I understand, I understand!Judge:\nEr... very well. Your testimony, please.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Lotta:\nIt was Christmas Eve, just after midnight, I reckon.\nI was in my car.\nI heard this \"bang\" come up from the lake.\nWhen I looked out the window, I saw two gents in a boat.\nThen there was another \"bang\"...\nThere wasn't nary a thing on the lake but that boat.Karma:\nEnough.Lotta:\nHuh?Karma:\nJudge! She happened to take a photo of the incident! This is that photo. Accept it as evidence.Judge:\nW-well! This is a surprise! This looks like... the very moment of the murder! O-Order! I will remove you from the court if I do not have order immediately!Karma:\nAs the witness testified, she looked at the lake when she heard the shot. There were no other boats on that lake! So, the man in the boat with the victim must have been the one who shot him... Yes. It was the defendant, Miles Edgeworth!!!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order...! I will have order!Karma:\n... Well, Judge?Judge:\nThe evidence is... decisive. I have very little doubt about this case. Very well, this court finds the defendant...Phoenix:Phoenix:\nW-wait! Your Honor! I haven't cross-examined the witness yet!Karma:\nA cross-examination? We have photographic proof! What question can there possibly be!? This photo is worth a thousand words... and they all read \"guilty\"! You lose. Or... Do you claim to have found a contradiction in her testimony!?Phoenix:\n...!Karma:\nVery well. If you have to, you may cross-examine the witness. You will only flounder and ask meaningless questions! You will fail to find anything! And then, I will have you held in contempt of court!Maya:\nUh, Nick... contempt...?Phoenix:\n\"Contempt of court,\" you know?Maya:\nI... guess I understand. Well... what are you going to do? Do you really think there was a contradiction with the facts in her testimony?I think there was\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI... think I noticed one little thing...\nMaya:\nWow, I'm impressed, Nick! I didn't notice anything! Right! Let's take him on!\nPhoenix:\nY-yeah... (I got a bad feeling about this...)\nLeads to:\n\"I understand... I will cross-examine the witness!\"I think there wasn't\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHonestly, I found nothing.\nMaya:\nI dunno, I thought her testimony was strange. She was so vague about everything!\nPhoenix:\nI bet von Karma probably fed her her lines.\nMaya:\nBut... But if you don't cross-examine her, the judge will...\nPhoenix:\nHe'll bang down that \"flimsy gavel\" of his and declare Edgeworth guilty.\nMaya:\nI guess we'll just have to bluff it.\nPhoenix:\nBut if we mess up... contempt of court.\nMaya:\nHey, if we lose we'll be held in public contempt!\nPhoenix:\nEr... right.\nLeads to:\n\"I understand... I will cross-examine the witness!\"Phoenix:\nI understand... I will cross-examine the witness!Karma:\nTsk tsk tsk... Very well!Judge:\nI pray for your sake this isn't a waste of time.Cross Examination-- Witness's Account --Lotta:\nIt was Christmas Eve, just after midnight, I reckon.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Just after midnight,\" you say? In other words, it was no longer Christmas Eve... but Christmas Day!\nLotta:\nHuh? Uh, yeah, well, yes.\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nI know you want to find contradictions, but really!\nPhoenix:\nMmmph.\nJudge:\nI hope your next contradiction is a little more relevant to the trial.Lotta:\nI was in my car.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy were you camping there, anyway?\nLotta:\nI'm a research student at my university. I was taking pictures to use in my research.\nPhoenix:\n(What research? This all sounds suspicious...)\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMs. Hart.

I've had enough of baseless claims made without a hair of evidence to support them!\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWell all right, if that's how you want to play... I'll show you evidence!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Are you sure about this?\nPhoenix:\n(I'm sure sick of that smarmy prosecutor putting me down! Or... did he taunt me so I'd get mad and make a mistake?)\nLeads to:\n\"Very well, let's see it.\"I have proof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI have it! Proof!\nJudge:\nHmm... Intriguing!\nLeads to:\n\"Very well, let's see it.\"Judge:\nVery well, let's see it. And... no joking around this time, please. Here is proof that the witness was trying to photograph Gourdy, the lake monster!Present Lotta's Camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe proof, Ms. Hart, is your own camera!\nLotta:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nYou camera was set to take photos in response to loud noises, correct? Thus this photograph here, taken when a gun fired on the lake.\nLotta:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAnd here, this article about \"Gourdy.\" According to this article... Gourdy made a loud noise when it emerged! Well? You were trying to photograph Gourdy, weren't you! That's why you had set your camera to respond to loud noises!\nLeads to:\n\"Order! Order!\"Present Gourdy Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe proof is this article about Gourdy the lake monster!\nLotta:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nAccording to this article... When Gourdy breaks through the water, it makes a loud noise! Which is why you set up your camera with that microphone! You had it set to respond to loud noises! And that's how you got this picture when the pistol fired!\nLeads to:\n\"Order! Order!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHere's my proof! It's simple!\nJudge:\n... If it's simple... then why have you obviously made an error, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nUrk...?\nLotta:\nWhat's that!?\nKarma:\nGo home. Consider a career change.\nPhoenix:\n(Gah! How can they so casually toss aside this eviden... Oh. Whoops. Wrong evidence.)\nJudge:\nLuckily for you, I'm in a patient mood, Mr. Wright. One more time please.\nLeads back to:\n\"Here is proof that the witness was trying to photograph Gourdy, the lake monster!\"Judge:\nOrder! Order! I see... I, too, thought it was a little strange.Phoenix:\n(Yeah, sure!) Well, Ms. Hart? You were camping there to try and take a photo of Gourdy, weren't you?Lotta:\n... Yeah. Not bad. Are all you lawyers that smart? So, smart boy, I was down there trying to photograph Gourdy, you got me. So what?Phoenix:\nHuh...?Lotta:\nThat don't change what I saw, does it?Karma:\nExactly! What you just used several precious minutes of our time to prove... is nothing more than that the witness is an idiot who thinks monsters exist!Lotta:\nH-hey!Karma:\nBut, as she so succinctly said, so what!? It changes nothing!Phoenix:\n(Not true! You were hiding the whole thing about Gourdy for some reason, I know it! But what could it have been...? Whatever it is, I'm getting to the bottom of this!)Judge:\nMs. Hart. Why did you hide the fact that you were searching for Gourdy from the court? Please revise your testimony.Lotta:\n... Right. Fine, I'll testify. It won't change nothing, though.Phoenix:\n(Something will change... it has to! And I'm going to spot it!)Karma:\n...Witness Testimony-- Lotta's New Testimony --Lotta:\nActually, I'm not a research student at a university.\nI'm an investigative photographer.\nImagine what a scoop it'd be if I got a picture of that monster!\nThat's why I was camping out by the lake.\nBut, that's all I was hiding.\nWhen I heard the \"bang\" I looked right straight out at that lake.\nThere wasn't much else to look at, so I just watched that boat the whole time.\nThen I saw a flash, near one of the men's hands, and I heard another gunshot.\nI was looking right at that boat, the whole time, cross my heart and hope to fry.Judge:\nHmm... Well, Mr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.Karma:Karma:\nThe witness's testimony is unchanged from before! Whether she is a research student or a photographer has no bearing on this case! There is no need to waste more of our time with another pointless cross-examination!Judge:\nEr... hmm.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nI claim the defense's right to cross-examine the witness, Your Honor! (von Karma's up to something, I know it! He doesn't want me to cross-examine her because... why? Was there a contradiction?)Judge:\nVery well. You may begin the cross-examination. You seem sure of yourself, you must have something in mind.Karma:\nHah! That would be a first!Phoenix:\n(Hah hah, very funny.)Judge:\nYou understand that this is your last chance at a cross-examination, Mr. Wright? If there is no problem with the testimony this time, we will let the witness leave. I will announce my verdict at that time, Mr. Wright. Understood?Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.Cross Examination",

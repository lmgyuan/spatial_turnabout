Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution will show the court that at 2:30 PM on October 15, the defendant, Mr. Will Powers, killed fellow actor Jack Hammer at Studio One of Global Studios. It is impossible for anyone else to have committed this heinous crime. The evidence presented during the trial will all point to this fact.Judge:\nHmm. I see. Very well, I would like to move on to your testimony. Mr. Edgeworth, the prosecution may call its first witness.Edgeworth:\nVery well, I call a most familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand. (Changed from [First, I would like to call a familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand.] in the original release)Edgeworth:\nDetective, if you would briefly describe this case to the court?Gumshoe:\nYes sir! I'll explain with the guidemap here. To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see? This here is the Employee Area. The actors did a run-through of their action scenes during the morning here. This is the main gate to the studios. The security lady that works at the studios was here at 1:00 PM on that day. Past the security station there is a gate, see? Past that are the studios. And here it is... Studio One. This is the scene of the murder, where the body was found! Now, on the day of the murder, October 15, there were only three people here. The victim, Jack Hammer, the defendant, Will Powers, and a young woman, the production assistant. All the production staff were in the Employee Area until noon. Then after lunch, the victim, Jack Hammer, went to Studio One. Right after that, at 1:00 PM, the security lady got to the guard station. Now, jump ahead to later that day... 5:00 PM. The production staff came to Studio One to perform a rehearsal. Needless to say, the rehearsal was cancelled... The time of death was 2:30 PM. The \"Samurai Spear\" found lodged in the victim's chest was the murder weapon. That's the case, in brief. Anyone like to hear that again?Phoenix:\n(Hmm... should I listen to that whole thing again...?)Skip it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"I think I can probably remember that...\"Listen again\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry, could you describe that one more time?\nGumshoe:\nI shoulda known it would be you, pal! Fine. Once more for the mentally-challenged lawyer.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, yeah. Live it up while you can, Gumshoe.)\nLeads back to:\n\"To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see?\"Phoenix:\n(I think I can probably remember that...)Judge:\nSo the murder weapon was a \"spear\"? How... medieval!Samurai Spear added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:\nYour Honor. This case is quite simple if you ask one question: And that question is: \"What did the security lady at the guard station see?\"Judge:\nUnderstood.Edgeworth:\nLet's call this security officer to the stand!Edgeworth:\nWill the witness declare her name?Oldbag:\n... Hmm? My, aren't you a handsome fellow! I'm afraid I'm a bit flustered!Edgeworth:\nY-your name, please!Oldbag:\nOh, dearie! No need for you to be embarrassed! Just call me \"grandma.\"Edgeworth:\nYOUR NAME, PLEASE!Phoenix:\n(Seems Edgeworth has a bit of trouble getting his witnesses to say their names...)Oldbag:\nWendy Oldbag, dearie. So just call me \"grandma.\" It's practically my name! So even when I was young I was an Oldbag, but not really that was just my name dearie. Still how the other children would make fun of me and just because of my name can you believe it? But there was this boy, the captain of the chess club in junior high, and when he called me an old bag well I just cried and cried because I had a crush on him you see--Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nO-objection! I... object to the witness's talkativeness.Judge:\nObjection sustained! The witness will refrain from rambling on the stand.Oldbag:\nI was just getting to the good part, dearie!Edgeworth:\nPerhaps we can get to the testimony?Judge:\nNow, the witness was stationed at the main gate on the day of the murder, correct?Oldbag:\nYessey I was.Judge:\nAnd to get to the scene of the murder, someone would have to pass by you?Oldbag:\nYou know your stuff, dearie!Judge:\n... You may begin your testimony.Phoenix:\n(She sure is one hell of an Oldbag...)Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Oldbag:\nOn the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.\nPoor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.\nI, well, I had some errands to run that morning.\nAnyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.\nI was at the main gate from then until 5:00!\nNow, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?\nInteresting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.\nIt was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!Judge:\nYou saw the defendant, then? Hmm... Very well. Let's begin the cross-examination. Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.Cross Examination-- Witness's Account --Oldbag:\nOn the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo up until that time, anyone who wanted to could go into the studio?\nOldbag:\nWell, there wasn't a security guard at the gate, no. But the main gate was locked, dearie. You'd need an employee cardkey to get in.\nPhoenix:\n(Right... the cardkey that I have. So, what she's saying is no one who wasn't supposed to be there could get in.)\nEdgeworth:\nWas there anyone at the studios when you arrived at the guard station?Oldbag:\nPoor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nA \"run-through\"...?\nOldbag:\nThey were working out a scene between the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate. They got the basics figured out by noon, and were to use the afternoon for practice. Rehearsal was supposed to start at 5:00. That's why poor old Hammer went to Studio One in the afternoon.\nPhoenix:\n(So Powers was in his dressing room sleeping... when he was supposed to be practicing! Talk about a laid-back hero...)\nEdgeworth:\nIf there was a run-through in the morning, why did you only get there after noon?Oldbag:\nI, well, I had some errands to run that morning.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of \"errands\"?\nOldbag:\nOh, well, you know.\nPhoenix:\nAnswer the question!\nOldbag:\nActually... I was watching poor Hammer and Powers. Observing, you know?\nPhoenix:\nO-observing? Weren't you supposed to be at the guard station?\nOldbag:\nWhippersnapper! I told you I locked the gate, didn't I? I did my job!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not sure your boss would see it that way...)\nOldbag:\nAnyway! I always watch Hammer's run-throughts. Always! Never missed one in all my years.\nMaya:\nWow! I want to see a Steel Samurai run-through too!\nPhoenix:\nYou could quit being a spirit medium and take up guard duty.\nMaya:\nNot a bad idea...Oldbag:\nAnyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid you see the victim then?\nOldbag:\nDid I see poor old Hammer? Nope. He'd already gone to the studio before I got back to the guard station.\nEdgeworth:\nTell us what happened next.Oldbag:\nI was at the main gate from then until 5:00!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you were watching there the WHOLE time? No breaks? Not even a second?\nOldbag:\nO-of course! I am a professional, you know! Our are you criticizing how I do my job!? Whippersnapper!\nPhoenix:\nNo, it's just, after seeing you eating those donuts in the guard station yesterday...\nOldbag:\nI can watch the gate and eat donuts at the same time! Snipperwhapper!\nMaya:\n\"Snipperwhapper\"...? Old windbag is losing it, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWhy don't you raise an objection?\nJudge:\nSo, the witness was on duty through the afternoon, the whole time. Very well. What did you see?Oldbag:\nNow, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow did you know that?\nOldbag:\nOh hoh hoh. I have my ways! That over-dressed young detective told me. I fed him some donuts and he talked and talked... If you ask me, that detective isn't cut out for his job.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Detective Gumshoe, getting chewed out by a security guard...)Oldbag:\nInteresting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n2:00? You're sure?\nOldbag:\nSure as spit!\nJudge:\nWell, who was the man!?\nOldbag:\nReally, you should try not to get so excited at your age. You might strain something.\nJudge:\n...\nOldbag:\nNow, now, don't get your skivvies all in a bunch. I'll tell you who it was!Present Powers's(?) Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag!\"Oldbag:\nIt was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you saw Mr. Powers?\nOldbag:\nThat's what I said! Got wax in your ears, sonny?\nMaya:\nNick, this is your chance!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, time to pull out the secret weapon...\nOldbag:\nI'll say it again! It was him!Present Powers's(?) Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag!\"Maya:\nNick... Doesn't she seem like she's enjoying this a little too much?Phoenix:\nWindbags love gossiping about other people's misfortunes.Maya:\nUgh. Can't she get her kicks somewhere else?",

I did my job!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not sure your boss would see it that way...)\nOldbag:\nAnyway! I always watch Hammer's run-throughts. Always! Never missed one in all my years.\nMaya:\nWow! I want to see a Steel Samurai run-through too!\nPhoenix:\nYou could quit being a spirit medium and take up guard duty.\nMaya:\nNot a bad idea...Oldbag:\nAnyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid you see the victim then?\nOldbag:\nDid I see poor old Hammer? Nope. He'd already gone to the studio before I got back to the guard station.\nEdgeworth:\nTell us what happened next.Oldbag:\nI was at the main gate from then until 5:00!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you were watching there the WHOLE time? No breaks? Not even a second?\nOldbag:\nO-of course! I am a professional, you know! Our are you criticizing how I do my job!? Whippersnapper!\nPhoenix:\nNo, it's just, after seeing you eating those donuts in the guard station yesterday...\nOldbag:\nI can watch the gate and eat donuts at the same time! Snipperwhapper!\nMaya:\n\"Snipperwhapper\"...? Old windbag is losing it, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWhy don't you raise an objection?\nJudge:\nSo, the witness was on duty through the afternoon, the whole time. Very well. What did you see?Oldbag:\nNow, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow did you know that?\nOldbag:\nOh hoh hoh. I have my ways! That over-dressed young detective told me. I fed him some donuts and he talked and talked... If you ask me, that detective isn't cut out for his job.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Detective Gumshoe, getting chewed out by a security guard...)Oldbag:\nInteresting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n2:00? You're sure?\nOldbag:\nSure as spit!\nJudge:\nWell, who was the man!?\nOldbag:\nReally, you should try not to get so excited at your age. You might strain something.\nJudge:\n...\nOldbag:\nNow, now, don't get your skivvies all in a bunch. I'll tell you who it was!Present Powers's(?) Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag!\"Oldbag:\nIt was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you saw Mr. Powers?\nOldbag:\nThat's what I said! Got wax in your ears, sonny?\nMaya:\nNick, this is your chance!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, time to pull out the secret weapon...\nOldbag:\nI'll say it again! It was him!Present Powers's(?) Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag!\"Maya:\nNick... Doesn't she seem like she's enjoying this a little too much?Phoenix:\nWindbags love gossiping about other people's misfortunes.Maya:\nUgh. Can't she get her kicks somewhere else?Phoenix:\nLet me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag! You've been saying since yesterday that you \"saw Mr. Powers,\" correct? But you're talking about the man in this photo, aren't you!Judge:\nJ-just a moment, Mr. Wright. Let me see that photo! ... What is this, exactly?Phoenix:\nNone other than the Steel Samurai, defender of Neo Olde Tokyo. Ms. Oldbag! Is this the \"Mr. Powers\" that you saw!?Oldbag:\nOf course! Didn't your momma teach you any sense, sonny? Anyone can plainly see that's Powers! Right?Edgeworth:\nNo, they can't! (Changed from [Um, yeah.] in the original release) ... Umm... well. I mean, I wonder? (Changed from [Umm... well. I wonder?] in the original release)Phoenix:\nTrue, Mr. Powers does play the role of the Steel Samurai! But that doesn't mean Mr. Powers IS the Steel Samurai!Oldbag:\n...! I... I know that! I wasn't born yesterday!Judge:\nNo one in this court is accusing you of that, Ms... er, witness.Phoenix:\n(He's having trouble calling her \"Oldbag\" apparently...)Judge:\nHowever, you do not have proof that the person in this photo is Mr. Will Powers, do you?Oldbag:\nHumph! Nosy old man! Of course I have proof!Phoenix:\nWhat!?Edgeworth:\nHuh!?Phoenix:\n(Even Edgeworth is surprised!?)Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution would like to ask the old... the witness. Please make known all the information in your possession ahead of time!Oldbag:\nHow was I to know everyone would be so nosy! You should be ashamed, all of you! Anyway, I showed that photo to the young detective. He told me \"this isn't any good as evidence, pal.\" He didn't even give it a second look!Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\n(Wow, old windbag has left even Edgeworth speechless. She's good!)Judge:\nLet's hear about your proof, then.Witness Testimony-- The Man in the Photo --Oldbag:\nI never say anything I don't mean, mind you!\nThat morning, during the run-through of the action scene...\nI saw Powers trip and fall!\nHe broke one of the props, it was a big mess.\nApparently, he sprained his ankle pretty bad.\nNow, look at that picture!\nYou can see he's dragging his leg! See? Clear as day!\nThat's how I knew it was Powers. Happy?Judge:\nHmm. So he had sprained his ankle...? Very well. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Phoenix:\n(She's got to be hiding something... I'll press her until she squeals.)Cross Examination-- The Man in the Photo --Oldbag:\nI never say anything I don't mean, mind you!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nOldbag:\nWhippersnapper!\nPhoenix:\n(Hey, I haven't said anything yet!)\nOldbag:\nI'll have you know I'm not pointing fingers at anyone behind their backs! Everything I've said is on the straight and narrow! The up and up! Youth today! Always whining about each other, pointing fingers this way and that! It's enough to make an old lady want to cry...\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Wright! Please, for all our sakes, try not to upset the witness!\nPhoenix:\n(I think Edgeworth has met his match...)Oldbag:\nThat morning, during the run-through of the action scene...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWho was present at the run-through?\nOldbag:\nWell, let's see... There was Powers, he's the Steel Samurai... Then poor old Hammer, the Evil Magistrate. And... me.\nJudge:\nAnd what exactly were you doing?\nOldbag:\nObserving! Just... observing.\nPhoenix:\nWhat about the assistant?\nOldbag:\nOh, she was off moving backdrops around and such.\nPhoenix:\n(So she didn't see the run-through, then...)Oldbag:\nI saw Powers trip and fall!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Trip and fall\"...?\nOldbag:\nYes! And to think, he's supposed to be the Steel Samurai! What a laugh! So Powers sprained his ankle. I helped make it better for him, of course.\nJudge:\nYou... helped make it better?\nOldbag:\nI kissed it where it hurt.\nJudge:\nL-let's just skip over that part, shall we?\nPhoenix:\nWhere was the assistant then?\nOldbag:\nOh, her? She was cleaning up backdrops, I think. She didn't know about Powers's ankle.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm...)\nEdgeworth:\nYou may continue your testimony.Oldbag:\nHe broke one of the props, it was a big mess.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe broke a prop?\nOldbag:\nSure did! His own Samurai Spear.\nPhoenix:\n(His Samurai Spear... the murder weapon!?)\nOldbag:\nLuckily I was there with my duct tape to fix it.\nPhoenix:\n(This strikes me as a significant detail... I'd better write this down in the Court Record.)\nSamurai Spear updated in the Court Record.Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe broke a prop?\nOldbag:\nSure did! His own Samurai Spear.\nPhoenix:\n(His Samurai Spear... the murder weapon!?)\nOldbag:\nLuckily I was there with my duct tape to fix it.\nPhoenix:\n(This strikes me as a significant detail...)Oldbag:\nApparently, he sprained his ankle pretty bad.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWas Mr. Power's [sic] ankle badly sprained?\nOldbag:\nNot so bad that he couldn't walk around. He went to his dressing room to rest up after lunch.\nPhoenix:\n(Thus the nap...)\nOldbag:\nAnyway, I saw him dragging his foot when he walked.\nPhoenix:\n(Dragging his foot... okay.)Oldbag:\nYou can see he's dragging his leg! See? Clear as day!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely sure? (Let's take a look at that picture again... Hmm... so he was walking strangely because he was injured...)\nJudge:\nHmm. It does look like he was dragging his foot.\nOldbag:\nSee! And you didn't trust me! Whippersnapper!Oldbag:\nThat's how I knew it was Powers. Happy?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nStill, you can't look at this and say it's Mr. Powers!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYes, but only Mr. Powers would have been dragging his leg!\nJudge:\nHe has a point. It does seem quite likely that it was Powers.\nPhoenix:\n(There's got to be more to this. I'd better keep pressing her.)Maya:\nWell, Nick? Find any glaring contradictions?Phoenix:\nWell, she seems pretty sure that was Powers in that photo... I guess I'll just press her and see if I can shake her conviction...",

Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution will show the court that at 2:30 PM on October 15, the defendant, Mr. Will Powers, killed fellow actor Jack Hammer at Studio One of Global Studios. It is impossible for anyone else to have committed this heinous crime. The evidence presented during the trial will all point to this fact.Judge:\nHmm. I see. Very well, I would like to move on to your testimony. Mr. Edgeworth, the prosecution may call its first witness.Edgeworth:\nVery well, I call a most familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand. (Changed from [First, I would like to call a familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand.] in the original release)Edgeworth:\nDetective, if you would briefly describe this case to the court?Gumshoe:\nYes sir! I'll explain with the guidemap here. To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see? This here is the Employee Area. The actors did a run-through of their action scenes during the morning here. This is the main gate to the studios. The security lady that works at the studios was here at 1:00 PM on that day. Past the security station there is a gate, see? Past that are the studios. And here it is... Studio One. This is the scene of the murder, where the body was found! Now, on the day of the murder, October 15, there were only three people here. The victim, Jack Hammer, the defendant, Will Powers, and a young woman, the production assistant. All the production staff were in the Employee Area until noon. Then after lunch, the victim, Jack Hammer, went to Studio One. Right after that, at 1:00 PM, the security lady got to the guard station. Now, jump ahead to later that day... 5:00 PM. The production staff came to Studio One to perform a rehearsal. Needless to say, the rehearsal was cancelled... The time of death was 2:30 PM. The \"Samurai Spear\" found lodged in the victim's chest was the murder weapon. That's the case, in brief. Anyone like to hear that again?Phoenix:\n(Hmm... should I listen to that whole thing again...?)Skip it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"I think I can probably remember that...\"Listen again\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry, could you describe that one more time?\nGumshoe:\nI shoulda known it would be you, pal! Fine. Once more for the mentally-challenged lawyer.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, yeah. Live it up while you can, Gumshoe.)\nLeads back to:\n\"To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see?\"Phoenix:\n(I think I can probably remember that...)Judge:\nSo the murder weapon was a \"spear\"? How... medieval!Samurai Spear added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:\nYour Honor. This case is quite simple if you ask one question: And that question is: \"What did the security lady at the guard station see?\"Judge:\nUnderstood.Edgeworth:\nLet's call this security officer to the stand!Edgeworth:\nWill the witness declare her name?Oldbag:\n... Hmm? My, aren't you a handsome fellow! I'm afraid I'm a bit flustered!Edgeworth:\nY-your name, please!Oldbag:\nOh, dearie! No need for you to be embarrassed! Just call me \"grandma.\"Edgeworth:\nYOUR NAME, PLEASE!Phoenix:\n(Seems Edgeworth has a bit of trouble getting his witnesses to say their names...)Oldbag:\nWendy Oldbag, dearie. So just call me \"grandma.\" It's practically my name! So even when I was young I was an Oldbag, but not really that was just my name dearie. Still how the other children would make fun of me and just because of my name can you believe it? But there was this boy, the captain of the chess club in junior high, and when he called me an old bag well I just cried and cried because I had a crush on him you see--Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nO-objection! I... object to the witness's talkativeness.Judge:\nObjection sustained! The witness will refrain from rambling on the stand.Oldbag:\nI was just getting to the good part, dearie!Edgeworth:\nPerhaps we can get to the testimony?Judge:\nNow, the witness was stationed at the main gate on the day of the murder, correct?Oldbag:\nYessey I was.Judge:\nAnd to get to the scene of the murder, someone would have to pass by you?Oldbag:\nYou know your stuff, dearie!Judge:\n... You may begin your testimony.Phoenix:\n(She sure is one hell of an Oldbag...)Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Oldbag:\nOn the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.\nPoor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.\nI, well, I had some errands to run that morning.\nAnyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.\nI was at the main gate from then until 5:00!\nNow, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?\nInteresting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.\nIt was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!Judge:\nYou saw the defendant, then? Hmm... Very well. Let's begin the cross-examination. Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.Cross Examination-- Witness's Account --Oldbag:\nOn the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo up until that time, anyone who wanted to could go into the studio?\nOldbag:\nWell, there wasn't a security guard at the gate, no. But the main gate was locked, dearie. You'd need an employee cardkey to get in.\nPhoenix:\n(Right... the cardkey that I have. So, what she's saying is no one who wasn't supposed to be there could get in.)\nEdgeworth:\nWas there anyone at the studios when you arrived at the guard station?Oldbag:\nPoor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nA \"run-through\"...?\nOldbag:\nThey were working out a scene between the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate. They got the basics figured out by noon, and were to use the afternoon for practice. Rehearsal was supposed to start at 5:00. That's why poor old Hammer went to Studio One in the afternoon.\nPhoenix:\n(So Powers was in his dressing room sleeping... when he was supposed to be practicing! Talk about a laid-back hero...)\nEdgeworth:\nIf there was a run-through in the morning, why did you only get there after noon?Oldbag:\nI, well, I had some errands to run that morning.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of \"errands\"?\nOldbag:\nOh, well, you know.\nPhoenix:\nAnswer the question!\nOldbag:\nActually... I was watching poor Hammer and Powers. Observing, you know?\nPhoenix:\nO-observing? Weren't you supposed to be at the guard station?\nOldbag:\nWhippersnapper! I told you I locked the gate, didn't I? I did my job!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not sure your boss would see it that way...)\nOldbag:\nAnyway! I always watch Hammer's run-throughts. Always! Never missed one in all my years.\nMaya:\nWow! I want to see a Steel Samurai run-through too!\nPhoenix:\nYou could quit being a spirit medium and take up guard duty.\nMaya:\nNot a bad idea...Oldbag:\nAnyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid you see the victim then?\nOldbag:\nDid I see poor old Hammer? Nope. He'd already gone to the studio before I got back to the guard station.\nEdgeworth:\nTell us what happened next.Oldbag:\nI was at the main gate from then until 5:00!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you were watching there the WHOLE time? No breaks? Not even a second?\nOldbag:\nO-of course! I am a professional, you know! Our are you criticizing how I do my job!? Whippersnapper!\nPhoenix:\nNo, it's just, after seeing you eating those donuts in the guard station yesterday...\nOldbag:\nI can watch the gate and eat donuts at the same time! Snipperwhapper!\nMaya:\n\"Snipperwhapper\"...? Old windbag is losing it, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWhy don't you raise an objection?\nJudge:\nSo, the witness was on duty through the afternoon, the whole time. Very well. What did you see?Oldbag:\nNow, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow did you know that?\nOldbag:\nOh hoh hoh. I have my ways! That over-dressed young detective told me. I fed him some donuts and he talked and talked... If you ask me, that detective isn't cut out for his job.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Detective Gumshoe, getting chewed out by a security guard...)Oldbag:\nInteresting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n2:00? You're sure?\nOldbag:\nSure as spit!\nJudge:\nWell, who was the man!?\nOldbag:\nReally, you should try not to get so excited at your age. You might strain something.\nJudge:\n...\nOldbag:\nNow, now, don't get your skivvies all in a bunch. I'll tell you who it was!Present Powers's(?) Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag!\"Oldbag:\nIt was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you saw Mr. Powers?\nOldbag:\nThat's what I said! Got wax in your ears, sonny?\nMaya:\nNick, this is your chance!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, time to pull out the secret weapon...\nOldbag:\nI'll say it again! It was him!Present Powers's(?) Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag!\"Maya:\nNick... Doesn't she seem like she's enjoying this a little too much?Phoenix:\nWindbags love gossiping about other people's misfortunes.Maya:\nUgh. Can't she get her kicks somewhere else?Phoenix:\nLet me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag! You've been saying since yesterday that you \"saw Mr. Powers,\" correct? But you're talking about the man in this photo, aren't you!Judge:\nJ-just a moment, Mr. Wright. Let me see that photo! ... What is this, exactly?Phoenix:\nNone other than the Steel Samurai, defender of Neo Olde Tokyo. Ms. Oldbag! Is this the \"Mr. Powers\" that you saw!?Oldbag:\nOf course! Didn't your momma teach you any sense, sonny? Anyone can plainly see that's Powers! Right?Edgeworth:\nNo, they can't! (Changed from [Um, yeah.] in the original release) ... Umm... well. I mean, I wonder? (Changed from [Umm... well. I wonder?] in the original release)Phoenix:\nTrue, Mr. Powers does play the role of the Steel Samurai! But that doesn't mean Mr. Powers IS the Steel Samurai!Oldbag:\n...! I... I know that! I wasn't born yesterday!Judge:\nNo one in this court is accusing you of that, Ms... er, witness.Phoenix:\n(He's having trouble calling her \"Oldbag\" apparently...)Judge:\nHowever, you do not have proof that the person in this photo is Mr. Will Powers, do you?Oldbag:\nHumph! Nosy old man! Of course I have proof!Phoenix:\nWhat!?Edgeworth:\nHuh!?Phoenix:\n(Even Edgeworth is surprised!?)Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution would like to ask the old... the witness. Please make known all the information in your possession ahead of time!Oldbag:\nHow was I to know everyone would be so nosy! You should be ashamed, all of you! Anyway, I showed that photo to the young detective. He told me \"this isn't any good as evidence, pal.\" He didn't even give it a second look!Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\n(Wow, old windbag has left even Edgeworth speechless. She's good!)Judge:\nLet's hear about your proof, then.Witness Testimony-- The Man in the Photo --Oldbag:\nI never say anything I don't mean, mind you!\nThat morning, during the run-through of the action scene...\nI saw Powers trip and fall!\nHe broke one of the props, it was a big mess.\nApparently, he sprained his ankle pretty bad.\nNow, look at that picture!\nYou can see he's dragging his leg! See? Clear as day!\nThat's how I knew it was Powers. Happy?Judge:\nHmm. So he had sprained his ankle...? Very well. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Phoenix:\n(She's got to be hiding something... I'll press her until she squeals.)Cross Examination-- The Man in the Photo --Oldbag:\nI never say anything I don't mean, mind you!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nOldbag:\nWhippersnapper!\nPhoenix:\n(Hey, I haven't said anything yet!)\nOldbag:\nI'll have you know I'm not pointing fingers at anyone behind their backs! Everything I've said is on the straight and narrow! The up and up! Youth today! Always whining about each other, pointing fingers this way and that! It's enough to make an old lady want to cry...\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Wright! Please, for all our sakes, try not to upset the witness!\nPhoenix:\n(I think Edgeworth has met his match...)Oldbag:\nThat morning, during the run-through of the action scene...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWho was present at the run-through?\nOldbag:\nWell, let's see... There was Powers, he's the Steel Samurai... Then poor old Hammer, the Evil Magistrate. And... me.\nJudge:\nAnd what exactly were you doing?\nOldbag:\nObserving! Just... observing.\nPhoenix:\nWhat about the assistant?\nOldbag:\nOh, she was off moving backdrops around and such.\nPhoenix:\n(So she didn't see the run-through, then...)Oldbag:\nI saw Powers trip and fall!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Trip and fall\"...?\nOldbag:\nYes! And to think, he's supposed to be the Steel Samurai! What a laugh! So Powers sprained his ankle. I helped make it better for him, of course.\nJudge:\nYou... helped make it better?\nOldbag:\nI kissed it where it hurt.\nJudge:\nL-let's just skip over that part, shall we?\nPhoenix:\nWhere was the assistant then?\nOldbag:\nOh, her? She was cleaning up backdrops, I think. She didn't know about Powers's ankle.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm...)\nEdgeworth:\nYou may continue your testimony.Oldbag:\nHe broke one of the props, it was a big mess.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe broke a prop?\nOldbag:\nSure did! His own Samurai Spear.\nPhoenix:\n(His Samurai Spear... the murder weapon!?)\nOldbag:\nLuckily I was there with my duct tape to fix it.\nPhoenix:\n(This strikes me as a significant detail... I'd better write this down in the Court Record.)\nSamurai Spear updated in the Court Record.Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe broke a prop?\nOldbag:\nSure did! His own Samurai Spear.\nPhoenix:\n(His Samurai Spear... the murder weapon!?)\nOldbag:\nLuckily I was there with my duct tape to fix it.\nPhoenix:\n(This strikes me as a significant detail...)Oldbag:\nApparently, he sprained his ankle pretty bad.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWas Mr. Power's [sic] ankle badly sprained?\nOldbag:\nNot so bad that he couldn't walk around. He went to his dressing room to rest up after lunch.\nPhoenix:\n(Thus the nap...)\nOldbag:\nAnyway, I saw him dragging his foot when he walked.\nPhoenix:\n(Dragging his foot... okay.)Oldbag:\nYou can see he's dragging his leg! See? Clear as day!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely sure? (Let's take a look at that picture again... Hmm... so he was walking strangely because he was injured...)\nJudge:\nHmm. It does look like he was dragging his foot.\nOldbag:\nSee! And you didn't trust me! Whippersnapper!Oldbag:\nThat's how I knew it was Powers. Happy?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nStill, you can't look at this and say it's Mr. Powers!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYes, but only Mr. Powers would have been dragging his leg!\nJudge:\nHe has a point. It does seem quite likely that it was Powers.\nPhoenix:\n(There's got to be more to this. I'd better keep pressing her.)Maya:\nWell, Nick? Find any glaring contradictions?Phoenix:\nWell, she seems pretty sure that was Powers in that photo... I guess I'll just press her and see if I can shake her conviction...After pressing second or third statement, then pressing fourth statement:Edgeworth:\nI think we've heard enough! Haven't we, Your Honor?Judge:\nWell, there is one thing that bothers me.Edgeworth:\nWhich is?Judge:\nWhere is this \"Steel Samurai\" costume now?Edgeworth:\nUmm... hmm. Actually, well... We couldn't find it. We're looking, though.Judge:\nHmm...Edgeworth:\nAnyway, that's not important! The witness did see the Steel Samurai, yes. And it is clear that the person in the Steel Samurai suit was Mr. Will Powers!Judge:\nHmm... I suppose that's right.Phoenix:\n(Are you sure you're sure, Your Honor?)Object\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHold it right there! We keep talking possibilities, but we have to agree that this photo shows the Steel Samurai! Nowhere in this photo can we see Mr. Will Powers!\nJudge:\nHmm... The defense has a point. I also wonder if someone else not caught on camera could have killed Mr. Hammer. We have to consider that possibility, also.\nEdgeworth:\nThen allow me to remove that doubt from your mind, Your Honor...\nLeads to:\n\"Will the witness continue her testimony, please?\"Wait and see what happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I think I'll wait and see where this goes.)\nJudge:\nI suppose, since there weren't any additional crew members at the studios that day... It's quite likely that it was the defendant inside that costume. I see no problem with this evidence.\nEdgeworth:\nMost perceptive, Your Honor!\nPhoenix:\n(He still doesn't seem that convinced to me... I hope.)\nLeads to:\n\"Will the witness continue her testimony, please?\"Edgeworth:\nWill the witness continue her testimony, please?Oldbag:\nNo need to ask twice!Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account, cont. --Oldbag:\nThe time of poor Hammer's death was 2:30 PM, true?\nThe only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers!\nNo one else went there!\nIf they had, I would have seen them!Judge:\nHmm... So, if no one else went to the studio... Then it would have to be this \"Steel Samurai\" who did it. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Cross Examination-- Witness's Account, cont. --Oldbag:\nThe time of poor Hammer's death was 2:30 PM, true?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow do you know that?\nOldbag:\nEh? Didn't I just explain? I gave donuts to the young detective. And the, after some rubbish about it being a \"secret, pal\" he told me everything.\nPhoenix:\n(I see Detective Gumshoe shares his fellow officer's fondness for donuts.)Oldbag:\nThe only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely sure!?\nOldbag:\nOh, quite, quite, sonny. Nobody suspicious lookin' passed by at all.\nPhoenix:\n(Nobody suspicious lookin'... Right.)Present Powers's(?)

Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution will show the court that at 2:30 PM on October 15, the defendant, Mr. Will Powers, killed fellow actor Jack Hammer at Studio One of Global Studios. It is impossible for anyone else to have committed this heinous crime. The evidence presented during the trial will all point to this fact.Judge:\nHmm. I see. Very well, I would like to move on to your testimony. Mr. Edgeworth, the prosecution may call its first witness.Edgeworth:\nVery well, I call a most familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand. (Changed from [First, I would like to call a familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand.] in the original release)Edgeworth:\nDetective, if you would briefly describe this case to the court?Gumshoe:\nYes sir! I'll explain with the guidemap here. To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see? This here is the Employee Area. The actors did a run-through of their action scenes during the morning here. This is the main gate to the studios. The security lady that works at the studios was here at 1:00 PM on that day. Past the security station there is a gate, see? Past that are the studios. And here it is... Studio One. This is the scene of the murder, where the body was found! Now, on the day of the murder, October 15, there were only three people here. The victim, Jack Hammer, the defendant, Will Powers, and a young woman, the production assistant. All the production staff were in the Employee Area until noon. Then after lunch, the victim, Jack Hammer, went to Studio One. Right after that, at 1:00 PM, the security lady got to the guard station. Now, jump ahead to later that day... 5:00 PM. The production staff came to Studio One to perform a rehearsal. Needless to say, the rehearsal was cancelled... The time of death was 2:30 PM. The \"Samurai Spear\" found lodged in the victim's chest was the murder weapon. That's the case, in brief. Anyone like to hear that again?Phoenix:\n(Hmm... should I listen to that whole thing again...?)Skip it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"I think I can probably remember that...\"Listen again\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry, could you describe that one more time?\nGumshoe:\nI shoulda known it would be you, pal! Fine. Once more for the mentally-challenged lawyer.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, yeah. Live it up while you can, Gumshoe.)\nLeads back to:\n\"To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see?\"Phoenix:\n(I think I can probably remember that...)Judge:\nSo the murder weapon was a \"spear\"? How... medieval!Samurai Spear added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:\nYour Honor. This case is quite simple if you ask one question: And that question is: \"What did the security lady at the guard station see?\"Judge:\nUnderstood.Edgeworth:\nLet's call this security officer to the stand!Edgeworth:\nWill the witness declare her name?Oldbag:\n... Hmm? My, aren't you a handsome fellow! I'm afraid I'm a bit flustered!Edgeworth:\nY-your name, please!Oldbag:\nOh, dearie! No need for you to be embarrassed! Just call me \"grandma.\"Edgeworth:\nYOUR NAME, PLEASE!Phoenix:\n(Seems Edgeworth has a bit of trouble getting his witnesses to say their names...)Oldbag:\nWendy Oldbag, dearie. So just call me \"grandma.\" It's practically my name! So even when I was young I was an Oldbag, but not really that was just my name dearie. Still how the other children would make fun of me and just because of my name can you believe it? But there was this boy, the captain of the chess club in junior high, and when he called me an old bag well I just cried and cried because I had a crush on him you see--Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nO-objection! I... object to the witness's talkativeness.Judge:\nObjection sustained! The witness will refrain from rambling on the stand.Oldbag:\nI was just getting to the good part, dearie!Edgeworth:\nPerhaps we can get to the testimony?Judge:\nNow, the witness was stationed at the main gate on the day of the murder, correct?Oldbag:\nYessey I was.Judge:\nAnd to get to the scene of the murder, someone would have to pass by you?Oldbag:\nYou know your stuff, dearie!Judge:\n... You may begin your testimony.Phoenix:\n(She sure is one hell of an Oldbag...)Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Oldbag:\nOn the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.\nPoor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.\nI, well, I had some errands to run that morning.\nAnyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.\nI was at the main gate from then until 5:00!\nNow, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?\nInteresting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.\nIt was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!Judge:\nYou saw the defendant, then? Hmm... Very well. Let's begin the cross-examination. Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.Cross Examination-- Witness's Account --Oldbag:\nOn the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo up until that time, anyone who wanted to could go into the studio?\nOldbag:\nWell, there wasn't a security guard at the gate, no. But the main gate was locked, dearie. You'd need an employee cardkey to get in.\nPhoenix:\n(Right... the cardkey that I have. So, what she's saying is no one who wasn't supposed to be there could get in.)\nEdgeworth:\nWas there anyone at the studios when you arrived at the guard station?Oldbag:\nPoor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nA \"run-through\"...?\nOldbag:\nThey were working out a scene between the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate. They got the basics figured out by noon, and were to use the afternoon for practice. Rehearsal was supposed to start at 5:00. That's why poor old Hammer went to Studio One in the afternoon.\nPhoenix:\n(So Powers was in his dressing room sleeping... when he was supposed to be practicing! Talk about a laid-back hero...)\nEdgeworth:\nIf there was a run-through in the morning, why did you only get there after noon?Oldbag:\nI, well, I had some errands to run that morning.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of \"errands\"?\nOldbag:\nOh, well, you know.\nPhoenix:\nAnswer the question!\nOldbag:\nActually... I was watching poor Hammer and Powers. Observing, you know?\nPhoenix:\nO-observing? Weren't you supposed to be at the guard station?\nOldbag:\nWhippersnapper! I told you I locked the gate, didn't I? I did my job!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not sure your boss would see it that way...)\nOldbag:\nAnyway! I always watch Hammer's run-throughts. Always! Never missed one in all my years.\nMaya:\nWow! I want to see a Steel Samurai run-through too!\nPhoenix:\nYou could quit being a spirit medium and take up guard duty.\nMaya:\nNot a bad idea...Oldbag:\nAnyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid you see the victim then?\nOldbag:\nDid I see poor old Hammer? Nope. He'd already gone to the studio before I got back to the guard station.\nEdgeworth:\nTell us what happened next.Oldbag:\nI was at the main gate from then until 5:00!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you were watching there the WHOLE time? No breaks? Not even a second?\nOldbag:\nO-of course! I am a professional, you know! Our are you criticizing how I do my job!? Whippersnapper!\nPhoenix:\nNo, it's just, after seeing you eating those donuts in the guard station yesterday...\nOldbag:\nI can watch the gate and eat donuts at the same time! Snipperwhapper!\nMaya:\n\"Snipperwhapper\"...? Old windbag is losing it, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWhy don't you raise an objection?\nJudge:\nSo, the witness was on duty through the afternoon, the whole time. Very well. What did you see?Oldbag:\nNow, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow did you know that?\nOldbag:\nOh hoh hoh. I have my ways! That over-dressed young detective told me. I fed him some donuts and he talked and talked... If you ask me, that detective isn't cut out for his job.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Detective Gumshoe, getting chewed out by a security guard...)Oldbag:\nInteresting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n2:00? You're sure?\nOldbag:\nSure as spit!\nJudge:\nWell, who was the man!?\nOldbag:\nReally, you should try not to get so excited at your age. You might strain something.\nJudge:\n...\nOldbag:\nNow, now, don't get your skivvies all in a bunch. I'll tell you who it was!Present Powers's(?) Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag!\"Oldbag:\nIt was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you saw Mr. Powers?\nOldbag:\nThat's what I said! Got wax in your ears, sonny?\nMaya:\nNick, this is your chance!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, time to pull out the secret weapon...\nOldbag:\nI'll say it again! It was him!Present Powers's(?) Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag!\"Maya:\nNick... Doesn't she seem like she's enjoying this a little too much?Phoenix:\nWindbags love gossiping about other people's misfortunes.Maya:\nUgh. Can't she get her kicks somewhere else?Phoenix:\nLet me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag! You've been saying since yesterday that you \"saw Mr. Powers,\" correct? But you're talking about the man in this photo, aren't you!Judge:\nJ-just a moment, Mr. Wright. Let me see that photo! ... What is this, exactly?Phoenix:\nNone other than the Steel Samurai, defender of Neo Olde Tokyo. Ms. Oldbag! Is this the \"Mr. Powers\" that you saw!?Oldbag:\nOf course! Didn't your momma teach you any sense, sonny? Anyone can plainly see that's Powers! Right?Edgeworth:\nNo, they can't! (Changed from [Um, yeah.] in the original release) ... Umm... well. I mean, I wonder? (Changed from [Umm... well. I wonder?] in the original release)Phoenix:\nTrue, Mr. Powers does play the role of the Steel Samurai! But that doesn't mean Mr. Powers IS the Steel Samurai!Oldbag:\n...! I... I know that! I wasn't born yesterday!Judge:\nNo one in this court is accusing you of that, Ms... er, witness.Phoenix:\n(He's having trouble calling her \"Oldbag\" apparently...)Judge:\nHowever, you do not have proof that the person in this photo is Mr. Will Powers, do you?Oldbag:\nHumph! Nosy old man! Of course I have proof!Phoenix:\nWhat!?Edgeworth:\nHuh!?Phoenix:\n(Even Edgeworth is surprised!?)Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution would like to ask the old... the witness. Please make known all the information in your possession ahead of time!Oldbag:\nHow was I to know everyone would be so nosy! You should be ashamed, all of you! Anyway, I showed that photo to the young detective. He told me \"this isn't any good as evidence, pal.\" He didn't even give it a second look!Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\n(Wow, old windbag has left even Edgeworth speechless. She's good!)Judge:\nLet's hear about your proof, then.Witness Testimony-- The Man in the Photo --Oldbag:\nI never say anything I don't mean, mind you!\nThat morning, during the run-through of the action scene...\nI saw Powers trip and fall!\nHe broke one of the props, it was a big mess.\nApparently, he sprained his ankle pretty bad.\nNow, look at that picture!\nYou can see he's dragging his leg! See? Clear as day!\nThat's how I knew it was Powers. Happy?Judge:\nHmm. So he had sprained his ankle...? Very well. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Phoenix:\n(She's got to be hiding something... I'll press her until she squeals.)Cross Examination-- The Man in the Photo --Oldbag:\nI never say anything I don't mean, mind you!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nOldbag:\nWhippersnapper!\nPhoenix:\n(Hey, I haven't said anything yet!)\nOldbag:\nI'll have you know I'm not pointing fingers at anyone behind their backs! Everything I've said is on the straight and narrow! The up and up! Youth today! Always whining about each other, pointing fingers this way and that! It's enough to make an old lady want to cry...\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Wright! Please, for all our sakes, try not to upset the witness!\nPhoenix:\n(I think Edgeworth has met his match...)Oldbag:\nThat morning, during the run-through of the action scene...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWho was present at the run-through?\nOldbag:\nWell, let's see... There was Powers, he's the Steel Samurai... Then poor old Hammer, the Evil Magistrate. And... me.\nJudge:\nAnd what exactly were you doing?\nOldbag:\nObserving! Just... observing.\nPhoenix:\nWhat about the assistant?\nOldbag:\nOh, she was off moving backdrops around and such.\nPhoenix:\n(So she didn't see the run-through, then...)Oldbag:\nI saw Powers trip and fall!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Trip and fall\"...?\nOldbag:\nYes! And to think, he's supposed to be the Steel Samurai! What a laugh! So Powers sprained his ankle. I helped make it better for him, of course.\nJudge:\nYou... helped make it better?\nOldbag:\nI kissed it where it hurt.\nJudge:\nL-let's just skip over that part, shall we?\nPhoenix:\nWhere was the assistant then?\nOldbag:\nOh, her? She was cleaning up backdrops, I think. She didn't know about Powers's ankle.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm...)\nEdgeworth:\nYou may continue your testimony.Oldbag:\nHe broke one of the props, it was a big mess.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe broke a prop?\nOldbag:\nSure did! His own Samurai Spear.\nPhoenix:\n(His Samurai Spear... the murder weapon!?)\nOldbag:\nLuckily I was there with my duct tape to fix it.\nPhoenix:\n(This strikes me as a significant detail... I'd better write this down in the Court Record.)\nSamurai Spear updated in the Court Record.Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe broke a prop?\nOldbag:\nSure did! His own Samurai Spear.\nPhoenix:\n(His Samurai Spear... the murder weapon!?)\nOldbag:\nLuckily I was there with my duct tape to fix it.\nPhoenix:\n(This strikes me as a significant detail...)Oldbag:\nApparently, he sprained his ankle pretty bad.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWas Mr. Power's [sic] ankle badly sprained?\nOldbag:\nNot so bad that he couldn't walk around. He went to his dressing room to rest up after lunch.\nPhoenix:\n(Thus the nap...)\nOldbag:\nAnyway, I saw him dragging his foot when he walked.\nPhoenix:\n(Dragging his foot... okay.)Oldbag:\nYou can see he's dragging his leg! See? Clear as day!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely sure? (Let's take a look at that picture again... Hmm... so he was walking strangely because he was injured...)\nJudge:\nHmm. It does look like he was dragging his foot.\nOldbag:\nSee! And you didn't trust me! Whippersnapper!Oldbag:\nThat's how I knew it was Powers. Happy?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nStill, you can't look at this and say it's Mr. Powers!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYes, but only Mr. Powers would have been dragging his leg!\nJudge:\nHe has a point. It does seem quite likely that it was Powers.\nPhoenix:\n(There's got to be more to this. I'd better keep pressing her.)Maya:\nWell, Nick? Find any glaring contradictions?Phoenix:\nWell, she seems pretty sure that was Powers in that photo... I guess I'll just press her and see if I can shake her conviction...After pressing second or third statement, then pressing fourth statement:Edgeworth:\nI think we've heard enough! Haven't we, Your Honor?Judge:\nWell, there is one thing that bothers me.Edgeworth:\nWhich is?Judge:\nWhere is this \"Steel Samurai\" costume now?Edgeworth:\nUmm... hmm. Actually, well... We couldn't find it. We're looking, though.Judge:\nHmm...Edgeworth:\nAnyway, that's not important! The witness did see the Steel Samurai, yes. And it is clear that the person in the Steel Samurai suit was Mr. Will Powers!Judge:\nHmm... I suppose that's right.Phoenix:\n(Are you sure you're sure, Your Honor?)Object\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHold it right there! We keep talking possibilities, but we have to agree that this photo shows the Steel Samurai! Nowhere in this photo can we see Mr. Will Powers!\nJudge:\nHmm... The defense has a point. I also wonder if someone else not caught on camera could have killed Mr. Hammer. We have to consider that possibility, also.\nEdgeworth:\nThen allow me to remove that doubt from your mind, Your Honor...\nLeads to:\n\"Will the witness continue her testimony, please?\"Wait and see what happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I think I'll wait and see where this goes.)\nJudge:\nI suppose, since there weren't any additional crew members at the studios that day... It's quite likely that it was the defendant inside that costume. I see no problem with this evidence.\nEdgeworth:\nMost perceptive, Your Honor!\nPhoenix:\n(He still doesn't seem that convinced to me... I hope.)\nLeads to:\n\"Will the witness continue her testimony, please?\"Edgeworth:\nWill the witness continue her testimony, please?Oldbag:\nNo need to ask twice!Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account, cont. --Oldbag:\nThe time of poor Hammer's death was 2:30 PM, true?\nThe only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers!\nNo one else went there!\nIf they had, I would have seen them!Judge:\nHmm... So, if no one else went to the studio... Then it would have to be this \"Steel Samurai\" who did it. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Cross Examination-- Witness's Account, cont. --Oldbag:\nThe time of poor Hammer's death was 2:30 PM, true?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow do you know that?\nOldbag:\nEh? Didn't I just explain? I gave donuts to the young detective. And the, after some rubbish about it being a \"secret, pal\" he told me everything.\nPhoenix:\n(I see Detective Gumshoe shares his fellow officer's fondness for donuts.)Oldbag:\nThe only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely sure!?\nOldbag:\nOh, quite, quite, sonny. Nobody suspicious lookin' passed by at all.\nPhoenix:\n(Nobody suspicious lookin'... Right.)Present Powers's(?)

Why, everyone was in the Employee Area before then. And I locked the main gate so no one could get in. Not to mention...Present Powers's(?) Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Hold on!\"Oldbag:\nIf they had, I would have seen them!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure!?\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe witness has answered the question! Anyone going into the studio had to pass by the witness!\nOldbag:\nThat's right, sonny! You let 'em have it, Edgey-boy!\nPhoenix:\n(E-Edgey-boy...?)\nEdgeworth:\n...Present Powers's(?) Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Hold on!\"Maya:\nOld windbag sure has balls! Or... well, you know what I mean.Phoenix:\nOld windbags have a way of skipping over important details, after all... Or, for that matter, entirely forgetting them.Maya:\nHow convenient.Phoenix:\n(Something for you to look forward to, perhaps?)Phoenix:\nHold on! Look at this photograph one more time. This photo was taken by the camera at the gate for the studios, correct?Oldbag:\nYesiree, sonny.Phoenix:\nSo, whenever anyone passes by here, it automatically takes a picture?Oldbag:\nAnd here I thought you didn't know your head from a hole in the ground.Phoenix:\nRight... Anyway! It's also true that the computer in the guard station records all security cam data.Oldbag:\nOoh! You know, if you wanted to work at the studio, we might have an opening.Phoenix:\nThat very computer printed out this photo. Note that on the back of the photo are printed the words: [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2]Oldbag:\nEven I know that means it was taken at 2:00 PM on October the 15th! Really, sonny!Phoenix:\nActually, I knew that too. The issure here is the bit at the end where it says: \"Photo #2\"...Oldbag:\n\"Photo #2\"...?Phoenix:\nThe computer only held data for one photo on that day. Don't you think that's odd? Shouldn't this photo be \"Photo #1\" if it really was the ONLY photo!?Judge:\nOrder! Order! Please tell the court what you mean by this, Mr. Wright!Phoenix:\nActually, that's what I want to ask the witness. This evidence shows that not one, but two people went to the studio that day. Yet there is only data for one of the photos! Who could have erased the data for the other photo? Only someone with access-- the security lady herself! (Changed from [Only someone with access... the security lady herself!] in the original release)Oldbag:\nEh!? You watch your mouth, whippersnapper! The only person I saw that day was Will Powers!Phoenix:\nBut the camera on the gate fired twice! That means two people went by!Oldbag:\nUmm... well, yes... that's what it would seem to mean...Judge:\nCan the witness explain this to the court?Oldbag:\nUmm... ahem. I-I don't understand these new-fangled computer things... Umm... E-Edgey-boy! Help!Edgeworth:\nHuh!? B-believe me, I want to, but I don't know what this means either.Oldbag:\nHumph! Some help you are! You're a whippersnapper too! ... ... Whippersnapper...?Judge:\nSomething the matter, Ms. Oldbag?Oldbag:\nAh! That's right! I... I just remembered something!Judge:\nLet me guess... Someone else passed by the gate... someone other than the Steel Samurai?Oldbag:\nEr... well, yes, I suppose you could put it that way.Judge:\n*sigh* I see. Your testimony, please.Witness Testimony-- The Other Person --Oldbag:\nEvery day, after I finish my guard duties, I have one other important job to do.\nI go through the photos recorded on the security computer and check them.\nI throw out any photos that aren't suspicious lookin', you see.\nCome to think of it, now I remember throwing out one photo that day!Edgeworth:\nM-Ms. Oldbag! This is the first I've heard of this!Oldbag:\nWell, of course, sonny! I've only just remembered it.Judge:\nRight... anyway, Mr. Wright, please begin the cross-examination.Maya:\nWell, I'd say this was a turn for the unexpected, but I kind of expected this...Cross Examination-- The Other Person --Oldbag:\nEvery day, after I finish my guard duties, I have one other important job to do.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnother \"job\"?\nOldbag:\nT-that's right. I check all the people that passed by the main gate that day. I look closely at every one of the photos that security camera takes.\nEdgeworth:\nDo you backup all of the security camera data?\nOldbag:\nWell, they keep telling me too, yes. But those computers are just so frustrating.Oldbag:\nI go through the photos recorded on the security computer and check them.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow many photos are there, usually?\nOldbag:\nOn a day when we're open to the public, we get more than 500 people. But on filming days or rehearsal days... well, we don't have much money. We never get more than 50, and that's a big day.\nEdgeworth:\nDo you backup all of the security camera data?\nOldbag:\nWell, they keep telling me too, yes. But those computers are just so frustrating.Oldbag:\nI throw out any photos that aren't suspicious lookin', you see.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow exactly do you determine what isn't \"suspicious lookin'\"?\nOldbag:\nOh, you can tell by looking at their faces. For the most part.\nPhoenix:\nF-for the most part? This is a murder trial, Ms. Oldbag!\nOldbag:\nWell, I didn't touch that suspicious lookin' Will Powers's photo, did I?\nPhoenix:\n(I think she's missing the point.)Oldbag:\nCome to think of it, now I remember throwing out one photo that day!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Well, who in the heck was in that photo you erased!?\"Maya:\n\"Come to think of it\"? Couldn't she think of that a little earlier!?Phoenix:\nClassic old windbag maneuver, Maya.Maya:\nHmm...

Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution will show the court that at 2:30 PM on October 15, the defendant, Mr. Will Powers, killed fellow actor Jack Hammer at Studio One of Global Studios. It is impossible for anyone else to have committed this heinous crime. The evidence presented during the trial will all point to this fact.Judge:\nHmm. I see. Very well, I would like to move on to your testimony. Mr. Edgeworth, the prosecution may call its first witness.Edgeworth:\nVery well, I call a most familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand. (Changed from [First, I would like to call a familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand.] in the original release)Edgeworth:\nDetective, if you would briefly describe this case to the court?Gumshoe:\nYes sir! I'll explain with the guidemap here. To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see? This here is the Employee Area. The actors did a run-through of their action scenes during the morning here. This is the main gate to the studios. The security lady that works at the studios was here at 1:00 PM on that day. Past the security station there is a gate, see? Past that are the studios. And here it is... Studio One. This is the scene of the murder, where the body was found! Now, on the day of the murder, October 15, there were only three people here. The victim, Jack Hammer, the defendant, Will Powers, and a young woman, the production assistant. All the production staff were in the Employee Area until noon. Then after lunch, the victim, Jack Hammer, went to Studio One. Right after that, at 1:00 PM, the security lady got to the guard station. Now, jump ahead to later that day... 5:00 PM. The production staff came to Studio One to perform a rehearsal. Needless to say, the rehearsal was cancelled... The time of death was 2:30 PM. The \"Samurai Spear\" found lodged in the victim's chest was the murder weapon. That's the case, in brief. Anyone like to hear that again?Phoenix:\n(Hmm... should I listen to that whole thing again...?)Skip it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"I think I can probably remember that...\"Listen again\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry, could you describe that one more time?\nGumshoe:\nI shoulda known it would be you, pal! Fine. Once more for the mentally-challenged lawyer.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, yeah. Live it up while you can, Gumshoe.)\nLeads back to:\n\"To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see?\"Phoenix:\n(I think I can probably remember that...)Judge:\nSo the murder weapon was a \"spear\"? How... medieval!Samurai Spear added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:\nYour Honor. This case is quite simple if you ask one question: And that question is: \"What did the security lady at the guard station see?\"Judge:\nUnderstood.Edgeworth:\nLet's call this security officer to the stand!Edgeworth:\nWill the witness declare her name?Oldbag:\n... Hmm? My, aren't you a handsome fellow! I'm afraid I'm a bit flustered!Edgeworth:\nY-your name, please!Oldbag:\nOh, dearie! No need for you to be embarrassed! Just call me \"grandma.\"Edgeworth:\nYOUR NAME, PLEASE!Phoenix:\n(Seems Edgeworth has a bit of trouble getting his witnesses to say their names...)Oldbag:\nWendy Oldbag, dearie. So just call me \"grandma.\" It's practically my name! So even when I was young I was an Oldbag, but not really that was just my name dearie. Still how the other children would make fun of me and just because of my name can you believe it? But there was this boy, the captain of the chess club in junior high, and when he called me an old bag well I just cried and cried because I had a crush on him you see--Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nO-objection! I... object to the witness's talkativeness.Judge:\nObjection sustained! The witness will refrain from rambling on the stand.Oldbag:\nI was just getting to the good part, dearie!Edgeworth:\nPerhaps we can get to the testimony?Judge:\nNow, the witness was stationed at the main gate on the day of the murder, correct?Oldbag:\nYessey I was.Judge:\nAnd to get to the scene of the murder, someone would have to pass by you?Oldbag:\nYou know your stuff, dearie!Judge:\n... You may begin your testimony.Phoenix:\n(She sure is one hell of an Oldbag...)Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Oldbag:\nOn the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.\nPoor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.\nI, well, I had some errands to run that morning.\nAnyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.\nI was at the main gate from then until 5:00!\nNow, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?\nInteresting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.\nIt was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!Judge:\nYou saw the defendant, then? Hmm... Very well. Let's begin the cross-examination. Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.Cross Examination-- Witness's Account --Oldbag:\nOn the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo up until that time, anyone who wanted to could go into the studio?\nOldbag:\nWell, there wasn't a security guard at the gate, no. But the main gate was locked, dearie. You'd need an employee cardkey to get in.\nPhoenix:\n(Right... the cardkey that I have. So, what she's saying is no one who wasn't supposed to be there could get in.)\nEdgeworth:\nWas there anyone at the studios when you arrived at the guard station?Oldbag:\nPoor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nA \"run-through\"...?\nOldbag:\nThey were working out a scene between the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate. They got the basics figured out by noon, and were to use the afternoon for practice. Rehearsal was supposed to start at 5:00. That's why poor old Hammer went to Studio One in the afternoon.\nPhoenix:\n(So Powers was in his dressing room sleeping... when he was supposed to be practicing! Talk about a laid-back hero...)\nEdgeworth:\nIf there was a run-through in the morning, why did you only get there after noon?Oldbag:\nI, well, I had some errands to run that morning.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of \"errands\"?\nOldbag:\nOh, well, you know.\nPhoenix:\nAnswer the question!\nOldbag:\nActually... I was watching poor Hammer and Powers. Observing, you know?\nPhoenix:\nO-observing? Weren't you supposed to be at the guard station?\nOldbag:\nWhippersnapper! I told you I locked the gate, didn't I? I did my job!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not sure your boss would see it that way...)\nOldbag:\nAnyway! I always watch Hammer's run-throughts. Always! Never missed one in all my years.\nMaya:\nWow! I want to see a Steel Samurai run-through too!\nPhoenix:\nYou could quit being a spirit medium and take up guard duty.\nMaya:\nNot a bad idea...Oldbag:\nAnyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid you see the victim then?\nOldbag:\nDid I see poor old Hammer? Nope. He'd already gone to the studio before I got back to the guard station.\nEdgeworth:\nTell us what happened next.Oldbag:\nI was at the main gate from then until 5:00!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you were watching there the WHOLE time? No breaks? Not even a second?\nOldbag:\nO-of course! I am a professional, you know! Our are you criticizing how I do my job!? Whippersnapper!\nPhoenix:\nNo, it's just, after seeing you eating those donuts in the guard station yesterday...\nOldbag:\nI can watch the gate and eat donuts at the same time! Snipperwhapper!\nMaya:\n\"Snipperwhapper\"...? Old windbag is losing it, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWhy don't you raise an objection?\nJudge:\nSo, the witness was on duty through the afternoon, the whole time. Very well. What did you see?Oldbag:\nNow, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow did you know that?\nOldbag:\nOh hoh hoh. I have my ways! That over-dressed young detective told me. I fed him some donuts and he talked and talked... If you ask me, that detective isn't cut out for his job.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Detective Gumshoe, getting chewed out by a security guard...)Oldbag:\nInteresting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n2:00? You're sure?\nOldbag:\nSure as spit!\nJudge:\nWell, who was the man!?\nOldbag:\nReally, you should try not to get so excited at your age. You might strain something.\nJudge:\n...\nOldbag:\nNow, now, don't get your skivvies all in a bunch. I'll tell you who it was!Present Powers's(?) Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag!\"Oldbag:\nIt was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you saw Mr. Powers?\nOldbag:\nThat's what I said! Got wax in your ears, sonny?\nMaya:\nNick, this is your chance!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, time to pull out the secret weapon...\nOldbag:\nI'll say it again! It was him!Present Powers's(?) Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag!\"Maya:\nNick... Doesn't she seem like she's enjoying this a little too much?Phoenix:\nWindbags love gossiping about other people's misfortunes.Maya:\nUgh. Can't she get her kicks somewhere else?Phoenix:\nLet me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag! You've been saying since yesterday that you \"saw Mr. Powers,\" correct? But you're talking about the man in this photo, aren't you!Judge:\nJ-just a moment, Mr. Wright. Let me see that photo! ... What is this, exactly?Phoenix:\nNone other than the Steel Samurai, defender of Neo Olde Tokyo. Ms. Oldbag! Is this the \"Mr. Powers\" that you saw!?Oldbag:\nOf course! Didn't your momma teach you any sense, sonny? Anyone can plainly see that's Powers! Right?Edgeworth:\nNo, they can't! (Changed from [Um, yeah.] in the original release) ... Umm... well. I mean, I wonder? (Changed from [Umm... well. I wonder?] in the original release)Phoenix:\nTrue, Mr. Powers does play the role of the Steel Samurai! But that doesn't mean Mr. Powers IS the Steel Samurai!Oldbag:\n...! I... I know that! I wasn't born yesterday!Judge:\nNo one in this court is accusing you of that, Ms... er, witness.Phoenix:\n(He's having trouble calling her \"Oldbag\" apparently...)Judge:\nHowever, you do not have proof that the person in this photo is Mr. Will Powers, do you?Oldbag:\nHumph! Nosy old man! Of course I have proof!Phoenix:\nWhat!?Edgeworth:\nHuh!?Phoenix:\n(Even Edgeworth is surprised!?)Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution would like to ask the old... the witness. Please make known all the information in your possession ahead of time!Oldbag:\nHow was I to know everyone would be so nosy! You should be ashamed, all of you! Anyway, I showed that photo to the young detective. He told me \"this isn't any good as evidence, pal.\" He didn't even give it a second look!Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\n(Wow, old windbag has left even Edgeworth speechless. She's good!)Judge:\nLet's hear about your proof, then.Witness Testimony-- The Man in the Photo --Oldbag:\nI never say anything I don't mean, mind you!\nThat morning, during the run-through of the action scene...\nI saw Powers trip and fall!\nHe broke one of the props, it was a big mess.\nApparently, he sprained his ankle pretty bad.\nNow, look at that picture!\nYou can see he's dragging his leg! See? Clear as day!\nThat's how I knew it was Powers. Happy?Judge:\nHmm. So he had sprained his ankle...? Very well. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Phoenix:\n(She's got to be hiding something... I'll press her until she squeals.)Cross Examination-- The Man in the Photo --Oldbag:\nI never say anything I don't mean, mind you!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nOldbag:\nWhippersnapper!\nPhoenix:\n(Hey, I haven't said anything yet!)\nOldbag:\nI'll have you know I'm not pointing fingers at anyone behind their backs! Everything I've said is on the straight and narrow! The up and up! Youth today! Always whining about each other, pointing fingers this way and that! It's enough to make an old lady want to cry...\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Wright! Please, for all our sakes, try not to upset the witness!\nPhoenix:\n(I think Edgeworth has met his match...)Oldbag:\nThat morning, during the run-through of the action scene...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWho was present at the run-through?\nOldbag:\nWell, let's see... There was Powers, he's the Steel Samurai... Then poor old Hammer, the Evil Magistrate. And... me.\nJudge:\nAnd what exactly were you doing?\nOldbag:\nObserving! Just... observing.\nPhoenix:\nWhat about the assistant?\nOldbag:\nOh, she was off moving backdrops around and such.\nPhoenix:\n(So she didn't see the run-through, then...)Oldbag:\nI saw Powers trip and fall!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Trip and fall\"...?\nOldbag:\nYes! And to think, he's supposed to be the Steel Samurai! What a laugh! So Powers sprained his ankle. I helped make it better for him, of course.\nJudge:\nYou... helped make it better?\nOldbag:\nI kissed it where it hurt.\nJudge:\nL-let's just skip over that part, shall we?\nPhoenix:\nWhere was the assistant then?\nOldbag:\nOh, her? She was cleaning up backdrops, I think. She didn't know about Powers's ankle.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm...)\nEdgeworth:\nYou may continue your testimony.Oldbag:\nHe broke one of the props, it was a big mess.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe broke a prop?\nOldbag:\nSure did! His own Samurai Spear.\nPhoenix:\n(His Samurai Spear... the murder weapon!?)\nOldbag:\nLuckily I was there with my duct tape to fix it.\nPhoenix:\n(This strikes me as a significant detail... I'd better write this down in the Court Record.)\nSamurai Spear updated in the Court Record.Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe broke a prop?\nOldbag:\nSure did! His own Samurai Spear.\nPhoenix:\n(His Samurai Spear... the murder weapon!?)\nOldbag:\nLuckily I was there with my duct tape to fix it.\nPhoenix:\n(This strikes me as a significant detail...)Oldbag:\nApparently, he sprained his ankle pretty bad.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWas Mr. Power's [sic] ankle badly sprained?\nOldbag:\nNot so bad that he couldn't walk around. He went to his dressing room to rest up after lunch.\nPhoenix:\n(Thus the nap...)\nOldbag:\nAnyway, I saw him dragging his foot when he walked.\nPhoenix:\n(Dragging his foot... okay.)Oldbag:\nYou can see he's dragging his leg! See? Clear as day!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely sure? (Let's take a look at that picture again... Hmm... so he was walking strangely because he was injured...)\nJudge:\nHmm. It does look like he was dragging his foot.\nOldbag:\nSee! And you didn't trust me! Whippersnapper!Oldbag:\nThat's how I knew it was Powers. Happy?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nStill, you can't look at this and say it's Mr. Powers!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYes, but only Mr. Powers would have been dragging his leg!\nJudge:\nHe has a point. It does seem quite likely that it was Powers.\nPhoenix:\n(There's got to be more to this. I'd better keep pressing her.)Maya:\nWell, Nick? Find any glaring contradictions?Phoenix:\nWell, she seems pretty sure that was Powers in that photo... I guess I'll just press her and see if I can shake her conviction...After pressing second or third statement, then pressing fourth statement:Edgeworth:\nI think we've heard enough! Haven't we, Your Honor?Judge:\nWell, there is one thing that bothers me.Edgeworth:\nWhich is?Judge:\nWhere is this \"Steel Samurai\" costume now?Edgeworth:\nUmm... hmm. Actually, well... We couldn't find it. We're looking, though.Judge:\nHmm...Edgeworth:\nAnyway, that's not important! The witness did see the Steel Samurai, yes. And it is clear that the person in the Steel Samurai suit was Mr. Will Powers!Judge:\nHmm... I suppose that's right.Phoenix:\n(Are you sure you're sure, Your Honor?)Object\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHold it right there! We keep talking possibilities, but we have to agree that this photo shows the Steel Samurai! Nowhere in this photo can we see Mr. Will Powers!\nJudge:\nHmm... The defense has a point. I also wonder if someone else not caught on camera could have killed Mr. Hammer. We have to consider that possibility, also.\nEdgeworth:\nThen allow me to remove that doubt from your mind, Your Honor...\nLeads to:\n\"Will the witness continue her testimony, please?\"Wait and see what happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I think I'll wait and see where this goes.)\nJudge:\nI suppose, since there weren't any additional crew members at the studios that day... It's quite likely that it was the defendant inside that costume. I see no problem with this evidence.\nEdgeworth:\nMost perceptive, Your Honor!\nPhoenix:\n(He still doesn't seem that convinced to me... I hope.)\nLeads to:\n\"Will the witness continue her testimony, please?\"Edgeworth:\nWill the witness continue her testimony, please?Oldbag:\nNo need to ask twice!Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account, cont. --Oldbag:\nThe time of poor Hammer's death was 2:30 PM, true?\nThe only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers!\nNo one else went there!\nIf they had, I would have seen them!Judge:\nHmm... So, if no one else went to the studio... Then it would have to be this \"Steel Samurai\" who did it. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Cross Examination-- Witness's Account, cont. --Oldbag:\nThe time of poor Hammer's death was 2:30 PM, true?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow do you know that?\nOldbag:\nEh? Didn't I just explain? I gave donuts to the young detective. And the, after some rubbish about it being a \"secret, pal\" he told me everything.\nPhoenix:\n(I see Detective Gumshoe shares his fellow officer's fondness for donuts.)Oldbag:\nThe only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely sure!?\nOldbag:\nOh, quite, quite, sonny. Nobody suspicious lookin' passed by at all.\nPhoenix:\n(Nobody suspicious lookin'... Right.)Present Powers's(?)

Why, everyone was in the Employee Area before then. And I locked the main gate so no one could get in. Not to mention...Present Powers's(?) Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Hold on!\"Oldbag:\nIf they had, I would have seen them!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure!?\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe witness has answered the question! Anyone going into the studio had to pass by the witness!\nOldbag:\nThat's right, sonny! You let 'em have it, Edgey-boy!\nPhoenix:\n(E-Edgey-boy...?)\nEdgeworth:\n...Present Powers's(?) Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Hold on!\"Maya:\nOld windbag sure has balls! Or... well, you know what I mean.Phoenix:\nOld windbags have a way of skipping over important details, after all... Or, for that matter, entirely forgetting them.Maya:\nHow convenient.Phoenix:\n(Something for you to look forward to, perhaps?)Phoenix:\nHold on! Look at this photograph one more time. This photo was taken by the camera at the gate for the studios, correct?Oldbag:\nYesiree, sonny.Phoenix:\nSo, whenever anyone passes by here, it automatically takes a picture?Oldbag:\nAnd here I thought you didn't know your head from a hole in the ground.Phoenix:\nRight... Anyway! It's also true that the computer in the guard station records all security cam data.Oldbag:\nOoh! You know, if you wanted to work at the studio, we might have an opening.Phoenix:\nThat very computer printed out this photo. Note that on the back of the photo are printed the words: [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2]Oldbag:\nEven I know that means it was taken at 2:00 PM on October the 15th! Really, sonny!Phoenix:\nActually, I knew that too. The issure here is the bit at the end where it says: \"Photo #2\"...Oldbag:\n\"Photo #2\"...?Phoenix:\nThe computer only held data for one photo on that day. Don't you think that's odd? Shouldn't this photo be \"Photo #1\" if it really was the ONLY photo!?Judge:\nOrder! Order! Please tell the court what you mean by this, Mr. Wright!Phoenix:\nActually, that's what I want to ask the witness. This evidence shows that not one, but two people went to the studio that day. Yet there is only data for one of the photos! Who could have erased the data for the other photo? Only someone with access-- the security lady herself! (Changed from [Only someone with access... the security lady herself!] in the original release)Oldbag:\nEh!? You watch your mouth, whippersnapper! The only person I saw that day was Will Powers!Phoenix:\nBut the camera on the gate fired twice! That means two people went by!Oldbag:\nUmm... well, yes... that's what it would seem to mean...Judge:\nCan the witness explain this to the court?Oldbag:\nUmm... ahem. I-I don't understand these new-fangled computer things... Umm... E-Edgey-boy! Help!Edgeworth:\nHuh!? B-believe me, I want to, but I don't know what this means either.Oldbag:\nHumph! Some help you are! You're a whippersnapper too! ... ... Whippersnapper...?Judge:\nSomething the matter, Ms. Oldbag?Oldbag:\nAh! That's right! I... I just remembered something!Judge:\nLet me guess... Someone else passed by the gate... someone other than the Steel Samurai?Oldbag:\nEr... well, yes, I suppose you could put it that way.Judge:\n*sigh* I see. Your testimony, please.Witness Testimony-- The Other Person --Oldbag:\nEvery day, after I finish my guard duties, I have one other important job to do.\nI go through the photos recorded on the security computer and check them.\nI throw out any photos that aren't suspicious lookin', you see.\nCome to think of it, now I remember throwing out one photo that day!Edgeworth:\nM-Ms. Oldbag! This is the first I've heard of this!Oldbag:\nWell, of course, sonny!

I look closely at every one of the photos that security camera takes.\nEdgeworth:\nDo you backup all of the security camera data?\nOldbag:\nWell, they keep telling me too, yes. But those computers are just so frustrating.Oldbag:\nI go through the photos recorded on the security computer and check them.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow many photos are there, usually?\nOldbag:\nOn a day when we're open to the public, we get more than 500 people. But on filming days or rehearsal days... well, we don't have much money. We never get more than 50, and that's a big day.\nEdgeworth:\nDo you backup all of the security camera data?\nOldbag:\nWell, they keep telling me too, yes. But those computers are just so frustrating.Oldbag:\nI throw out any photos that aren't suspicious lookin', you see.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow exactly do you determine what isn't \"suspicious lookin'\"?\nOldbag:\nOh, you can tell by looking at their faces. For the most part.\nPhoenix:\nF-for the most part? This is a murder trial, Ms. Oldbag!\nOldbag:\nWell, I didn't touch that suspicious lookin' Will Powers's photo, did I?\nPhoenix:\n(I think she's missing the point.)Oldbag:\nCome to think of it, now I remember throwing out one photo that day!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Well, who in the heck was in that photo you erased!?\"Maya:\n\"Come to think of it\"? Couldn't she think of that a little earlier!?Phoenix:\nClassic old windbag maneuver, Maya.Maya:\nHmm... Might be a useful tactic to remember for use in my future career as a windbag.Phoenix:\n(Let's find out more about this \"erased\" photo.)Phoenix:\nWell, who in the heck was in that photo you erased!?Oldbag:\nHumph. A fanboy.Phoenix:\nF-fanboy?Oldbag:\nSteel Samurai fanboys. Real freaks, if you ask me. They get information about the rehearsals from gosh-knows-where. They're always hanging about. One was there that day.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nW-wait a second! Didn't you just say no one else could get in!? \"I locked the main gate so no one could get in\"... Those were your words!Oldbag:\nWell! If you must know, there's a drain that goes into the Employee Area. The grate has been loose for a while. It leads outside, and well, that's where they come in.Phoenix:\nThey come in through the drain?Oldbag:\nI told you they were freaks. Oh, and...Phoenix:\nAnd...?Oldbag:\nThey're kids. Children. Whippersnappers.Phoenix:\nK-kids!? So, on the photo that you erased...?Oldbag:\nIt was a boy. Probably 2nd or 3rd grade.Phoenix:\nWhaaaaaaaaaaaat!?Judge:\nO-order! Order! Let me get this straight. You saw two people pass by the gate on their way to the studios that day? One was the Steel Samurai, dragging his leg. The other was a boy who looked to be in about 2nd or 3rd grade?Oldbag:\nOh yes, well we see his type there every day. Can't stop 'em. Can't catch 'em.Edgeworth:\nA boy in 2nd or 3rd grade? Hmm... I assume it would be hard, if not impossible for a young boy to wield the Samurai Spear?Judge:\nImpossible, I'd think. It's quite heavy.Oldbag:\nRight! As I said, I didn't pay him much mind. That's why I erased the data.Maya:\nUm, Nick? What's going on? I mean, the boy was there, that makes him a suspect!Phoenix:\nYeah, and they're already trying to \"un-suspect\" him.Judge:\nThis court will take a five-minute recess. (Changed from [I'd like to take a five minute recess.] in the original release) I want the defense and the prosecution to consider this new information... And no forgetting vital information this time!October 18, 11:08 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3Phoenix:\nMr. WP?Will:\nY-yes?Phoenix:\nTell me straight: were you really in your dressing room? You didn't go to the studio?Will:\nI-I didn't go to the studio! I was s-sleeping, honest.Maya:\nSo who was the \"Steel Samurai\" in that security photo?Will:\nHow should I know? The Steel Samurai costume was off in the corner of the dressing room. Anyone could have walked in and taken it, really.Maya:\nWhat!? You should take better care of that stuff!Will:\nI couldn't imagine anyone would want to steal a Steel Samurai costume! So... where does this leave me?Phoenix:\nIt doesn't look good...Will:\n*sniff*Phoenix:\nYou're the only likely suspect, right now.Maya:\nNick! W-what are we going to do!?Phoenix:\nFirst, we play for more time. We'll start targeting someone else that could conceivably have done this!Maya:\nRight! And it'll take them so long to shoot us down that we can get another day!Phoenix:\nRight... but if we pick the wrong person, we might lose on the spot.Will:\nYou... don't sound very optimistic.Phoenix:\nI'm not optimistic at all, actually.Maya:\nHey, Nick. It's time.Phoenix:\nOkay. Let's go. *sigh*Will:\nWhat does that mean... Please don't sigh like that! *sniff*Judge:\nCourt will now reconvene for the trial of Mr. Will Powers. (Changed from [The court will now reconvene for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.] in the original release) Mr. Edgeworth, will you present the prosecution's thoughts on this matter?Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution's thoughts are simple. Nothing has changed. The other person who went to the studios was a boy of roughly 10 years of age. The photo we do have may not be hard evidence... But there is still no one else that could have committed this crime! I call for a verdict of \"guilty\" for the defendant, Mr. Will Powers!Judge:\nHmm... Very well. Mr. Wright, your thoughts?Phoenix:\nThe defense disagrees with the prosecution's claim. There IS another person who could have committed this crime!Judge:\nOrder! Interesting... Let us hear who you have in mind! However... Be aware that this court does not look kindly on accusing the innocent. If you accuse someone who is obviously innocent, you will be penalized.Phoenix:\n(Right. Great. As if the stakes weren't high enough.)Judge:\nSo, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder?The assistant girl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt was the assistant! The Steel Samurai costume was in his dressing room. She stole it, and in doing so she became the Steel Samurai!\nJudge:\nSo you're saying the Steel Samurai in the picture is really the assistant?\nPhoenix:\nThat's correct, Your Honor!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nIf you're serious, you've got guts, Mr. Wright. Remember the photo? Wasn't the Steel Samurai a little lame!? He was dragging his foot!\nPhoenix:\nOh. (Uh oh. Bad feeling time.)\nEdgeworth:\nRemember the testimony concerning Powers's injury!!!\n\n\nOldbag:\nPowers and poor Hammer were at the run-through. Oh, and me.\nPhoenix:\nWhat about the assistant?\nOldbag:\nOh, her? She was cleaning up backdrops, I think. She didn't know about Powers's ankle.\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe assistant knew nothing of Mr. Power's injury! She could look the Steel Samurai look with that costume... But she couldn't walk the the Steel Samurai walk! She wouldn't have limped!\nPhoenix:\nUngh!\nMaya:\nThat kind of takes the legs out from under that case...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. I'm afraid I have to penalize you, as I warned.\nPhoenix:\n(Nobody knows... the trouble I've seen...)\nJudge:\nMay we move on, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(Grr... this fight isn't over yet!) If you would, Your Honor, one more chance, please.\nJudge:\nVery well. Go ahead.\nLeads back to:\n\"So, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder?\"The grade-school boy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt was the grade-school boy! ... ... ... Why isn't anyone saying anything?\nEdgeworth:\nBah! Are you seriously suggesting the boy did it, Mr. Wright!? \"Grade-school boy kills veteran action star with spear!\" For one thing, it was the Steel Samurai holding the murder weapon. Would you care to explain just how the boy was involved?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... maybe that was a dumb move on my part.)\nMaya:\n\"Maybe\"? \"Maybe\"!? How about \"absolutely,\" Nick!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. I'm afraid I have to penalize you, as I warned.\nPhoenix:\n(Nobody knows... the trouble I've seen...)\nJudge:\nMay we move on, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(Grr... this fight isn't over yet!) If you would, Your Honor, one more chance, please.\nJudge:\nVery well. Go ahead.\nLeads back to:\n\"So, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder?\"The security lady\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"It was the security lady! Wendy Oldbag!\"Phoenix:\nIt was the security lady! Wendy Oldbag!Oldbag:\nW-who!?Phoenix:\nThe Steel Samurai is dragging his leg in this picture. That means whoever was in the suit knew about that morning's injury. Maybe because... they had been watching the action scene run-through! There was only one person other than Powers and Hammer who knew about the injury. The security lady, Oldbag!Oldbag:\nW-what!? Whippersnapper!Judge:\nOrder! Order! I-is this true, Oldbag!?Oldbag:\nOldbag!? That's Ms. Oldbag to you!Phoenix:\nMs. Oldbag was standing guard alone at the main gate. She was by herself... in other words, she has no alibi! She could have briefly left her post to steal the the Steel Samurai costume... Then slipped into Studio One, the scene of the murder!Judge:\nW-why would she go through the trouble of wearing the Steel Samurai costume!?Phoenix:\nSimple, Your Honor. She knew the camera at the gate would take her picture. If she was in his costume, she could point the finger at Mr. Powers!Judge:\nI see! Excellent deductive reasoning, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\n(Ohhh yeah, right here! Sherlock Holmes II, baby!) ...? (That's odd. Isn't this the part where Edgeworth pounces...? Doesn't he usually jump up with an objection and some new damning evidence...?)Judge:\nWell, Mr. Edgeworth? Does the prosecution have an opinion on this matter?Edgeworth:\n... The prosecution has no meaningful objections at this time.Oldbag:\nW-w-what!? What's that supposed to mean!? Oh, so you all think I did it? Is that it!? Edgey-boy! Don't just sit there, do something!Phoenix:\n(What's my move? Maybe now's my chance to take this the whole way?)Press further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case...\"Give granny a break\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I guess this does kind of make it look like she's the killer. Funny, I feel bad for her all of a sudden.)\nJudge:\nHmm... It's true that the witness could conceivably have committed this crime. Yet we must not forget that the victim was an action hero. As formidable as her personality may be, I doubt she'd be strong enough.\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh! If he removes her from consideration, that means Mr. Powers is it! Sorry, windbag... but I don't have a choice.)\nLeads to:\n\"The very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case...\"Phoenix:\nThe very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case... can be used to cast doubt on Ms. Oldbag's actions on that day!Oldbag:\nB-but why would I do something so horrible to poor Hammer!?Phoenix:\nYou forget that Mr. Powers lacks a clear motive, too.Judge:\nHmm... Indeed.Phoenix:\n(That did it. Now windbag is one of the suspects. No hard feelings... I hope.)Oldbag:\nWait just a minute! What about the other person who went to the studio!? The boy! The one whose photo I erased!Judge:\nHe's only a grade schooler though, as you said. 2nd or 3rd grade, was it?Oldbag:\nTh-that doesn't matter! When I was that age, I could pin my old man in 10 seconds, tops!Judge:\nHmm... Your thoughts, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nThat boy is not the killer.Oldbag:\nWhat!? How can you be so sure! Oh, or is it be nice to the kids and mean to your elders day? Whippersnapper!Phoenix:\nI have proof.Oldbag:\nP-proof!?Judge:\nIndeed? Then let's see this proof, Mr. Wright. You have proof that shows the boy could not have committed this murder?Present Cardkey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe scene of the murder, as we all know, was Studio One. However, you need a cardkey to enter Studio One! How could a boy with no formal relation to the studios have a cardkey!?\nLeads to:\n\"I see!\"Present Powers's(?) Photo or Samurai Spear\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! The murder weapon was the Samurai Spear. That very spear is shown here in this photo. How could the boy have taken the spear? It's impossible!\nLeads to:\n\"I see!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThis is my proof!\nJudge:\n... I can't see how that has anything to do with this matter, Mr. Wright? Mr. Wright. There aren't that many pieces of evidence in the Court Record. Please try not to pick the wrong ones!\nPhoenix:\nS-sorry, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nI'll ask again, Mr. Wright.\nLeads back to:\n\"You have proof that shows the boy could not have committed this murder?\"Judge:\nI see! Well, would the witness care to comment on this?Oldbag:\nMrph.Phoenix:\n(The windbag... speechless. This has got to be a first.)Judge:\nVery well! This court will suspend proceedings on the current trial for today. Mr. Edgeworth, please find out more about your witness, Ms. Windy... what was her name?Edgeworth:\nSomething \"Oldbag,\" Your Honor.Judge:\nThen the prosecution will look further into this Oldbag before we continue! That is all. The court is adjourned!Oldbag:\nW-wait a second! I'm not going to just sit here while you run off barking up the wrong tree... me! I'm talking!Maya:\nOh, great, stop the presses! The windbag wants to talk!Judge:\nMs. Oldbag! What is this all about? Have you omitted something from your testimony?Oldbag:\nActually, if you must know, there's something I was told not to talk about.Phoenix:\nN-not to talk about?Edgeworth:\nBy whom!?Phoenix:\n(Huh? You mean it wasn't Edgeworth who told her not to talk...?)Judge:\nW-well, testify!Witness Testimony-- My Lips Were Sealed --Oldbag:\nGlobal Studios wanted me to keep quiet about something.\nThere were... some other people at the studios on the day of the murder.\nThey said they had \"nothing to do with it,\" see?\nSo they told me to just pretend they \"hadn't been at the studios that day.\"\nBut if you're going to go accusing me, I'm not letting them get away scot free!Judge:\nM-Ms. Oldbag! This is crucial information! Why did you keep this from the court until now!?Oldbag:\nAin't you been listening? They told me to shut my trap, and I always do what I'm told.Judge:\n...Phoenix:\n(No, this isn't a bad dream, Your Honor. Witness the power of the Oldbag...)Judge:\nMr. Wright... Your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- My Lips Were Sealed --Oldbag:\nGlobal Studios wanted me to keep quiet about something.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, you were told not to talk?\nOldbag:\nThat's right! By the studio and TV bigwigs, no less!\nEdgeworth:\nWhy didn't I hear about this!?\nOldbag:\nDon't be too hard on yourself, sonny. We were all in on it.Oldbag:\nThere were... some other people at the studios on the day of the murder.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nW-who were these people!?\nOldbag:\nWell, the director and the producer, for starters...\nPhoenix:\nThe... director?\nEdgeworth:\nWe should have known something was fishy! How could they have done a run-through of their action scene without a director? Of course!\nOldbag:\nYes, well, I was surprised no one asked about it.\nPhoenix:\nSo, where were these people?\nOldbag:\nThe director was in the Employee Area all morning for the run-through. He joined the producer around lunchtime and they had a meeting after that.\nEdgeworth:\nWhere!\nOldbag:\nOh, in the Studio Two trailer.\nPhoenix:\nS-Studio Two...!? (There was a Studio Two...?)\nOldbag:\nWell, if you look at the guidemap... Here it is. You go through the gate and all the way to the left.\nPhoenix:\n(The path where the monkey's head was fallen over.)\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Wright... Would you like to continue the cross-examination...?\nPhoenix:\n(I think I've already asked all my questions, but...)\n\n\n\nContinue cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nTake a break\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor.\"Oldbag:\nThey said they had \"nothing to do with it,\" see?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag! This is a trial for murder!\nOldbag:\nI know that, silly! Still, they were pretty convincing about having nothing to do with it. And... they gave me a little bonus on the side.\nPhoenix:\n(So, you got your \"bonus\" and you still talked... Hmm. I think I've asked all the questions I have to ask...)\n\n\n\nContinue cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I guess there's no harm in getting as much info as I can!)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nTake a break\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor.\"Oldbag:\nSo they told me to just pretend they \"hadn't been at the studios that day.\"Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo they were actually in the studio!?\nOldbag:\nYes, the whole day. When they heard about the murder, they beat it before the cops came.\nEdgeworth:\n*grumble* (I'll kill this woman, I swear it...)\nPhoenix:\n(I feel sorry for Edgeworth, almost. She really left him hanging on this one.)Oldbag:\nBut if you're going to go accusing me, I'm not letting them get away scot free!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Them\"...?
